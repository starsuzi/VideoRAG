For a four-hole button, push the needle through the hole opposite the one you started on. Repeat if your button has two holes, or alternate the threading between the two sets of holes if your button has four holes. When the button feels secure, push the needle down, tie a knot in the thread, and cut any excess.",
        "pred": "To sew a button, you will need a seam ripper, two needles, 24 inches of thread, and an extra button if you've lost the original. First, remove the loose button using the seam ripper, cutting the thread while being careful to avoid poking a hole in the shirt fabric. If the button has fallen off or you've lost it, there should be an extra button or two sewn in on the bottom of the shirt placket on the inside that you can use. Next, thread your needle with approximately 24 inches of thread for a single button. You'll need to double thread the needle to give the best possible strength. Pull the thread through the needle, making both ends of the thread equal in length. To form a knot, wrap the thread around your index finger to form an X. Pinch the X between your index finger and thumb, then slide your index finger back, letting the thread roll forward. Bring your middle finger down in front, then pull the thread with your other hand. You will be left with a solid knot that won't come undone. Now it's time to start sewing. We're going to begin by forming an X. Starting on the back side, we're going to pass the needle through the back of the fabric to the front. You'll continue passing through the front, to the back, and back to the front until you formed an X. We are now going to use the X as a guide for sewing the button. Place the button on top of the X. Then take your second needle and place it on top of the button. The second needle will help us to form the shank, which is a bit of thread under the button that will make it more secure and easier to fasten. Now let's sew on the button. You're going to use the exact same pattern that you used to form the X. Pass through the back of the fabric, going through the first button hole. Pass over the second needle and go through the second button hole. You will need to hold the button and second needle in place with your fingers for the first few passes. But after that, it should be held in place by the thread. Continue going front to back, back to front, through all the button holes. You will go through all the button holes approximately six times. Pull the needle through the back of the fabric. Once that is done, you can now remove the spacer needle as it's time to form the shank. Now wrap it around the thread under the button, going around six complete times. After that is done, you'll pull the needle through the fabric again to the back side. It's time to finish up by creating a couple of knots to secure the thread. Pull the needle through the threads in the back and then pull it through the loop. You just formed to create a knot. Do this a few times and you'll be good to go. Use your scissors to cut off any excess thread. Make sure when sewing that you pulled the thread through completely nice and tight. Otherwise you'll end up having loose threads that just look sloppy."

        "question": "How To Roast Meat",
        "gt": "Before roasting beef or other meat, bring it to room temperature to ensure that it will cook evenly. Once the meat is ready to cook, place it in the oven uncovered to caramelize the outer portions. You'll want to cook the meat on a higher temperature to start, then roast it for several hours on a lower temperature for a tender final dish. Finally, use a meat thermometer to determine when the roast is done, cover it with aluminum foil, and allow it to rest for 10-20 minutes to seal in the juices.",
        "pred": "To roast meat, you should first sprinkle the outside of the roast with kosher salt and let it sit at room temperature for at least an hour or in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. This will help the meat retain moisture and become more flavorful. If your roast is regularly shaped, you might want to tie it into a more uniform shape before cooking to help it cook more evenly. Searing the meat before putting it into the oven is also important to get a well-browned crust. Make sure to use the right oven temperature depending on the meat's size and shape. Finally, let the meat rest for at least 10 minutes before carving into it to ensure it stays moist and tender."

Next, clean between the nooks and crannies of the grate with a grill brush, and wipe down the grate with a paper towel dipped in oil to prevent sticking. Then, coat your vegetable lightly with oil and place them on the grill. If the vegetables are small enough to fall through the grate, place them in a grilling basket, or wrap them in tin foil with the top left open.",
        "pred": "To grill vegetables, you need to follow these steps. First, wash and dry the vegetables you want to grill. Some vegetables, such as asparagus, corn, and mushrooms, can be grilled whole. Eggplant, onions, peppers, and zucchini, cook better when they're cut into pieces. Second, oil the vegetables with a light coat of oil to prevent them from sticking to the grates. A little oil also helps get those beautiful grill marks. For extra flavor, add a marinade to your vegetables. To make a simple, all-purpose vegetable marinade, whisk together a quarter cup of olive oil, a quarter cup of lemon juice, a quarter cup of minced, fresh herbs like, basil, oregano, thyme, or rosemary. And if you like garlic, add 2 cloves, finely minced. Pour the marinade over your vegetables and let them steep in a glass bowl or plastic bag for at least one hour. When you're ready to grill, just shake off any extra marinade to prevent any flare-ups. Third, heat your grill. For gas grilling, preheat on medium for ten minutes. If you're using charcoal, fire it up until there's a good coat of ash. After the grill heats up, clean the grates with a wire brush, and wipe them with oil to prevent your food from sticking. Fourth, grill your veggies. If your vegetables are large or whole, you can cook them right on the grill. Smaller vegetables need a grill basket, so they don't fall into the fire. Flip the basket once or twice, to make sure they're cooked evenly. Small or cut vegetables can also be threaded on skewers for kabobs. Be sure to soak bamboo skewers in water for 20 to 30 minutes to keep them from charring. If you're grilling a variety of vegetables, start with the ones that takes the longest to cook, like eggplants, and onions. Asparagus, mushrooms, peppers, and zucchini generally cook a bit faster. Cooking times will vary depending on the type, and size of vegetables. And how crisp or tender you want them to be. Grilling potatoes, carrots, and beets takes an extra step so they don't char on the outside before their tender on the inside. One trick is to boil them in water until they're partially tender. Then, dry them off, brush with oil, and finish on the grill. Another trick: cut them into bite size pieces and grill inside foil packets with oil, butter, herbs and seasonings. Grilled corn is a summer picnic favorite; and there are several great grilling methods to satisfy your family. For basic grilled corn, simply husk the corn, brush with oil and lay it directly on the grill. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, turning frequently so it cooks evenly, and gets nice grill marks. Or, husk the corn, and place each ear on a separate piece of aluminum foil, add a dab of butter, and a dash of seasoning. Seal it up and place it on the grill for 20 to 30 minutes. Turn it occasionally for even cooking. For the most concentrated corn flavor, grill the corn right inside the husk. The trick here is to soak the corn, husk and all, in water for 30 minutes. Drain it, and put it on the ground for about 20 to 30 minutes, turning occasionally, so the corn kernels steam, while the husk chars. From garden, to grill, to plate, enjoy fresh vegetables kissed with the smokey goodness of the grill. If you're already grilling meat, toss on a few veggies."

        "gt": "If your bike\u2019s brake pads are worn to less than \u00bc of an inch, you\u2019ll have to replace the pads. To do so, remove the nuts and washers from your old pads and pull the pads free from the calipers, which squeeze the pads to the tires to make the bike stop. Then, put the new pads in, align them with the tires, and replace the nuts and washers. If you need to adjust your brake\u2019s calipers, tighten the spring on the side that\u2019s moving too much by bending it with pliers. For brake cables that are really stiff or hard to work, remove them completely and lubricate them.",
        "pred": "To fix brakes on a bike, you need to first check if the brakes are rubbing on the rim. If they are, you can tighten the brakes by using the barrel adjusters. If the brakes are not tight enough, you can open up the V brake and tighten the brake cable. You can use an Allen wrench to unscrew the V brake and tighten the brake cable. Once the brake cable is tight, you can close the V brake and tighten the barrel adjuster. This will ensure that the brakes are not rubbing on the wheel and are at the exact tension you want them to be."

Cut the thread and stitch up the other side. Next, use a pencil or similar skinny object to flip the entire shape inside out. Cut a piece of 16 gauge wire slightly longer than the size of your snake and bend the end of the wire so that the sharp edge doesn't rip the fabric. Insert a piece of batting into the hole that you left open where the head would be. Roll the batting together into a snake shape and attach it to the wire using hot glue. Insert the coated wire into the snake and stitch up the 1-inch hole that you left open. Add rhinestones to the snake headband and measure around your head to cut the wire with a little bit of excess. Glue the ends together and lay out the snakes in the desired pattern. Pull the fabric tight over the bottom of the wire and hot glue the extra flap. Repeat this process until all of the snakes are on. To wear the headpiece, lift the top portion of your hair, excluding your bangs, and place the crown over the top of your head.

Next, add two teaspoons of cornstarch, and mix just until well blended. Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag, with a large open star tip. Pipe it onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Start in the center, and work outwards to make a rose, and then build it up. This yields about 15 meringues, and if you use a large 3/4 baking sheet, they all fit on one pan. Use the back of a spoon to create little bowls. This gives your cream and berries a place to sit. Now into the oven they go at 225 degrees fahrenheit, for an hour and 15 minutes. Then turn the oven off and leave them in there another 30 minutes with the door closed. Once they're done, slide them off the baking sheet, and let them cool completely to room temperature.

Then, prepare simple syrup by bringing 1 cup of water and 1 cup of granulated sugar to a boil before reducing the heat and letting it simmer for 4-5 minutes. Once that's done, combine the simple syrup and lemon juice with 3 cups of water in a pitcher. For a fizzy lemonade, use 2 cans of soda water instead. Finally, chill your lemonade in the fridge or serve it in a glass over ice.",
        "pred": "To make fresh squeezed lemonade, you will need to start by bringing two cups of water and two cups of granulated sugar to a simmer on the stove. Give it an occasional stir until the liquid runs clear again, which means that the sugar has completely dissolved in the water. What we're making right now is called a simple syrup. It's actually a chemical process which allows sugar to completely dissolve in water. You could just add sugar to water and make lemonade, but if you take the extra step to heat it, then the sugar is completely dissolved into an actual syrup, which means that there's no separation and no grainy grittiness to your lemonade. Just before this mixture comes to a simmer, you'll see that it's clear again. That is a simple syrup. Simple enough, right? Turn off the heat and set that aside. If you wanted to make lemonade using honey, then you'd simply dissolve two cups of honey in two cups of water just like we did for the sugar. If you want to go completely sugar-free for your lemonade, simply dissolve a quarter cup of ground stevia in two cups of water just like you would with the honey or the sugar. Next, you'll need five pounds of lemons. Now, you can just use two cups of bottled lemon juice, but nothing beats freshly squeezed. Before you juice a lemon, it helps if you roll it between your palm and the countertop to release the juices. It breaks things up inside and you can actually feel that the lemon is squishy. Then just slice it in half right down the middle. Next, it's time to juice your lemons. There's lots of different juicing products on the market, but I like to just use hand juicing tools for lemonade. I like this one in particular because it filters the juice and catches all the seeds and captures the juice in the bottom and it also has measuring markings so I know how much juice I'm getting. Keep on going until you have two cups of lemon juice. There we have it, two cups of freshly squeezed lemon juice. How many lemons it takes to get to two cups of lemon juice is a little hard to tell because lemons vary in how much juice they have inside. Five pounds is a good rule of thumb, although today's lemons were pretty juicy and we only used four pounds. Now, since I don't like pulp in my lemonade, I strain my lemon juice through a strainer into a pitcher. But of course, if you like pulp in your lemonade, feel free to just pour it directly into the pitcher. Next, we'll take that simple syrup and pour it directly in with our lemon juice. Give this a stir and what you have now is lemonade concentrate. You can actually freeze this so if you want to make it in big batches, you can freeze it in portions to serve throughout the summer. That way you can have freshly squeezed lemonade all summer long. To serve, you'll just add water and ice to taste. Some people like their lemonade super tart like me and so we add a little bit less water. But if you are a normal individual and like yours a little more thinned out and an even balance between sweet and sour, you'll add a little bit more water. So just keep on tasting it and adjust the water to your personal taste. Now, if you wanted to turn this into a fruit lemonade, you'd simply add your fruit to the lemonade concentrate. So you can add raspberries for raspberry lemonade, strawberries for strawberry lemonade, or maybe even some blueberries for blueberry lemonade. Just smash them up and mix them in with that concentrate. Thanks for watching. You can find the full written recipe in the video description.

Finally, create small holes and crevices in the material to give the insects places to hide and take shelter.",
        "pred": "To make an insect hotel, you will need four sections of wood about 15 centimeters or six inches long, some thin shingles to serve as roof tiles, some strong string, plus a plank of wood wide enough to form a backplate to your hotel. To avoid harming the insects, use untreated wood. To fill the hotel, you'll need a selection of hollow stems. Bamboo canes are ideal for this. You'll also need a drill, a screwdriver and some screws, a hammer and tax and some pruners. Begin by making the walls to your hotel, attach the four sections of wood to each other using the screws. You may need to make a pilot hole for each screw before securing it into place. Join up the four walls so that one end overlaps the other. With the walls complete, attach the backplate to create a snug seal. You can mark the footprint of the walls onto the plate as a guide before screwing it into position. Now for the roof shingles. Use the tax to simply hammer these into place, overlapping the shingles to help rain to run off and keep the inside of the hotel dry. If you wish, you can now paint the hotel with a natural non-toxic paint or wood stain to give a colorful finish. Allow the paint to dry before continuing. It's now time for the bedding materials. Cut the stems or bamboo to length. The bamboo should sit flush with the walls of the hotel like this. Pack them into place to give a good solid finish. Drill two holes into the top of the backplate, then thread some string through. Tie the ends into a knot, then hang your hotel up in a dry, sheltered place and full sun or dappled shade. In among trees and shrubs as ideal, or you could hammer your hotel into the ease of a garden shed or outbuilding. If you live in an area where termites are a problem, be sure to site your bug hotel well away from any buildings and keep it clear of the ground. A simple alternative to a bamboo cane hotel is to drill lots of holes of varying sizes into a solid block of wood. Avoid drilling all the way through the block. You can also add a shingle roof for a decorative finish. Attach a vine-eye, thread through your string, then hang up into position. As you can see, it's very easy to make a safe and secure habitat for beneficial bugs to thrive."

All you need to do is put something sticky on top of a flat object, like some double-sided tape on a piece of card. Alternatively, you can buy ready-made sticky traps from a hardware store. Place your traps in dark places where spiders may hide, like under the utility sink or the water heater. You can also place a bottle lid filled with water next to your trap, since spiders are attracted by water. Another good place for your traps is beside baseboards, since spiders and insects like to walk along them.",

Measure, cut, and pin the fabric to ensure it is the right size. After you have checked your measurements, sew your shade together and glue thin strips of stiffening material to attach the fabric to the wood. You'll then want to add plastic loops to the battens and attach a cord so you can open and close the shade.",
        "pred": "To make a roman shade, you will need to gather the necessary materials, which include drapery fabric, drapery lining, wood dowels, a metal rod or slat of wood, blind cord, thread, a cord lock or a cord cleat, pulleys or eye screws, rings, 5/8\" stitch witchery, a hand sewing needle, pins, a ruler, scissors, a fabric marker, a pull end which is optional, and also a staple gun, iron, drill, and screws. Once you have all the materials, you will need to cut the drapery fabric to be 3 inches wider than the finished width of the roman shade and 5 inches longer. Cut the drapery lining 1 inch shorter than the finished width and the same height as the drapery fabric. With right sides facing, pin one side of the drapery fabric and lining together. Sew down the length with a 1/2 inch seam allowance. Line up the other side, pin, and sew. Center the lining on the back so there's an inch of the drapery fabric on either side and pin the bottom. Sew across, again with a 1/2 inch seam allowance. Center the drapery lining again on the top and pin down the sides. Next, figure out the spacing for the dowels. This will differ based on the height of your window, but generally 8-12 inches between the dowels works well. The amount below the bottom dowel should be half the distance between dowels plus 1 inch. The amount above the top dowel is less important, but it should be at least as much as the spacing between dowels. With the wrong side of the drapery fabric facing up, measure up from the bottom for the location of the first dowel. After the dowels are added, the bottom will be hemmed up 2 and 1/2 inches so add that amount to the bottom, plus the seam allowance. For me, that's a total of 8 and 1/2 inches. Measure and mark the distance for the rest of the dowels. Fold the fabric in half and mark the other side as well. To make pockets for the dowels, cut 2 inch strips of the lining that are the width of your shade. Cut enough for each dowel. Fold the pieces in half and iron. Then sew the raw edges together with a 1/4 inch seam allowance. Take the stitch witchery and lay it on top of the strip. With the iron on the steam setting, hold it above the stitch witchery so it melts slightly and sticks to the fabric. Extend the markings for the dowels to the edges. Lay the strip across the fabric so the area between the fold and seam is centered on the markings. You can use a straight edge to straighten the strip before pinning it in a couple of places. Iron to bond the stitch witchery to the fabric. Next, insert the dowels. Clip the bottom corners and turn the shade right side out. Starting with the bottom, carefully pull the dowels up through the top opening. Poke out the corners and iron the edges. Fold the bottom up 2 and 1/2 inches and iron. You can sew across with a regular straight stitch, but if you don't want the thread to be visible on the front, use the blind hem stitch on your machine. Pin so the points are facing down and the other end is overhanging the edge. Fold the hem under so the end of the fabric is showing about 1/4 of an inch. Attach the blind hem foot which has an extra dividing piece to guide the fabric. Position the fabric so the fold is against the left side of the guide. Find the blind hem stitch on your machine. There may be several variations. I'm using number 11 on this machine. When you start sewing, it will stitch on the right side for a number of stitches, and then jump over to the left side for 1 stitch. This way most of the stitches will be hidden on the back, and the few that are on the front won't be noticeable as long as the thread matches. Next I'm going to sew on the rings that will guide the cord. There will be a ring near the ends of each dowel. You'll need to leave enough room on the edges so the last cord can go through the pulley and cord lock if you're using them. Put the pulley and cord lock together with them sharing a screw hole. Measure from where the cord will come up through the pulley to the end of the cord lock base. This is 2 and 1/2 inches for me, so mark this distance from the edge of the shade on both sides. For most shade widths, you may need more rings per dowel. Thread a hand stitching needle and go through the lining and the ring a couple of times."

        "question": "How To Deep Fry at Home",
        "gt": "To deep fry at home, fill a pot with enough canola or vegetable oil to submerge the food you're frying halfway. Next, turn the burner to high, heat the oil to about 350 \u00b0F, and carefully place your food in the oil using tongs. Then, use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the food once it turns golden brown and crispy. Finally, place the fried food on stacked paper towels to drain before you serve it!",
        "pred": "To deep fry at home, you need to follow a few steps. First, you need to preheat the oil to the correct temperature. You can do this by dropping a cube of bread into the oil and checking if it sizzles in 20 seconds, which means the oil is around 190\u00b0C. If it sizzles in 40 seconds, the oil is around 180\u00b0C, and if it takes 60 seconds, the oil is around 160\u00b0C. Once the oil is at the correct temperature, you can add the food to the oil. Make sure to use a pan with deep sides and fill it no more than half full with a flavorless oil such as vegetable or sunflower oil. You should also leave at least a 10 cm gap from the level of the oil to the top of the pan to allow for the oil rising and bubbling during cooking. When frying, make sure to use long tongs or a slotted deep fry spoon and remove the food carefully. Smaller pieces of food will cook faster and more evenly than larger pieces. If you are deep frying larger pieces of raw meat, make sure that the oil isn't so hot that the outside burns before the inside is thoroughly cooked. Cook in small batches, adding too much food at once will lower the temperature of the oil. Allow the oil to return to the correct cooking temperature each time before adding the next batch. Once the food is cooked, drain it on a kitchen towel to absorb the excess oil and keep the food crisp. Season with sea salt while still hot and serve immediately."

        "question": "How To Flambe",
        "gt": "To create a successful flamb\u00e9, you'll need to use a liquor that is 80-proof or 40% alcohol by volume. When the food is ready, remove the pan from the burner and slowly add the warm liquor. Touch a long match or a barbecue lighter to the edge of the pan to ignite the food. Then, put the pan back on the burner and shake it gently so that the flames coat the food evenly. You can let the fire burn out naturally or cover the pan with a lid to preserve some of the alcohol flavor.",
        "pred": "To flambe safely, you should use a pan with a long handle and heat the food until it is hot. Do not flambe over the stove or under the kitchen hood. Never place your head or any part of your body over the pan and always be prepared for the blaze. Use a small amount of alcohol and pour it from a container, never directly from the bottle. Always ignite with long match sticks or with a long reach lighter. Flambe burns off the alcohol but leaves great flavour from the liquid. Normally, let the flames go out by themselves but if the flambe gets out of hand then simply place a metal lid on top to stop it."

        "gt": "To blow the best bubbles with bubblegum, start by chewing a piece of gum until it\u2019s soft and smooth, then use your tongue to roll the gum into a ball and flatten it against the roof of your mouth. Next, open your teeth slightly and push your tongue through the flattened gum, moving it vertically in front of your teeth. Gently blow as if you are sighing until you can feel the air begin to fill the gum and turn it into a bubble. Remove your tongue from the gum and keep blowing as long as you can, or until the bubble bursts.",
        "pred": "To blow a bubble with bubblegum, you need to follow a series of steps. First, you need to buy some bubblegum. You can buy gum at pretty much every corner store. Chewing gums can be used to make bubbles, but they won't be as big and they'll usually pop too easily. To start off, select a pack of bubblegum like Double Bubble or Bazooka. Generally, if there is a picture of a bubble on the package, it's a good choice. Some gums are also stickier, making them harder to remove from your face when they pop. Usually, if you chew these gums a little longer before blowing a bubble, they won't be quite as sticky. Gums with less sugar often have a stronger gum base for making bubbles. Gum bases contain a long molecule that adds elasticity to the gum. The right amount will make for the best texture for bubbles. Avoid old gums. If your gum is stale, it will be more dry, harder to chew, and bad for making bubbles. Use fresh gum to get the best results. To chew the gum, you need to roll the gum into a ball with your tongue. Use the roof of your mouth to steady the gum in place while you work the ball shape. It doesn't have to be a perfect circular shape, just so that gum is compacted. Move this ball of gum so that it sits right behind your front teeth. Use your tongue to flatten the ball into a small, flat circle. Use the back of your teeth to help flatten it by pushing the ball into them. Open your teeth slightly and extend your tongue until it extends out of your mouth and is covered by a thin, stretched layer of bubblegum. You'll need to be very gentle or you might poke your tongue right through. If that does happen, just form the ball again and start over. Keep practicing as this step can be difficult. Practice in front of a mirror so you can see when the tip of the gum is in the right position. To blow the bubble, you need to breathe air into the pocket of gum around your tongue. Blow gently until you can feel the air begin to fill the gum and start to push the gum out of your mouth in a bubble shape. Many people make the mistake of blowing just out of their lips rather than using breath from deeper within. Lip breath is not strong enough to produce a proper bubble so be sure to put more energy into it. The appropriate way to push air into the gum is like producing a heavy sigh. Use your diaphragm to push the air and exhale. Once the air pressure starts expanding the gum, you can remove your tongue. The edges of your teeth will help to keep the gum in place. Keep blowing slow and steady as you gradually expand the gum. Keep your mouth open. Resist the urge to close your lips after removing your tongue. Keeping your mouth in an open position will give you a larger area to push air through. To keep blowing as long as you can, use slow, even breaths. This will allow your gum time to expand. See how big you can make a bubble before it pops. For the biggest bubbles, blow bubbles inside. Stay away from wind and hot or cold temperatures. Cold air and wind can pop your bubble early, while hot air can make it so pliable it gets limp. To seal off the bubble, press your lips together slightly to close the bubble. This will prevent the bubble from getting more air and becoming bigger than desired or from allowing the air in the bubble to escape. If you want to avoid the mess of a bubble popping in your face, you can draw the bubble back into your mouth and pop it with your tongue. Practice, practice, practice. You may not succeed the first few tries but that's all part of the fun. Just keep trying until it happens for you and you get the hang of what it feels like. Blowing bubbles can take some getting used to for your jaw, mouth, and diaphragm. With practice, you will strengthen the muscles and the process will become easier."

        "gt": "To use a grill pan, preheat it over medium-high heat for 5 minutes before cooking on it, which will allow the entire surface of the pan to get hot. While the pan is heating up, brush oil onto the food you'll be cooking. Avoid putting oil directly in the grill pan since it could burn and ruin the flavor of your food. Once the grill pan is preheated, put the food in the pan and cover it with aluminum foil so it cooks faster. Let the food cook in the pan and use tongs to flip it once halfway through the cooking time.",
        "pred": "To use a grill pan, first, you need to clean it thoroughly with soap and water. Then, dry it with a towel and coat it with vegetable oil. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and place the pan upside down on a sheet of tin foil. Let it cook for an hour and then let it cool in the oven. Once it's done, you can use it to cook your favorite dishes."

        "question": "How To Dewax Lemons",
        "gt": "Lemons are often coated in a special wax to keep the peel glossy and you may want to remove this if you plan to zest the lemon. One of the easiest ways to do this is by using vinegar to make a fruit and vegetable wash. Combine one part white vinegar with three parts water in a spray bottle. Then, spray the solution over the lemon peels and allow it to sit for 2 - 5 minutes. Next, scrub the lemons with a scrubbing brush under cool, running water to remove the vinegar solution and the wax.",
        "pred": "To dewax lemons, you can put them in a bowl of water with a couple of tablespoons of vinegar for 30 minutes. This will help remove any wax on the lemons. After that, rinse them off with water and dry them before using them in your recipes."
