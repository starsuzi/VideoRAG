        "gt": "If your toilet's ready for a new seat, start by measuring the distance between the 2 bolts on the toilet bowl so you know what size seat to get. Most toilet seats are the same size, but it's better to check just in case! Once you've bought a new seat that fits, use a flathead screwdriver to pry off the caps on the bolts that attach the old seat to the bowl. If there aren't any caps, you can skip this step. Next, use an adjustable wrench to loosen and remove the nut on each bolt so you can lift the old seat off. When the old seat is off, hold the new seat over the toilet bowl, and drop the bolts into the empty holes where the old bolts were. Finish by threading the nuts onto the bolts to tighten the new seat into place.",

First, select an appropriate button and matching thread for the article of clothing. Check to see if the manufacturer included extra buttons. Cut a suitable length of thread with scissors (12 to 18 inches is generally enough), and thread and knot your needle. Position the button and check to make sure it lines up with the buttonhole. If you are replacing a button, look for tiny holes in the fabric left by the previous button, and put your new button there. Make your first stitch by inserting the needle into the back of the fabric (where the knotted end won't show) and through one of the holes in the button. Be sure to pull the thread completely through on each stitch to keep it from bunching up. Take a pin or a toothpick, and center it on top of the button. This will create space between the button and the fabric, so that later the button will slip easily into the buttonhole. For now, hold the pin in place with your finger. Insert the needle through the next hole, into the fabric, and all the way through. This stitch will now hold the pin in place. Insert the needle back up through the fabric and into the first hole. If you have a four-hole button, stitch up through a new hole. Pull the thread all the way through. Keep repeating these stitches until the button is secure. This will usually take eight complete stitches. On your last stitch, end with a double knot on the back side of the fabric. Now cut the excess thread and remove the pin.

Then, prepare simple syrup by bringing 1 cup of water and 1 cup of granulated sugar to a boil before reducing the heat and letting it simmer for 4-5 minutes. Once that's done, combine the simple syrup and lemon juice with 3 cups of water in a pitcher. For a fizzy lemonade, use 2 cans of soda water instead. Finally, chill your lemonade in the fridge or serve it in a glass over ice.",
        "pred": "To make fresh squeezed lemonade, you will need to start by bringing two cups of water and two cups of granulated sugar to a simmer on the stove. Give it an occasional stir until the liquid runs clear again, which means that the sugar has completely dissolved in the water. What we're making right now is called a simple syrup. It's actually a chemical process which allows sugar to completely dissolve in water. You could just add sugar to water and make lemonade, but if you take the extra step to heat it, then the sugar is completely dissolved into an actual syrup, which means that there's no separation and no grainy grittiness to your lemonade. Just before this mixture comes to a simmer, you'll see that it's clear again. That is a simple syrup. Simple enough, right? Turn off the heat and set that aside. If you wanted to make lemonade using honey, then you'd simply dissolve two cups of honey in two cups of water just like we did for the sugar. If you want to go completely sugar-free for your lemonade, simply dissolve a quarter cup of ground stevia in two cups of water just like you would with the honey or the sugar. Next, you'll need five pounds of lemons. Now, you can just use two cups of bottled lemon juice, but nothing beats freshly squeezed. Before you juice a lemon, it helps if you roll it between your palm and the countertop to release the juices. It breaks things up inside and you can actually feel that the lemon is squishy. Then just slice it in half right down the middle. Next, it's time to juice your lemons. There's lots of different juicing products on the market, but I like to just use hand juicing tools for lemonade. I like this one in particular because it filters the juice and catches all the seeds and captures the juice in the bottom and it also has measuring markings so I know how much juice I'm getting. Keep on going until you have two cups of lemon juice. There we have it, two cups of freshly squeezed lemon juice. How many lemons it takes to get to two cups of lemon juice is a little hard to tell because lemons vary in how much juice they have inside. Five pounds is a good rule of thumb, although today's lemons were pretty juicy and we only used four pounds. Now, since I don't like pulp in my lemonade, I strain my lemon juice through a strainer into a pitcher. But of course, if you like pulp in your lemonade, feel free to just pour it directly into the pitcher. Next, we'll take that simple syrup and pour it directly in with our lemon juice. Give this a stir and what you have now is lemonade concentrate. You can actually freeze this so if you want to make it in big batches, you can freeze it in portions to serve throughout the summer. That way you can have freshly squeezed lemonade all summer long. To serve, you'll just add water and ice to taste. Some people like their lemonade super tart like me and so we add a little bit less water. But if you are a normal individual and like yours a little more thinned out and an even balance between sweet and sour, you'll add a little bit more water. So just keep on tasting it and adjust the water to your personal taste. Now, if you wanted to turn this into a fruit lemonade, you'd simply add your fruit to the lemonade concentrate. So you can add raspberries for raspberry lemonade, strawberries for strawberry lemonade, or maybe even some blueberries for blueberry lemonade. Just smash them up and mix them in with that concentrate. Thanks for watching. You can find the full written recipe in the video description.

        "question": "How To Grow Beetroot",
        "gt": "If you want to grow beetroot, pick a spot with rich, fertile soil that receives plenty of sunlight, although a little shade is okay. Till the soil 3-4 inches deep and remove any weeds, stones, or other debris. Sow your seeds or plant your seedlings after the last frost of the year. Water your plants daily until the leaves begin to sprout, then water them every 10-14 days if the weather is dry, and not at all during periods of normal rainfall.",
        "pred": "To grow beetroot, you need to sow the seeds 1 to 2 cm apart in rows that are about 15 cm apart. Each beetroot seed produces several plants, so you need to thin them out to give them enough room to grow. Weeds will also grow alongside the beetroot plants, so you need to remove them at least twice while the plants are still tiny. Loosen the soil around the beetroot plants after the second weeding and place mulch along the rows to reduce further weed growth. Fertilize with a mixture of molasses, foric acid, and an all-purpose liquid fertilizer as the beetroot grows. Continue to thin them so that they do not become overcrowded and use a liquid fertilizer at least twice during the growing period. You can pick the baby beetroot in salads or smoothies, and some beetroot will grow faster than the others, so pick these and allow the others to grow. Make sure to water your beetroot plants at least twice a week if it doesn't rain."

Next, open your teeth slightly and push your tongue through the flattened gum, moving it vertically in front of your teeth. Gently blow as if you are sighing until you can feel the air begin to fill the gum and turn it into a bubble. Remove your tongue from the gum and keep blowing as long as you can, or until the bubble bursts.",
        "pred": "To blow a bubble with bubblegum, you need to follow a series of steps. First, you need to buy some bubblegum. You can buy gum at pretty much every corner store. Chewing gums can be used to make bubbles, but they won't be as big and they'll usually pop too easily. To start off, select a pack of bubblegum like Double Bubble or Bazooka. Generally, if there is a picture of a bubble on the package, it's a good choice. Some gums are also stickier, making them harder to remove from your face when they pop. Usually, if you chew these gums a little longer before blowing a bubble, they won't be quite as sticky. Gums with less sugar often have a stronger gum base for making bubbles. Gum bases contain a long molecule that adds elasticity to the gum. The right amount will make for the best texture for bubbles. Avoid old gums. If your gum is stale, it will be more dry, harder to chew, and bad for making bubbles. Use fresh gum to get the best results. To chew the gum, you need to roll the gum into a ball with your tongue. Use the roof of your mouth to steady the gum in place while you work the ball shape. It doesn't have to be a perfect circular shape, just so that gum is compacted. Move this ball of gum so that it sits right behind your front teeth. Use your tongue to flatten the ball into a small, flat circle. Use the back of your teeth to help flatten it by pushing the ball into them. Open your teeth slightly and extend your tongue until it extends out of your mouth and is covered by a thin, stretched layer of bubblegum. You'll need to be very gentle or you might poke your tongue right through. If that does happen, just form the ball again and start over. Keep practicing as this step can be difficult. Practice in front of a mirror so you can see when the tip of the gum is in the right position. To blow the bubble, you need to breathe air into the pocket of gum around your tongue. Blow gently until you can feel the air begin to fill the gum and start to push the gum out of your mouth in a bubble shape. Many people make the mistake of blowing just out of their lips rather than using breath from deeper within. Lip breath is not strong enough to produce a proper bubble so be sure to put more energy into it. The appropriate way to push air into the gum is like producing a heavy sigh. Use your diaphragm to push the air and exhale. Once the air pressure starts expanding the gum, you can remove your tongue. The edges of your teeth will help to keep the gum in place. Keep blowing slow and steady as you gradually expand the gum. Keep your mouth open. Resist the urge to close your lips after removing your tongue. Keeping your mouth in an open position will give you a larger area to push air through. To keep blowing as long as you can, use slow, even breaths. This will allow your gum time to expand. See how big you can make a bubble before it pops. For the biggest bubbles, blow bubbles inside. Stay away from wind and hot or cold temperatures. Cold air and wind can pop your bubble early, while hot air can make it so pliable it gets limp. To seal off the bubble, press your lips together slightly to close the bubble. This will prevent the bubble from getting more air and becoming bigger than desired or from allowing the air in the bubble to escape. If you want to avoid the mess of a bubble popping in your face, you can draw the bubble back into your mouth and pop it with your tongue. Practice, practice, practice. You may not succeed the first few tries but that's all part of the fun. Just keep trying until it happens for you and you get the hang of what it feels like. Blowing bubbles can take some getting used to for your jaw, mouth, and diaphragm. With practice, you will strengthen the muscles and the process will become easier."
