Hello
In this video I am going to show how to cultivate Broccoli in a pot (polly bag)
the mixed soil I am using composite of
50% normal soil
25% compost
wooden dust 25%
see how I am planting broccoli
after 24 days
now I am applying some compost and wooden small particles
wooden particles are to decrease the weight of the soil
and it will help to keep the compost away from the base
but remember one thing
mustard cake solution with water need to be provided at a regular interval of 10 days
after another 25 days
after another 26 days, broccoli started showing up
after another 5 days,
now I am breaking the flower
after another 25 days
this is the same broccoli plant
from which I have collected the main flower previously
here was the main flower before
after the main flower
these new flower started blooming
from one plant you will get flower three times
from every single branches there is a broccoli
when I will cut this broccoli
from these branches there will be a new broccoli
from this also new broccoli will grow
remember one thing, regular water and
and
mustard cake solution with water as fertilizer need to be applied
now I am cutting these broccoli
