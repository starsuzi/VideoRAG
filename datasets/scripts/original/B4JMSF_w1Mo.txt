it and in my right mind so with that
being said my plan today is to cook
dinner so I'm going to tell yall what
I'm
cooking I am
cooking
oxtails beef
oils okay
and I got four
packs four packs of
oxtails my husband's barbecuing some
chicken which we have right
here over here to the
stove cooking my collard
[Music]
greens making potato salad and I'm also
going to make um
man my potato pies today so I'm going to
be busy today and um I just want to show
y'all a little bit of how I cook my oxs
first I'm going to rinse
them come to the
[Music]
R them
off and I got some uh a combination of
the small ones and the kind of medium
size my husband don't like the real big
ones
so that's how we going to do
that going rinse all four packs
I'm pretty sure you got well I don't
even have to say that y'all know how to
rinse your meat
off and I'm using cold water
bless
you so after I rinse them off I'm going
to season them and I'm going to Brown
them so I'll be back guys I'm back and
my oxtails are all washed so what I'm
going to do now I'm going to start about
to Brown them and I put a little bit of
oil in the bottom of my pan so I'm going
to season
them in my in a
separate
Bowl
okay and take this off I don't know why
I didn't take the lid off before I
started here do
[Music]
um I'm using my L seasoning
salt y'all hear the radio Cory don't
turn the radio
[Music]
on got my little onion powder
Mia
Mia little black pepper not much cuz
black pepper changes the taste of your
food whether you know it or
not so a little bit goes a long way
[Music]
[Applause]
my children was shocked in here y'all I
was dancing doing the belly roll and I
guess my daughter didn't feel like I
knew how to do that and she was oh mama
I see you over there doing the belly
roll oh look at Mom how you do
that of course she know how to do it she
just playing the
radio more onion powder on this
side and I don't know why my children
trying to play cooking they got my other
pots and they on the floor look at them
on the floor they call they s
[Music]
cooking put a little
salt okay and I'm not going to put salt
on both sides cuz eventually I'm going
to um
seas in the other side so I'm going put
this side down first in my
pan oh my goodness that smell good
already wait a minute B I'm doing
something
[Applause]
okay I got my stove I had my stove on
five which right now my pen is tooking
like it's on high I'm going to turn it
down on four cuz I don't want it to burn
but I do want it to
Brown so I'm going tell you while that's
doing that I'm going to start to see
some more of
them and try not to put too many in your
pan you see how I got those spaced out
that'll keep your pan cooking evenly cuz
if you put too much stuff in there it'll
knock the heat down to the pan and it'll
start to boil your meat instead of
Browning
okay so I got these
in I mean you can put whatever seasoning
you like on yours but I'm going to do a
little bit of seasoned
salt onion powder again I love onion
powder y'all so and you I hope y'all can
tell because look at the big size I
buy
yeah and a little black pepper no B
don't get no more SP out the
draw and my
salt get get
one no not my measuring spoons I need
those okay I'm have to buy y'all
something to play with no not my
measuring
cup go to Dollar Tree and buy them on
set to play
with cuz I want my girls to be excited
about
cooking so not get them used to handling
the uh the
utensils okay so I done season this side
and um let me check on these see how
they doing see how it's starting to
Brown that's what you
want
okay put a little salt on this
side
okay and turn them over
[Applause]
[Applause]
what
okay so that's what you want them to
look like brown them on all sides even
this side like that that's uncooked you
turn it over as best you can even if you
have to lean them up against the side of
the pan like
that to get it to Brown on the sides you
know that's how I do I mean everybody
may not want to do that and even on this
side like that I just stand it up in the
[Applause]
pot y'all my 15-e wedding anniversary is
coming up on February the
20th and I count it all as a blessing I
don't
know we haven't planned a trip yet but
um we'll see what we going to do I told
him I didn't want to go right now in
February because it is cold here and I
don't want to go you know out of town
and we don't go anywhere out of the
state of
Florida um I like to go to Orlando and
that's just
[Music]
me so I like to go to Orlando and um
when I go I want it to be good and hot
so we can get out and see the sight and
not have to worry about putting on a
jacket
okay so I'm turning these over on the
other side so I can see him he want
something to
drink turning them over so I can season
the other side if I can get them turned
over
okay now you be careful when you adding
your seasoned salt and you're adding
salt
um because this salt seasoned salt has
extra salt in it and you don't want to
make your food too salty okay now you
can can get they sell the kind that
don't have salt in
it if you PL if you one of those people
that just have to have salt and
everything um even though I use seasoned
salt I try to use a
little um salt behind it just to pop up
that the flavor so you can actually
taste all of your seasonings to me I
don't care what kind of seasoning you
put on food if you don't have a little
salt in there to balance it out and to
bring out those flavors it's not going
to all you know go together
so that's just how I feel so you can see
they're all
Browning and no I'm not using the same
Tong you know touching raw food with
food that's already being cooked this is
the one I'm
using for the cook
food and this is the one I'm using for
the raw food okay so that one is in
there and it's a long
one got that one and this is the one I
use for over
here so guys I'm going
to finish cooking these and I'll be back
in a few minutes guys I have browned all
of my
oxtails and they are in this big pot now
I am de glazing My Pan I have my
onion and my bell pepper in the bottom
of my
pan and this is how I de
glaze you see all the little look like
it's burned on at the bottom that's all
the good stuff that's all the season and
the flavor that you want to be in your
food so what I'm doing is I'm Browning
or just saut√©ing my onion and my bell
pepper on until they are soft
okay see they picking up all that
goodness off the bottom of the
pan
okay now to get all of that that won't
come off to deglaze your pan now you
don't have to do this with the onion in
the Bell puff in but I do it so that I
can get all my flavor you can um
do your onion and your bell pepper first
take them out then you can deglaze your
pan for those of you that don't know how
to do it um now here we go I have some
water and I'm just going to pour the
water in and it don't take much you see
when it's doing
that it's heating up the pan and it's
loosening up all that stuff that's stuck
on the bottom and you just work it with
your if you have a non-stick skillet you
want to use something that's not going
to scratch the bottom you just work it
to loosen it all
up
okay I have had this this pan set for
about 8 years and I I got it from JC
pennis and I have never used um like a
wood spatula I've always used whatever I
have in my kitchen and you see it has
held up I paid $179 for this pot set and
it is the1
1810 stain L Steel bottom the
bottom um is really really thick and
that's what you
want cuz it regulates your heat and
everything so you see that it look like
it's making a little gravy at the
bottom because it's Del glazing all of
that good stuff off the bottom of your
pan now you might need a little extra
water like I
do okay I'm going to turn my heat up a
little bit cuz the water has lowered my
temperature and once it starts to
[Music]
boil um you will see the
difference so I keep moving it around
making sure that it's not
sticking cuz you don't want it to get
burnt on
you see my bell peppers are getting nice
and
soft but they don't have to be mushy I
want all of those flavors to come
together the bell pepper oh I love bell
peppers in my food y'all in certain
things you know you see it's starting to
boil let that do it for about another 5
minutes 10 minutes
top depends on what size pan you have
and what you're going to
do after that you're going to pour all
of this into this pot on top of here so
here we
go now you see there's not much left on
the
bottom okay let me move this over here
to the
sink rub me some water in that
let that be soaking go and this is what
I have now ooh that looks so
goodoo I can't wait to eat now what I'm
going to do I'm going to move this pot
to this eye and I'm going to feel it I'm
not going to cover it but feel it like
right here with water okay because you
don't want to put too much water in your
pot boil over so like right
here or halfway full is where I fill it
with water and I have in my big mixer
Bowl some water
already you see it was just enough and
this is a 3/4 Bowl I got from
Walmart and they come in handy cuz you
can mix your pancakes and all kind of
stuff in that bowl in that One Bowl I
like dump bowls you know where you just
throw everything in there and it's got a
little handle and a little spout and we
good to go so here we go
guys this is not my finished look but
this gives you a general idea of what
it's look like what it's going to look
like now I'm going to add I'm going to
stir this all
together
okay get all my onion and bell pepper
down in there
okay now I'm going to add just a little
bit of salt cuz anytime you add more
water to something you add the need to
add a little extra
salt push them down in
there
okay now later
on well let me go ahead and do it now
I'm going show youall what I'm doing
y'all see my little kids they done lined
up all my
pots and y'all can see my pots have been
well used they usually have the little
stuff that you could clean this off with
in Home Depot but they haven't had it
and Walmart don't sell it and I didn't
find it in Lowe's so I'm going to try
again today I got to take my light bulbs
back but it's some stuff that you could
put on here to clean clean that that
off but this is what I mean you see how
thick from here to there that's the 1810
stainless steel bottom okay yeah it's
well used these bad boys are almost 10
years old and this is a one of the pots
that's a part of a part of the pot set
that I
have so let me show y'all what I'm
getting ready to do while I'm on camera
right quick I got my little measuring
cup
okay let me find the
flour this is how I
make my thickening for any of my stews
or if I'm if I want gravy added to my
pot roast
or or anything like that I got some
water that I pour in there
okay now oh I picked up a fork is that
off pay attention
girl okay now all of your seasonings
that you put in your on your meat is
what you're going to put in your
thickness I have some water and I'm
going to put a
few tablespoons of flour that's one
that's two okay and stir that all
together and this is going to be my
thickening this is what's going to give
it that thick
gravy cuz I like my juice to stick to my
rice and my meat
y'all that's why my behind can't lose no
weight but that's all right too
[Music]
okay got my R to clean up my
[Applause]
mess oo got dog that pot is
hot so that's my thickening y'all see
and you can keep stirring it to get some
of the lumps out but eventually they
will cook out if they not too big so I
take it and I like to push it up against
the side of the cup like that you see to
mash out the um the
lumps let me see if I can get
