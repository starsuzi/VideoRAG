hi guys today I'm going to teach you how
to make a clay Rose it looks really
elegant and pretty it's really easy and
you can use it for jewelry or anything
so what you're going to need is Clay of
course and I chose
white and um you just want to cut out a
lot of these
chunks they don't have to be exactly the
same size but they need to be similar
and then you're going to roll these into
[Music]
balls so you want like about eight or
nine depending on how big your flower is
if you want a really big flower then you
should have more and if you want a
smaller flower then you might want like
smaller ones and
so just going to grab it and
just flatten
[Music]
it you want to flatten all of them to
make a petal they don't need to be like
really circular or anything they could
be ovals or whatever it's just cuz it's
natural and what you're going to do to
start the middle is roll it
[Music]
up so it's really simple just like that
and just you use your fingers and sort
of flatten out the top to make it look
natural I don't know if you could see
that
yeah and flatten the
rest so you have these
petals it really doesn't need to be
perfect I
mean and just put it onto the base just
like roll it
around I placed mine right where the Gap
right here is so and then I'm just going
to also flatten out the
sides makes it look more realistic and
it Smothers out some of the rough edges
you might get when you're
using
clay and you go around and around okay
so as you can see I got um about four
roses I mean four petals sorry and I'm
just going to keep wrapping around
until I get it gets to like how big I
want it so I guess I'll just
add two
more sorry about
that and it looks a bit ovalish but you
know roses aren't always pretty
perfect so here's my rose I know it
doesn't
look that pretty
but you know so I'm just going to roll
out the bottom and pinch it
out and after you bake your clay or let
it Harden or whatever I think it look
really pretty if you dust it with some
sort of really fine glitter it makes it
look really cute but that's just a
suggestion you could do whatever you
want I hope this video really helped you
out and if you if you have any more
questions or comments post it down there
