hi guys uh welcome back to ra review uh
today we're going to demonstrate how
this mandoline works it's a brand new
item from Kitchen EG first we're going
to unbox it and then we're going to just
cut these uh veggies and Apple so um
let's open this box and see uh again
it's a brand new item uh kitchen a makes
it and comes with balls and
um pretty unique box just open it like
that and it shows you a few examples um
let's open
it okay so this is the first time we
ever uh going to use it it's not like I
know what I'm doing but um it's pretty
self-explained it's not a
complicated piece of
equipment uh
instructions these bowls are
plastic and um I'm not sure if they're
BPA free but we'll put them on the side
for now
nice little container let's put it
here just make sure uh be very careful
with these blades I'm sure they're
pretty
sharp
okay that's about it guys that's what's
in the
box um Mand in itself um let's see how
many containers see it comes with
three yeah I think that's it oh one more
so
four and let's see what's in here this
is more like a St G container I think
you can use it for food
too all right these are actually these
are actual
blades yeah this is a um storage for
your blades it has a little
um lines over here to slide these blaves
in so they don't
move yeah that's pretty
neat all right guys uh we're going to
demonstrate so keep tuned see you okay
guys so we did wash it um we're ready to
use again uh it's not hard to use this
so I mean if you don't want to read
instructions it's pretty self-explained
but it's it's better to read them uh
because uh sometimes it doesn't work and
you'll be wondering why it doesn't work
so it does have a flat BL blade already
in there it's installed and it's solid
it's it's actually um um there you can't
really remove it so um
to install different blade all it does
is let me show you first what you have
to do there is a a thickness adjustment
right here you have to put on the
thickest one which is
5/16 and um this part goes down down
it's actually adjusting the thickness of
of the cut and you put two fingers in
here and just pull it so if you want
these blades installed you do same thing
you just put your two fingers in here
and just drop it in there when you drop
it in here this blade actually covers uh
this base overrides the flat blade and
these blades now Ina they're active
right now but this one is covered so uh
it's just there but it doesn't really
cut your veggies these are overriding so
um let's put it back the actual
base so first we're going to use the
flat blade and it does come with this
little safety guard um you
just all you have to do just put in here
and push it and all it does uh is
basically saves um you know it's a
little safety uh precau so you don't cut
your finger
um this uh food holder or however you
call it um it has a front and back and
it says on it over here it says back
over here it says front so this side is
front so you got to make sure it says
front and point in this direction so
every time you're going to slice this
safety guard going to actually re
release and let you go through like
that uh I personally think this is a
I
mean I don't think it's that effective
but again it's just my opinion that's
what I think um thickness like I said um
to remove this it has to be on
the on this five 16 so we're going to
adjust uh um little bit
thinner and just use it uh this whole
base is made uh out of plastic and it
looks like it's it's pretty uh durable
plastic I mean kitchen a makes pretty
good products has a nice grip here with
the rubber you can hold it like this or
like that it does have this little uh
like a shock absorber uh so don't don't
be scared that it will break I think
it's made on purpose I mean even if you
I move this it still does that I think
it's just uh helps you to push it and um
it's made for that so don't be scared
that it's breaking or it should not be
like that so anyway um
one thing
guys I did read instruction this time I
did so
um they say you have to use this you
never never use your hand I mean of
course you know you going to slice it
and you might slice your finger so
that's why this is like a guard for your
fingers but um again don't do this at
home it's I'm doing just
because I like to take a risk not really
but anyway this is a a cucumber and if
you hold it for from here and won't let
it come close to your fingers you'll be
fine but don't do it just me doing it so
um I'm holding this down like that this
is the first time I'm going to slice it
I never done this before and see how it
works so uh let's do
it
o okay so I'm not going to do too much
so I don't risk uh cutting my fingers uh
and this is the thickness I used very
simple uh it's not shaky it's pretty
sturdy again far as I have experienced
kitchen a makes really uh good quality
products also you could use the
handguard once the Cucumber gets smaller
of course that's um that's pretty
obvious yeah if this cucumber gets
smaller and smaller don't take a risk
use this put this in here and when it's
a smaller just use the guard mhm but
when it's this long uh again I don't
think
it's that risky it just you know when
you push it this cucumber might crack
and your finger might goes in there so
don't do it I'm just doing for my own
risk demonstration
purpose and let's try let's try to do a
little bit little bit thicker see how it
works and again these this is the most
thinnest one and most thickest one is
this so let's do a little bit
thicker
okay thicker
one that's enough I think that's too
thick so um these are thicker so it's
pretty good uh blades are pretty sharp
uh it goes very smooth I'm not really
applying too much pressure uh literally
I mean if you watch me
like it's pretty sharp again so far I
like it so this blade PL that's what it
does it cuts um um that slices let's
slice Apple too let's see how Apple
Works obviously
Apple obviously Apple I'm not going to
use my hands I'm going to use this guard
because it's pretty short and again I
like my fingers so this part it goes up
and down uh these little uh they're like
needles you can actually insert Apple in
here
it's pretty solid again front goes this
way and now we completely safe with the
fingers um I'm not going to use this
it's on the way again that's what I do
you don't do that I don't recommend so
see
that's
it see how it
looks this is pretty cool as you can see
for apple pie and again blades are
pretty sharp works pretty
good okay so this is this blade again if
you want to remove this it will not come
out until you put this on the thickest
position it releases some stuff so it
comes out in here we going to try this
one um two fingers put in here okay um
yeah let's put these all of them in one
bowl
sure give it to the kids to
eat let's do this we're going to do
carrot again I'm not going to use this
because it's too long and when I get
closer we'll see so let's do it
pretty
good let's I don't like this
okay you don't have to apply too much
pressure
this is not a proper way again I'm going
to repeat this many times I want to make
sure you guys don't cut your fingers you
have to use this uh how to use this with
this tiny pieces usually you just make
it smaller piece let's cut
it and over here you can just insert
this in here like that
and that's how you do
it pretty
good so this thing the reason it goes up
and down because when you um put this in
here and you got to push
it and it it's actually goes in spot and
now applying a little pressure in here
you
can do like that
yeah it's all right yeah okay we're done
with carrots now let's try make
some french fries okay so same thing you
got to put on the thickest remove
this these
blades I forgot how you call them but
anyway they sticking out it's very easy
to cut the finger that's why they come
with this guard so when you install this
there's no fingers to put in you got to
install it with this plastic on because
these blades are sharp so on the
thickest you just drop this in here
actually before you drop it or
[Music]
some some carrots is okay if I mix with
them okay
so so you drop this right in
here just like that there's no clicking
noise or nothing it just there so now
you can remove it and the way you remove
this you got to pull it up and then it
comes out has this little um little
teeth that goes in here and locks it so
so to remove this blade you can actually
pull it with this plastic and it comes
out so this is your handle to install it
and uninstall
it
okay now we're ready to do some french
fries
okay I cut this potato to fit in this
you don't have to cut it it just if you
don't cut it and if it doesn't fit it's
going to stay so high and it's going to
be unstable uh for this thing to be
stable it has to be in inside of these
rails like a train so um if this one is
wider and you don't cut it to adjust to
this hole it's going to actually stick
out and you're going to have to kind of
balance it yourself
okay so since we cut this we're going to
put this in
here like that and make it french fries
ready okay let's
see that's actually pretty good yeah
that's very nice I would eat some french
fries right now no me too okay let's do
another one so again I'm going to show
you when you don't adjust your potato
and you just put oh this one it actually
fits never mind
okay ready set
go that's
it that was very quick yeah okay and the
last one we're going to do how you call
this thing zucchini zucchini zucchini
we're going to use different
blades to remove
this you put this one in here just like
that push it in and remove
it take this
one how could you tell them drop it in
here just drop it in
here it's nice and solid pull this B
okay okay the zucchini you can't really
do like this because um this thing is
going to be unstable and it's you know I
mean you can do
it you can do it but um it's not
recommended and it's not it's completely
on your own risk
I don't know what I just did it
worked and this is a zucchini
neurals looks nice okay guys that's
about it um it's pretty simple to use uh
these these Plastics they're all
dishwasher safe and these cups I mean
these bowls is actually uh they they
they're so nice to write over here this
is a two Cup this is a one cup this is a
a three cup um where's the fourth one
okay and this is the four cup obviously
so it's pretty nice of you know kitchen
a to indicate that um again uh it looks
like pretty
solid uh have nice container um you can
store these in here nicely just cover
them and put
them um that's about it guys okay guys
