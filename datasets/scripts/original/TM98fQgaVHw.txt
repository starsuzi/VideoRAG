Wish you had fresh cookies waiting for you after work?
Well, today is your day.
We're going to make dashboard cookies.
Throw them into the car in the afternoon,
and they'll be ready for your commute back home.
It's over 95 out here.
It's already over 150 in the car.
Now we just need to sit back, be patient and wait.
It's been about two hours and now we're back to see
how the cookies are...
ow!
It's hot as an oven in there.
Let's hope that the cookies are done.
Alright, well let's see what we got here.
That's definitely hot.
It's about 150 degrees right now.
So, let's take a look and see.
Scientifically speaking, we've proven that we can
take this Subaru Impreza WRX
and turn it into an all purpose convection oven
capable of cooking up an entire tray of cookies.
