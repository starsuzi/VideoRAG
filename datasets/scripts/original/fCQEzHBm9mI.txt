hey everyone i am doing a do it yourself
today on how to turn your empty candle
jars into storage containers for your
makeup or for anything um
that you would like to put into them i
have five candle jars and i am doing two
of them on the bath and body works
candles which are these ones right here
then i got these two at walmart i liked
the design of the jar itself i could
definitely see myself for using these so
i had purchased these
and i have this glass cup that doesn't
have a
lid to it but i could use these for like
eyeliners or to put smaller makeup
brushes in alright let's get started
these four jars had the
candle label on them these two actually
peeled off really easily
and
these two um
i had already peeled this one off but i
left this one on for you guys and this
one peels off easily as well
and we're just gonna go and start off by
peeling this
and as you can see it just comes right
off if you have a label that is harder
to peel off i suggest just to leave it
on
and later on we could peel that off when
we get to that step
so i'm going to start by taking all the
lids off
of the of the jars
this is going to require you to have
um boiling water
so i'm just using my electric kettle and
i had already boiled the water and i'm
going to pour the boiling water into all
these jars
you could fill it up to the top that
would probably be best to get the wax
out
once you have all them filled you're
going to start noticing the hot water is
doing is it's going to start melting all
the wax and you're going to be able to
see
the wax rise
and separate from the bottom so what i
like to do to speed up the process a
little bit is i like to take a fork or
some type of like civil war and stick it
in
to the candle
wax and kind of get it to separate a
little bit quicker
and as you can see right there that
automatically lifts
the melted wax
straight up from
the bottom
and then the piece where the wick is you
can just
scrape it and get that piece
separated from the glue as well
i'm just going to take some napkins and
i'm going to pull apart
the wax that hasn't melted yet
so it's less to deal with
okay
be very careful because it's really hot
that one was easy
so
and here's some of the remaining wax and
candle wicks and i'm just going to trash
this so we have all of the wax
separated from the bottom of the jar we
can do either
one of two things if you have time and
you're not in a rush to get these jars
you know put into good use you can let
them sit and wait for the water to
actually cool all the way down and once
the water cools all the way down it's
actually going to make the wax that is
floated to the top harden then you're
able to remove the hard wax from the jar
but if you are more in a rush and you
want to be able to use your jars as soon
as possible
what i like to do is i just like to take
some paper towels and i uh
and i like to dip them inside the wax
and that's going to collect
the wax
that's inside of the jar
and then just trash them
it's kind of nice because you can
actually still smell the melted wax
from
each of the candle scents
if you get wax on the counters or the
area that you're working on
i it's probably best to wipe it up as
soon as possible you're able to easily
wipe up the
melted wax instead of taking a spoon or
a butter knife
and having to scrape it off if you had
trouble peeling off a candle label then
this is where
you can peel them off now since the
boiling water has been sitting in this
jar it was able to heat up the whole jar
obviously it's also given it time to
warm up the label that is on the candle
and that makes the adhesive on the
sticker
loosen and it will help you peel the
sticker off the jar easier
and on this bath and body workstar i
also i actually have a sticker on the
bottom so i will demonstrate that and
show you that it is a lot easier to now
peel off the
sticker on the jar
as you can see right here
and then it is peeling
right off
and
sometimes you're left with some of the
adhesive from the sticker on the jar but
that's totally fine because you're able
to clean that up later
all right now that all of the wax is
removed from all of the jars and i'm
going to clean my jars by taking this
brillo pad right here and just scrub
them all out and i'm going to scrub the
the top of the jars as well
now that they all are
cleaned out we are able to
reuse them
and you can put just about anything in
these jars pretty much whatever you
prefer it's a
ideal way of just organizing your desk
and your makeup area i just have a
couple of examples and i've been holding
my makeup sponges in a plastic bag like
this and now that i have these jars i'm
able just to
stuff them in there
and
and i can put it in a respected area on
my makeup desk or if i don't want to use
a slit i just want to use this as a
makeup brush holder
i am able to do that i have these
these little
um decorative beadings that i can just
stick in here
to help hold up my makeup brushes now i
am able to
reuse this as a makeup brush holder
and then for something small like this i
can just take
my eyeliners lip liners
and liquid eyeliner pencils and stuff
and i'm just able to just place them in
the container like so concludes my
