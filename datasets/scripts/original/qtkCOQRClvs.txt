LOOK AT THIS.
MY GOD.
THIS IS AN AMERICAN BISON.
TODAY, I BROUGHT MY SON BUDDY
TO THE NEW JERSEY STATE MUSEUM
TO SEE SOME OF THE EXHIBITS.
THAT'S A T. REX?
THAT'S A T. REX.
INVITATIONS ARE DONE.
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE.
I GET A CALL FROM THE CURATOR OF
THE MUSEUM,
AND, COINCIDENTALLY,
THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
LAST MINUTE,
THEY NEED A WEDDING CAKE.
HI.
HOW YOU DOING? I'M BUDDY.
JASON.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
THIS IS MY SON BUDDY.
HEY, BUDDY, HOW'S IT GOING?
NICE TO MEET YOU.
SO, WE'RE THINKING OF A REALLY
TRADITIONAL WEDDING CAKE, RIGHT?
WHATEVER SHE WANTS.
BIG AND FANCY.
SO, WHERE ARE YOU GUYS HAVING
THE WEDDING?
HERE AT THE MUSEUM.
THEY CAN'T EVEN GET YOU OUT
TO GO TO A HALL?
YOU GOT TO BE HERE?
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S WHATEVER MAKES HER HAPPY.
AH, GOOD MAN.
GOOD ANSWER.
IT WAS A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU.
-THANK YOU.
-SAY THANK YOU, BUDDY.
-BYE, BUD.
-BYE, BUDDY, NICE TO MEET YOU.
SEE YOU LATER.
PRETTY SIMPLE.
THEY WANT AN OLD-SCHOOL,
TRADITIONAL CAKE.
AAH!
BUT AS I'M WALKING OUT,
THIS BRIDE COMES RUNNING UP
TO CHANGE HER REQUEST.
BUDDY,
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.
YEAH, WHAT'S UP?
I KNOW THAT WE SAID
THAT JASON IS TOTALLY OKAY
WITH DOING ALL FANCY
AND FRILLY FOR ME,
BUT I THINK
WE SHOULD SURPRISE HIM.
MAYBE IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING
WITH THE DRYPTOSAURUS --
THE NEW JERSEY DINOSAUR.
SHE WANTS A DINOSAUR CAKE,
AND I'M THINKING,
"THAT'S PRETTY COOL.
I MEAN, WE SHOULD GO ALL OUT."
IT'S A FIRST.
[ Laughing ] IT'S A FIRST?
IT'S AN ORIGINAL. I NEVER MADE
A DINOSAUR WEDDING CAKE.
AND DON'T FORGET,
IT'S A SURPRISE.
MY LIPS ARE SEALED.
OKAY, GREAT.
THANK YOU.
Buddy:
I'M THINKING THIS DINOSAUR CAKE
IS GONNA BE ABOUT 6 FEET
TALL.
WE'RE GONNA BUILD A STRUCTURE
OUT OF WOOD AND METAL
AND SCULPT HIS HEAD
OUT OF RICE KRISPIE TREATS.
THEN, WE'LL FILL HIS BODY
WITH POUND CAKE
AND COVER IT WITH
BROWN FONDANT,
AND WE'LL GIVE HIM SOME CLAWS
AND SOME SCARY TEETH.
[ GROWLS ]
Ralph:
THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT.
SEE, THIS IS WHERE
I WANTED TO PUT THE PIPE --
IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.
I'D SAY I HAVE MORE KNOWLEDGE
OF DINOSAURS
THAN YOUR AVERAGE 26-YEAR-OLD
AND SLIGHTLY LESS
THAN YOUR AVERAGE 6-YEAR-OLD.
♪♪
THIS ISN'T EVEN CLOSE
TO THE WEIRDEST WEDDING CAKE
THAT WE'VE DONE.
I'M HAVING A LOT OF FUN
MAKING THIS DINOSAUR SO FAR.
[ Lisping ]
DUH, LOOK AT MY GUMS.
I'M A DINOSAUR.
I COULD GUM YOU TO DEATH.
WHOA.
[ Normal voice ] WHEN BUDDY
FIRST SAID THAT WE WERE
GONNA DO A DINOSAUR CAKE,
KIND OF GOT MY LITTLE KID ON.
I WAS THAT GUY
THAT NEVER GREW OUT
OF LIKING DINOSAURS
WHEN HE WAS LITTLE.
THIS IS LOOKING
KIND OF DINOSAUR-Y NOW, HUH?
YEAH.
YEAH, HE'S GETTING THERE.
DO YOU WANT ME
TO CARRY IT?
I GOT IT.
YOU SURE?
I'D FEEL BETTER.
OKAY.
♪♪
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME
THAT THIS DINOSAUR LOOK
AS AUTHENTIC
AS WE CAN MAKE IT.
I'M GONNA PUT
ONE OF THESE HERE
AND THEN START
SWINGING HIM DOWNWARDS.
-ALL RIGHT.
-COOL?
I LIKE IT.
♪♪
WE'RE GONNA START COVERING
THE BOTTOM OF THE LEGS
AND THE ARMS AND THE HEAD.
IS THIS IS A BIRD,
LEGALLY?
IT'S A REPTILE.
IT'S A WHAT?
IT'S A REPTILE.
A RECTANGLE?
REPTILE, LIKE A SNAKE
OR A TURTLE OR A CROCODILE.
-IT'S A CROCODILE?
-IT'S A REPTILE!
HELLO.
-BRING YOUR END DOWN.
-ALL RIGHT, DOWN.
AND I'M GONNA BRING
THE WHOLE THING LONGWAYS
OVER THE TOP,
OKAY?
NOW, MY BEASTIE...
NOW WE CAN ALL SEE
YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE.
I LIKE THESE LITTLE WRINKLES
IN HIS NECK.
IT MAKES HIM LOOK --
ANCIENT.
YEAH, LIZARD-Y.
OH, THIS IS STARTING
TO LOOK REALLY COOL.
OKAY, NOW YOU GRAB THAT CORNER.
MORE, MORE, MORE,
MORE, MORE.
OKAY, RIGHT THERE.
Ralph:
IT'S LOOKING GOOD.
AAH!
I'M GONNA SCALE
A LITTLE BIT MORE OVER HERE.
WE SHOULD TAKE THESE TOOLS
AND JUST TRY TO FOLLOW
THE LINE THROUGHOUT.
-WE'RE GONNA DO ALL OF THAT?
-YES, WE ARE.

WE'RE ALMOST HOME.
LESS MAT, MORE SCALES.

Buddy: WE GET
ALL THE FINISHING TOUCHES,
AND I MEAN,
THIS THING IS LOOKING REAL.
LET'S CUT OUT SOME GREEN LEAVES.
DROP IT.
IT LOOKS 250 TIMES BETTER.
SO, GUYS, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
-AWESOME.
-OH, YEAH.
THIS IS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE COOLEST CAKES.

WAIT. WAIT.
IS THAT A CAKE?

THAT'S OUR WEDDING CAKE.
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S AMAZING.
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.

[ Chuckling ] HEY!
SURPRISE, HUH?
IT'S AMAZING.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
SO, HERE'S THE DEAL.
I KNOW THAT WE PLANNED
ON A BIG, FRILLY CAKE,
BUT YOUR FIANCéE CAME BACK,
AND SHE WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU
WITH THIS GREAT DINOSAUR CAKE
'CAUSE IT'S YOUR FAVORITE,
WE HEARD.
YEP.
AND IT'S OUR FAVORITE
BECAUSE IT'S THE NEW JERSEY
DINOSAUR, RIGHT?
YEAH!
[ APPLAUSE ]
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S HOME
HERE IN THIS MUSEUM.
YEAH.
I'D LOVE FOR HIM TO STAY,
BUT I'D RATHER EAT HIM.
ALL RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S TOO PERFECT.
YOU GOT TO DO IT.
JUST DO IT. STAB IT.
REALLY?
DO IT! DO IT!

I HAD NO IDEA
IT WAS A CAKE, AT FIRST.
IT COMPLETELY
BLEW ME AWAY.
THIS IS TRULY WHO WE ARE.
IT'S TOTALLY NONTRADITIONAL.
I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT.
THIS IS JUST PERFECT.
IT'S PERFECT.
Buddy:
THIS WAS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE STRANGER
WEDDING CAKES I'VE EVER DONE,
BUT THE NEWLYWEDS SEEMED HAPPY.

LET'S JUST SAY,
THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER
WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE EXTINCT.
