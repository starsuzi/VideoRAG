Now I'm going to show you proper usage and
storage of your ultimate mandoline. Here you
have your ultimate mandoline that has a slide
out bar for uses if you want to use it in
a upright which would also collapse underneath.
You have your storage box which slides off
and contains all of your 4 stainless steel
blades. The blades slide in and out for easy
use. Here you have your food holder. This
has a stainless steel prongs which you would
place your food cut into the proper place
into. This again would be placed into the
slide which simply slides up and down the
tracks. It is held in by its hooks which would
appear when you slide in your blade of choice.
You can simply slide everything off, slide
the blade out and in. This could either be
used in a upright position, over your counter
or cooking board or an enclose position over
your mixing batter bowl. It fits snuggly with
the grooves right underneath, fit right upon
the batter bowl and then you simply slide
back and forth. You slide straight into your
preparation bowl.
