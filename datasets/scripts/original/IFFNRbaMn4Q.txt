ok this morning we're going to make some
waffles really delicious waffles using
the rival to slice waffle maker i
purchased this at walmart very inexpensive
for less than ten dollars and
it works really great we're going to use
this buttermilk pancake mix it says here
you just add water but in the back
there's a recipe here for waffles so
we're going to combine the mix we're
going to add some water and two table
spoons vegetable oil the direction says
here that it should sit allow batter to
rest 4 to 5 minutes so we're going to go
ahead and do that the waffle maker will
heat up in about two-and-a-half minutes
so we'll start that in between because
this will need to sit 4 to 5 minutes
so I'm going to pause and then we're
going to go ahead and mix everything up
and then we'll get started
ok so we're going to go ahead and add
three-quarter cups of water
two tablespoons of vegetable oil and
then we're just going to whisk it and
we're going to get all the
lumps out of it and after we whisk it
will let this sit 4 to five minutes and
then the batter will get nice and thick
the waffle iron takes about two and a
half minutes so in between that
i'll turn the waffle iron on
then we'll have some great waffles in a short
amount of time
ok our waffle iron is ready the red
light indicates that the powers on the
green light indicates that it is
preheated this has been sitting for
about four minutes so we're going to go
ahead and get started we're going to
open it up and i'm going to go ahead and
just pray some nonstick likely on both
sides and i'm going to get my ladle here
and pour some in
you can hear it sizzling the waffle iron
is nice and hot
okay just close it has a little latch
here the green light went off and it'll
turn back on when the waffles are ready
and that takes about two and a half
minutes so I'm going to pause this for a
second and then i'll open it up when
it's ready
okay the green light has come on and
that's indicating that the waffles are
complete
they're done and it smells so good so
we're going to open it up and using this
wooden spoon because we don't want to
damage the surface of the waffle maker
want to take out our waffles, it smells so good
and put some butter on here and
then we're going to pour some syrup over
delicious
here that little crunch and I love
that crunch yum these are really delicious
delicious easy to make
this instruction book here has a basic
waffle recipe but i didn't have all
these ingredients so i went ahead and
just purchased this little packet here
buttermilk pancake mix that has
instructions on how to make waffles in
the back and I bought two these for 98 cents
so that was a good deal and these
waffles taste as good or better than
that recipe that the manuals provided i
