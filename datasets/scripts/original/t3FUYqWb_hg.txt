try it out in a bit I'm gonna meet one
waffle and oh it's locked as it may
catch spin okay it rotates
so gonna test to make a waffle in a bit
I cannot wait I'm excited
good morning so today we're gonna test
out the waffle maker that I unboxed
yesterday so what you do is you need to
wipe the insides with a damp cloth okay
wipe it maybe a few times until it's
clean can wipe the outside also if you
want to then you put the plates
underneath you plug it in turn it on
okay you can already set the dial to the
desired waffle Chris penis it has light
so this is media and dark I have my
batter I made early this morning this is
a standard Belgian waffle mix or yeast
waffle better as I said the insides are
nonstick but I still like to wipe on
some butter so it doesn't stick and it
gives a nice effect to the waffle and
some flavor the outside of the waffle so
then you make for the waffle iron to
heat up and we can put in waffle mix
okay so the green light is off now and
only the red light is on we are going to
put in the waffle batter I don't know
that's it and turn and wait okay
the green light is on so he's ready I
wonder how it looks like okay and we're
gonna open the lid Wow yeah I set it to
dark so it's dark you're gonna take a
plate use a plastic tongue or a silicon
Tonya to get the waffle out stop
okay this is the front part perfect
crispy Belgian waffles beautiful
