So I've been remodeling this old bathroom
And I've just been dumping a ton of money into this house, so I wanted to find a cheaper way to
replace this ugly sink color
That would have ...cause the sink works fine, it's just ugly so what I bought was I bought this hommax
tough as tile
Epoxy paint kit and you're supposed to be able to paint the tile the porcelain and it gives it a new color
And then I'm gonna do some other things in here and paint the counter and
What not, but I figured I'd give this a try first
And I've never ever used this before so I'm gonna give you guys an honest play-by-play. How it goes and you
Guys, can see how it works
I bought a respirator, and I guess we'll get started
So when you first open up the kit you get?
Two cans of spray paint tubs, sinks, tile..
One carton finish so these are the finished cans in the Box you get steel wool and
Leather er, rubber gloves some instructions, it's like a cleaning packet for the solution
I think
That's about it, okay, so
You get the two cans of paint
You get the instructions the packet for making the cleaner steel wool and some latex, gloves
So what it told me to do first was to get the steel wool that it came with and
really clean out
the sink and scrub
Every inch of it
because the finish is dependent on how clean the sink is so you really just want to get in here use your
elbow grease and just get every imperfection
off
So that's what I'm doing
now I'm gonna add this to a gallon of water warm water, and I'm gonna clean the
sink again
So now I've got a sponge like it says and I'm just gonna wipe down the entire area
again really thoroughly
This is another cleaning just I think you're just getting the dust off and I think it's a degreaser more than anything
We'll just wipe the whole sink down
And then and then it says to repeat the process again, so we'll go back over it with steel wool. This is the
Second time. I'm gonna do this a total of three times
so
Three steel wools, three cleaning three
With the cleansers and three drying with isopropyl
Alcohol, and then we'll put the first coat of paint on
So I'm not going to show you all that, but just know that you've got to do the cleaning and the scouring three times
so now
I've taped up all the areas that I don't want to have any spray over even though. I'm gonna refinish
This counter I figured it would be better just to prep everything and this is loose so that I can get underneath it
I would take this off normally, but I'm kind of a time crunch
So we're gonna try this and if I have to remove it I will
Apparently the fumes can be pretty bad for the spray paint so I picked up a respirator
So I don't have to breathe em. I don't want to breathe them, so I'm gonna put this on
All right, so I've got this all done
This was two coats it's still curing it says 48 hours, but it's touchable the only mistake
I made is I actually had a fragment drop off the ceiling and I tried to wipe it out and that caused some ridges and
Other than the finish is just slightly annoyed it. It really didn't affect it. I can see it
I doubt the average person will even care
So it's really important to make sure that your surface area and the surrounding area
Nothing can go wrong because I caused my own problem
But the product worked really well the only complaint that I have is the smell that came off this product
was pretty substantial and
You need to make sure that the area is well ventilated and it takes about
Just the sink
I wasn't able to stay at my house for about six seven hours with all the windows open and all the fans going it's
the fumes that come off this epoxy are pretty impressive, so
If you're looking for a cheap way to redo a sink this works. I'm impressed. I'll probably use it on future products
I'm gonna try it on a shower enclosure next I'll probably make a video or an update of that so uh
Anyway, I?
give it a thumbs up and just know that you're going to need a respirator and
That you're gonna need time to let it vent out and like I said
Prep is everything if the more time you spend prepping it the less problems
You'll have spraying it so anyway, please subscribe to the channel be more stuff coming up as I get this house ready for sale
