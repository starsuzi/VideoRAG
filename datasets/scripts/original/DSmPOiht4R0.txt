hey folks Philly boy Jay here back with
another recipe and today I'm going to
show you guys how I cook my stove top
pigs feet what I'm going to do first is
place my frozen pigs feet in a bowl of
salt water once they Tha out I'm going
to wash and rinse them the vegetables
I'm going to use are green butell
peppers red bell peppers onions and
celery I'm also going to use some butter
and minced
garlic I'm going to use quite a few
seasonings the seasonings I'm using are
salt onion powder Italian seasoning
parsley flakes paika black pepper and
crushed red peppers I'm going to add the
crushed red peppers to the pigs feet
once they're all
done here I have about a quart of water
I'm going to add some apple cider
vinegar and
some woer W shy
sauce guys I can't pronounce that I'm
just going to call it w sauce I'm going
to add some apple cider vinegar and W
sauce to the quart of
water then I'm going to stir in some
corn starch this is what they call a
sluy and the sluy is going to create a
thin gravy for the pigs feet so stir the
cornstarch and really well until it's
well
dissolved then you're going to get a big
pop and move over to the
stove you're going to add your fresh
clean pig's feet to the pot they may be
feets but they fresh and so clean clean
they fresh and so clean
[Music]
clean so add the fresh and clean pigs
feet to the
[Applause]
pot then add the chopped
vegetables the onions the celery the
green bell peppers and the red bell
peppers then you're going to add the
minced
garlic guys I love to use minced garlic
and pigs
feet I just think minced garlic gives
pigs feet such a great flavor
you got to add that minced
garlic what you don't got to add is the
butter that is optional and it's not
really necessary I just use it because
my grandom always used it in her pig's
feet and I do what she
do then you're going to add the
seasonings and you can just look at the
seasonings and tell that the pig's feet
are going to be so
flavorful now I'm going to pour in the
slurry that's going to create a thin
gravy for the pig's feet as I said and
don't worry the gravy is not going to be
thick it's going to be really
thin after adding the slurry you're
going to add some additional
water just regular water
[Music]
[Applause]
I'm going to cook the pigs feet for 3
and 1 12 to 4 hours over medium
heat cover the pig's feet with a lid
make sure that you leave a crack on the
side so that the liquid doesn't
overflow and you're just going to let
them go let them simmer and cook for 3
and 1/2 2 4 hours and look at those pigs
Fe
look at how tender they
are just look at how tender they are

Below in the video description box there
you'll find the exact
measurements cooking time detailed
instructions and any additional
information you need to know
regarding this recipe and you can see
there the gravy is thin it's not very
thick now the crush red
peppers that's
optional all right they are optional you
do not have to use Crush red peppers I'm
also going to use some hot
sauce so I'm adding the hot sauce
now and I use crushed red peppers and
hot sauce because me and my family we
like our pigs feet a little spicy not
too spicy but we like to add a little
spiciness to the pigs feet so if you
want to follow my recipe to a t make
sure you add the crushed red peppers and
the hot sauce stir the crushed red
peppers and the hot sauce in really well
and that's pretty much
it lay the smackdown on these pigs
feet now pigs feet are mostly
fat and bones but as you can see there's
some meat there and the meat is nice and
