How to Yo-Yo.
Follow these steps and you will be spinning
tricks in no time at all.
You will need A yo-yo and a hand.
Step 1.
Unravel the yo-yo, so it rests on the floor.
The string should reach your belly button.
If it's too long, cut it where it meets the
bottom of your chest when the yo-yo is resting
on the floor.
Step 2.
Tie a loop at the end of the string, so that
the string is the proper length.
Step 3.
Hold the yo-yo with your left hand, your index
finger over the slot in the yo-yo.
Wind the string one time around both the yo-yo
and your finger.
Then remove your finger and wind the rest
of the string around the yo-yo.
Step 4.
Place the loop on your middle finger, between
your first and second knuckles.
Use your dominant hand to yo-yo, which will
give you more control.
Step 5.
Hold the yo-yo in your hand, palm up, so that
the string goes from your finger over the
top to the yo-yo.
Step 6.
Throw the yo-yo forward and downward, opening
with your hand open wide and facing your palm
outward.
Step 7.
Turn your hand over so that your palm is facing
the floor and sharply tug the string the second
the sting is fully extended.
Step 8.
Catch the yo-yo in the palm of your hand,
turn it over and repeat.
You are now successfully yo-yoing.
Keep practicing!
