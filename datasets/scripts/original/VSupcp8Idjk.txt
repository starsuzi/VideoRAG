hey guys scotty here at one restaurant
in lounge in new orleans again
another tip on tomatoes is coring your
tomatoes before you use them and gets
rid of this little note end
on the uh from where the vine came down
invest in a good tornado knife they call
these a tourney knife also a bird beak
peeler you might hear
very simple you're just going to find
your note in get yourself a good grasp
on the tomato
insert your knife like so and then you
basically just guide it
guide it around you'll notice that my
knife never moves
all of the motion is in the tomato
you're merely turning the tomato you're
keeping a firm grass here
on the knife and just turn your tomato
around
and then that way the core will come
right out and you've got everything else
left in there is edible
