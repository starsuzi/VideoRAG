lamb chops let's get straight on with
these as you you see I've got I've got
about 10 pieces in there nice little
lamp chops nice bit of meat on them nice
little bit of fat still on there not all
the fats have been taken off I want some
fat so we're going to start with a
little bit of color this is an orange
color even though it looks very red just
a food color there a powder you can get
it in a liquid form if you want here
I've got garlic and ginger mix
50/50 let's go in with a little bit of
salt
it's
good and then here I've got some powders
equal parts
[Music]
of
cumin chili
coriander and turmeric or howy like a
teaspoon each or if you like is your
favorite curry powder
mix some fresh green
chili which I really
love little bit of oil
and then we're just going to give this a
little mix
around I don't really want to use my
hands because of that food
color if
you use
it the food color like this it's better
you wear gloves or don't touch it cuz it
really can stain you for some time okay
we need to
now get some shrink wrap or cling film
on that put that in the fridge for at
least 2 hours overnight would be
fantastic and then we can cook them I'll
see you
then okay here we go there's our
beautiful lamp chops that have been in
that marination for some time now as you
can see here I've got a dry Skillet
there's nothing on it just a flat
surface if you don't have one of these
Skillet type things you can just use the
frying pan simply we're going to lay
these on
[Music]
that color we put on is going to give it
a real kind
of tandor
look of course we're not using a Tandoor
to
cookly I'm presume like me you don't
have
one yeah this is fantastic you can do
this on the your barbecue if you want
they give them a nice charcoal flavor
wow all right I'm just going to cook
these for like probably going to be
about 6 minutes I'm going to keep
flipping them over here and there very
simple see you when they're
[Music]
done okay here we go these are done now
I've been turning them over and over a
few
times I mean these are just so juicy
they're going to be
fantastic I hope you like these cuz I
really do like I said you can do them in
your bar on your barbecue in the garden
or at home on one of these in your
kitchen if you don't have a barbecue or
a garden that maybe the case okay what
I'm going to do now these are completely
done they're ready to eat I'm just going
to show you one other thing that I'm
going to serve with these which is just
a very quick little yogurt thing let's
go and do
that okay as you can see here I've got a
little bit of plain yogurt little bit of
chopped onion
a little bit of fresh coriander just
just add a little touch of
salt give that a
mix and this is going to just be so
super and if you wanted you could add
some cucumber to
this but that is going to be really
beautiful fairly cooling as well with
those spicy
chops that's it hope you enjoy it see
