hey fabulous diyers in this episode of
redesign your clothes I'm going to show
you how you can take your old party
dress and turn it into a fabulous
evening gown so let's
[Music]
begin 6 yards of tool I'm using stretch
tool because my dress is a stretch knit
dress and it's 54 in wide two yards of
stretch knit lining if your dress does
not stretch then you can use the regular
lining that's non-stretch make sure that
the fabric is very wide because you're
going to be needing it for gathers
embellishment of your choice matching
needle and thread measuring tape and
scissors and lastly push
[Music]
pens first you want to cut off the Hem
of the dress I already pre-cut minds and
then you want to fold the dress in half
seam to seam and at the front part of
the dress you're going to cut up 1 in
from the side seam to the
front it will look like a high low hem
once you're
complete then put your dress on to
measure how long down to the floor you
want your tool skirt bottom to
be
with your six yards of tool fabric
you're going to fold it in half and fold
it in half again the long way this might
be tricky since you have a lot of
tool with the skirt hem measurement
you're going to measure down along the
tool and then cut across you want to
repeat this process for all six pieces
you should have six
[Music]
pieces
four pieces of tool from the sixth piece
and separate them into two sets of two
pieces of tul then take one set of the
tool and sew the side edges together to
form a side seam on each end of the tool
repeat for the second
set with the last sets of tool layer
them one on top each other and then fold
them in half then cut it across you
should have four pieces
of tool you're going to stitch down the
sides edges to create a side
seam and this will be the top tier of
the skirt hem once all the tool is sewn
take each tool and insert it into each
other from short to Long pin it into
place and then you're going to top
Stitch a loose Stitch at the top of the
skirt to gather it
up
[Music]
repeat the whole process again for the
lining but instead it's going to be only
two pieces this
[Music]
time once you have gathered the lining
and the tool skirt then you're going to
have to apply it onto the Hem of the
dress make sure that you ease it into
the seam of the Hem so you can nicely
distribute it evenly throughout the
skirt bottom if you don't have a lining
in your dress you can take the lining
Fabric and connect it along with the
tool to the Dress portion repeat the
process for the lining if you do have
[Music]
lining and once you have sewn everything
down it is time for you to put the
embellishment on the
neckline and when you're finished you
are ready to wear so here's the final
look and yes this is a giveaway I'm
