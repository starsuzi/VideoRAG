what you will
need the first thing you'll need is some
hamster
[Music]
food some flour that's safe for hamsters
water a bowl or mixing
dish a tablespoon and a teaspoon
next you'll be needing the wooden
internal chew stick which is basically
the wooden be after your hamsters
finished that
exposed just make sure that the green
clip can be removed so it doesn't melt
when put into the
oven first you'll be needing 2 tbspoon
of hamster food to 1 tblspoon of flour
make sure you take the pieces of the
food that you don't want into in your
chew stick such as meal worms as they
get quite soft when baked now you want
to mix up mix up your mixture with 2
tbspoon of water you may need to add
more water or flour as
required now you're going to want to
start mixing the mixture with your hands
instead of the spoon
now get the mixture and try and wrap it
around the stick make sure that you
don't make it too fat and not cover
around the whole length of the stick to
make things easier I break my mixture
into two pieces and then do one piece
and then once that's done do the other
piece
I didn't have enough mixture to cover
the entire chew stick so I'm just going
to make a bit more
I'm just using again two tablespoons of
hamster food to 1 tbspoon of flour
just make sure all the mixture is
compact around the chew stick so it
doesn't fall
off now put the chew stick into the
microwave for approximately 1 to 2
minutes just make sure you keep on
checking it so it doesn't
burn your Che stick is now ready for
your hster Tweet
