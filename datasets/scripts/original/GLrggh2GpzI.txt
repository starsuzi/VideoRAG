hi it's Jaime from Guildbrook Farm and I've
got a dirty bird
the past couple days we've had a lot of
torrential rain and a lot of mud and on top
of that my poor little silky Gary just
got pooped on and she is quite the mess
so we're going to give her a bath
let me show you some of the things we're
going to use dr. bronner's soap a pouring
mug for rinsing her off a hair dryer a
washcloth to towel dry soft spots and two
old towels before we go out and get her we're going
to set up in here so it'll make it
easier the first thing we're going to do
is going to lay a towel on the ground
this is where we're going to blow her
dry i'm going to hook up my hair dryer
so it's ready to go I'm gonna fill my
sink up with warm not hot not cold warm
water. A little bit of soap in the water
ok let's go get her. C'mon Gary. Come on ok
she actually doesn't look too bad. She picked most of it off
come on baby i'm dirty I'm a dirty girl (bird squaks) I think she just said that
she's not gonna like this very much
maybe she will like it
Alright Gary. Ya good girl.
this is the second time we've had to bathe
her because she got pooped on and you
can see and normally I would just spot
wash her but she's kind of a mess all over
so we might as well just give her the
full treatment
normally I have my partner with me my my
youngest daughter loves to help give
baths but she's not with me today so I'm
doing the solo
good girl, Gary
and try and work this poop out of her
fur it's kind of matted in there you're so dirty
now i'm using dr. bronner's but you can
also use baby shampoo or you can
use like a pet shampoo a real mild
pet shampoo and this is really matted in here
good girl honey you have all kinds of stuff
stuck in here
really yeah
ok
it's ok Gary
Gary do's
Let's do the pompador
I'm gonna be real careful about getting
soap in her eyes
she's like what are you doin back there what's
going on back there with my egg hole
Stuff's coming out
ok
time to wring out your chicken
now we're going to squeeze her a little
bit and she's not going to be 100
percent clean because I don't wanna I
don't want to mess with her too much but
i am going to blow dry really thoroughly
so you can see how dirty she was
and how dirty she still is but I got
most of the poop off all right now we
don't want to get chilled so I put it on
the ground and I'm going to wrap her up
and now now I'm going to towel her dry
and see that's why we have this washcloth here
to do like her head
you want to make sure you get her chest
real good
I'm just gently rubbing her
and now we're going to blow her dry just a
little section at a time
it's really important when you're
blowing her dry you don't blast with hot
air you want to alternate hot and cold
want me to do your front now?
I think she likes it
I think it might have been a little too warm, she's walking away
ok
bird potato chips
That's Gary spa day Do you feel better?
come on let's go outside okay guys so
that is the Gary silkie chicken spa day
we didn't get her a hundred percent
clean but I wasn't gonna spend too much
time on her and scrubbing off too much dirt as
you can tell from the sink she was a pretty
pretty dirty bird but we got pretty much all
the poop out of her and we got her blown
dry probably ninety percent of
the way and she'll floof out outside
did you like that Gary (bird squaks) I think she said
yes
If you like that kind of stuff like and
subscribe and we'll see you next time
just a quick update for all you fans out
there
sadly this is going to be our last video
on our little silky Gary she was taken
by a hawk this morning so we wanted to
still post this video because we loved
her so much
unfortunately when you go with a chicken
that looks like Gary that in an area
that we're in which is a very wooded
area a white small chicken
where's Hawks it's your kind of asking
for trouble on that one but we really
wanted to have her here and we did she
had a good life and she laid some really
good eggs so anyway
sadly our gary is gone but will we will
remember and thank you guys for watching
ok
