delicious and easy to make to get
started I'll
need 1 and 1/4 cups of
meal 3/4 cups of
flour 1/4 cup of sugar 1 teaspoon of
baking powder 2 TB spoons of butter 1
and 1/2 cups of hot water and 1 cup of
oil for frying we'll also need one
medium mixing bowl and one large
Skillet okay we're ready to get started
now we have our oil preheating in our
Skillet under a medium high heat so
we're going to mix our
meal our
[Music]
flour
our
sugar and baking
[Music]
powder mix them
together so it's well mixed so that the
flour and the meal and the baking powder
are Incorporated
together after it looks like you have a
good mix we're going to add our butter
don't worry about it being melted
because the hot water is going to melt
it we're going to add our boiling hot
water and we're going to mix it
well now as you can see the butter is
melting this mixture is very hot so make
sure you don't get your fingers stuck in
there
okay as you can see it's well mixed and
this is the consistency it should be at
and now we're ready to add it to our hot
oil you know it's good and ready when it
IT sizzles when you put it in your
pan you can make your Spoonful as big or
as small as you
like this mixture makes about eight
large pieces of corn
bread okay we're going to let it brown
to a golden brown on each
side okay just checking to make sure
that they're golden brown and they are
so we're just going to give them a
little
flip watch your
fingers get a little
hot
and nice and golden
brown okay they should be ready in
about 3 more minutes and then we'll be
ready to Plate them on our paper towel
so they can drain and then join with
your delicious
meal okay these are ready to be
removed we're going to Plate
them
[Music]
okay okay they're nice and golden brown
and you can serve them with any meal
they're good with beans and another good
dish they're good with is okra corn and
tomatoes which we'll show you at a later
