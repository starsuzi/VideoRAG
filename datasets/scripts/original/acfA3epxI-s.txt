Hi everybody!
This is Jeff of HomeRepairTutor.com, and today
I'm going to share with you two things that
drive me insane in the shower.
One of them is soap scum, and the second thing
is constantly having to clean it.
So what I'm going to do is clean this off
using a formula that I found online that you
can pretty much find anywhere, and that is
using baking soda and vinegar.
So baking soda and vinegar, when you put them
together, they create a chemical reaction,
and the acidity of that will cut through the
soap scum.
But you have to make a paste—so I made a
paste like this—and what you're going to
do after you make that paste is wipe it all
over your glass and leave it sit there for
10-15 minutes, and then you're going to wipe
it back off.
And then, the next part that I'm going to
use which you don't commonly see in the shower,
but you see it more for automotive purposes,
is Rain-X.
So Rain-X is a product that you put on your
windshield, and it causes water to beat up
and just drip off the surface.
So I'm going to show you how to use both of
these items to prevent soap scum and maybe
make your life a lot easier.
Okay, so the first step that I'm going to
take is applying the baking soda and vinegar
concoction together and putting it onto the
actual glass on the shower door.
So I made my concoction a little bit—how
do I describe this?—it's, as you can see,
it's got liquidity to it.
It's somewhat of a liquid, but it's mostly
a paste.
And I wanted it to be pasty because I'm going
to use a sponge to wipe it onto this glass.
So that's what I'm going to do now.
And then, once I get it on the glass, I'm
going to leave it sit for probably 10 or 15
minutes so that the baking soda and vinegar
will cut through the soap scum itself.
So let's go ahead and do that so you have
a good idea of what you'll be working with.
So you can see here, I'm just putting the
actual 
baking soda-vinegar solution on here.
And I guess the other cool thing about this
is the fact that it's natural.
It doesn't contain any kind of harsh chemicals.
Honestly, I was going to use Kaboom, but it
said not to use it on frosted glass, so that's
why I'm using the vinegar and baking soda.
So we'll put this on here.
We'll let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes, and
we'll come back and take a look and see what
it looks like.
Okay, so we let the baking soda and vinegar
solution sit on the shower glass for 10/15
minutes, and honestly, it's looking pretty
good.
The next thing that you can do is use some
common window cleaning supplies, like a window
sponge like this, and clean off the glass.
Honestly, it creates a little bit of a mess
using the paste, but it's not anything that
you can't clean up and wash down the drain;
certainly, it's safe.
And I totally think that this is looking so
much better.
So use a sponge like this.
And then, the next thing that you want to
do, once you get it all clean, is use—whoops!—is
use a squeegee, like so, to squeegee off all
the excess baking soda and vinegar solution.
So do that and then I'll show you the next
step for how we can actually make this not
accumulate soap scum.
But, again, make sure you get this mixture
off, dry it with a towel, make sure it's totally
dry, and then you can move on to the next
step with the Rain-X.
All right, everybody.
This is the last step in this process of cleaning
your soap scum and allowing your new glass
surface, your newly cleaned surface, to not
accumulate those particles, minerals, and
soap residue that creates a faded look.
So you can see here that the vinegar and baking
soda solution worked awesome.
Hopefully you can see that.
If you can't, take my word for it.
It's good to use that kind of paste on a glass
door like this.
And then the second step, like I said before,
is to use Rain-X 2-in-1.
Again, this is 2-in-1 Glass Cleaner + Rain
Repellant.
So what this is going to do is when you spray
this on here—you're going to spray it directly
onto the glass—and then wipe it off with
either a paper towel or a microfiber cloth
like this.
So let's go ahead and do that.
When you do apply Rain-X, it's going to make
water beat off this and run down.
And when the water does that, hopefully the
soap scum will do that too.
So let me show you.
It's fairly simple to do.
You shake it up real good.
Take the top off, and again, you just spray
this onto the actual glass, okay?
So in this case, I'm going to use some microfiber
cloth and just wipe this all over the glass
surface.
It's going to help clean the surface, and
it's also going to apply the Rain-X beating
technology to your shower door glass.
So that's my biggest tip for preventing soap
scum on your shower door, and I really think
that this extra step can help you eliminate
the soap scum cleaning responsibilities that
you have on a weekly or biweekly basis.
So thanks a lot for joining me.
I really appreciate it, and I hope you have
a great day.
