Hi.
Welcome back to another episode of Keep Calm
and Bake.
I am Sarah, this is Andrea, and we are from
the lifestyle blog peanutbuttered.com.
Today we are going to be making Anzac biscuits.
[music]
So we are going to start by putting the butter
and golden syrup and some water into this
pan.
So Anzac biscuits are an Australian and New
Zealand cookie.
We traditionally have them on Anzac Day in
April which is coming up very soon.
They are made with oats and coconut and they
come from back in World War I. Women used
to send over these cookies to their husbands,
brothers, and sons in the war because they
kept for a really long time on the way over.
I am just going to add one teaspoon of baking
soda into this.
So now that that is almost melted, we will
put some flour and brown sugar into a big
mixing bowl.
Give that a little bit of a stir just to break
up any lumps.
And then we will add our rolled oats and some
desiccated coconut.
Combine that all and then we are going to
add our wet ingredients into the dry.
Just going to 
swap for a spatula and just give this a good
mix so it is all combined.
For the full list of ingredients, check the
description box below.
That is almost done and then we are going
to roll these into balls and place them on
our baking tray.
So these really really remind me of back home.
We used to make them every year in April and
also actually around Australia Day as well
in January.
Did you ever have these when you lived in
Australia?
I did, yeah.
They definitely remind me of Australia and
fun memories of back home.
They are so yummy and, like, for something
that does not have chocolate or any extra
add-ins, they are really moreish and really
tasty.
So this is ready to go.
We are just going to grease our fingers a
little bit.
And we will roll these just into balls like
so.
So about that size.
It is good just to press so it is all compact
and then we will place them a few centimeters
apart on the baking tray.
This is a real favorite recipe of ours.
We love it and we hope you do too.

thumbs up.
And we would love to hear how you got on so
leave a comment below.
So these are ready to go.
We are going to put them in the oven at 160.
Now if you like your Anzac cookies a bit crunchier
so you can dunk them in some tea, bake them
for 15 minutes but we like ours a little bit
chewy on the inside, so about 12 minutes these
will go in for.
OK?
So we have taken these out of the oven and
we have allowed them to cool to about room
temperature.
Just a handy tip, we put them in, like, rolled
as balls but if they do not flatten themselves,
you can help them along just with the back
of a spoon to flatten them out slightly.
We just baked these until they were crunchy
on the outside with a little bit of chewiness
on the inside.
So perfect to have with a cup of tea.
Exactly, and if you have tried this recipe,
we would love to see your efforts so tweet
pictures to @videojugfood or @peanutbuttered.
So thank you so much for watching and we will
see you next time.
Bye.
