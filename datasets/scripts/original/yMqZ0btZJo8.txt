i'm making one of my favorite comfort
food casseroles chicken spaghetti and
it's my husband's favorite my kids
favorite so it's going to work out well
for me
i start chicken spaghetti by boiling a
chicken i just put a whole cut up
chicken in a pot brought it to a boil
then reduced the heat and simmered it
for 25 minutes now the chicken is really
tender it's falling off the bone so i'll
let that cool for a second now for the
casserole recipe i'll need some chicken
broth so i just use the broth that was
created by cooking the chicken this is
such a simple dish
and one of the things that makes this
casserole so great is that it's easy to
eat and part of the reason for that is
i break the spaghetti into pieces so i
just do it right over the pot and i cook
the spaghetti right in the broth that i
cook the chicken in so it gives the
spaghetti great flavor
this is about a pound of spaghetti
pieces
okay now while the spaghetti is cooking
i'll get the chicken ready
it's cool enough to handle
so i'm just going to hold it over the
bowl that i'll mix the casserole in
take off the skin as i go
and then i'm just grabbing the chicken
and shredding it with my fingers
i've got a diced onion
and diced green and red bell pepper
now most of this casserole recipe is
from scratch but there's one ingredient
i just can't reproduce and that's canned
cream of mushroom soup
so i'll just go ahead and add in the
salt and pepper
and then i add just a little bit of
seasoned salt
it gives it some great flavor just about
a half a teaspoon or so
now this is also optional but i like to
give the chicken spaghetti a little kick
and i add some cayenne pepper
just probably four or five little
sprinkles
now i'll just give this a stir
and i think the spaghetti should be
ready by now
so i'll just make it easy and just pull
it right out
save myself a long trip to the sink to
drain this stuff
got the spaghetti in there so i'll just
give it a stir
start introducing all the ingredients
then the broth goes in
i'll start with about a cup of the broth
that i reserved
and then at the very end i'll check and
see what the consistency is like and i
can always splash in more
all right now i'm going to grate some
cheese
i use sharp cheddar cheese because it's
particularly delicious in this casserole
when it all melts
and i'll just throw two cups right into
the bowl with the spaghetti mixture
okay now this is where i check the
consistency and it does look like it
needs a little more liquid because it's
baking in the oven you want it to be a
little bit liquidy when it goes in
then it won't get thick and gloopy
okay
now i'll just pour it into a casserole
dish
all that yumminess in there
and then i have more cheese left
and it just goes over the top
if this casserole is wrong i don't want
to be right
all right now this just needs to go into
a 350 degree oven for about 35 or 40
minutes
