here's the top of that vent stack coming
right up through the roof we're right on
top of that second floor bathroom
now if i had a high-powered light or a
mirror that i could reflect light i
should be able to see almost all the way
to the basement i can't see much of
anything
so i brought along a tool today that's
really going to help us
this is actually a plumber's snake
that has inside it a camera that has a
light at the very end
okay we can see there's you say hello
hello and there's me hello
now let's go exploring
all right so i'm gonna just explore now
there's a little counter that tells how
deep i'm going down i should be down
10 or 12 feet before i see
where the
toilet closet bend should come in
just feed it to me tom
all right so i'm down to a point right
above where the branch for the toilet
comes in
there's something in the way something
blue there
if the toilet was flushed i should be
able to see it right now
hey teddy you still down there yep can
you give that a flush again please sure
yeah i can't see anything we are
definitely blocked
hey you know what tom pass me that
green stick right there see this one
here this is a probe the electricians
use it's got a little hook at the end
made out of fiberglass about 12 feet
long
let me see if i can fish anything
see if there's good fish in here
there i am
okay so we probe right in there see what
we get
okay so now that's down
below it let's see if we can
hook anything back
there's something hard right underneath
all that guck
not much like catching a minnow
it looks to be all
dried up leaves so what you got is you
got a bunch of soft stuff on top of
something hard so maybe we should do is
get a hose first and see if we can flush
some of the stuff soft stuff by and see
what's underneath there and let's put
the hose down towards the bottom where
the clog is
you ready to turn that water on
all right here it comes
all right yeah
see that it stopped right up
all right with the hose running i'm just
gonna try and use it like a snake
and clear the soft part of the clog
there we go
hey i think we might have got something
here
cool
hey tom shut the water up come on up
okay okay tom take a peek in here and
you see the camera's right above the old
clog location and now i can go right
down through
hey teddy give that a flush will ya okay
look at that look at that water
you didn't see that before no you've
never been in a place like this before
that's a great view i think your
problems are solved my friend
