hi everyone i'm dee welcome back to
primal beauty queen and today
is the first of my coffee related videos
i don't have a series name or anything
yet
um i tried to think of some and they
were all really late so if you have any
good ones
leave them in the comment below but i
will be doing several videos
related to coffee and i love coffee i
know a lot of you guys love coffee so
why not do a bunch of videos related to
that delicious caffeinated beverage
we all drink every single day so today
in this video
i'm going to be showing you how i make
cappuccino at home without the machine
now you do need a couple tools though i
do have an espresso pot
and i have a milk warmer with a
frother thing and i'll show you how that
looks when we get to the video but
they're together they're much less
expensive than a cappuccino machine and
i
personally like the result a thousand
times better so if you want to see how i
do it all right so the first thing
you're going to need is an espresso pot
now this one's quite large you don't
need one this big
but they come in three parts the first
part
is the espresso cup part with the lid
that lifts off
the second part is the little espresso
ground holder part and third part is
where you put the water
so first thing you'd want to do is put
the water in the very bottom now just
fill it up a little teeny bit more than
what you want for espresso
next you want to fill the espresso
grounds
holder with espresso so if you filled
the water up halfway you want to fill
this up halfway as well
and you want to just push it with the
back your spoon to level
it off you don't want to pack it in
there but level it off and then twist
the top on
and set that aside now this portion is
the milk foamy frother thing that i was
telling you guys about
as you see it's got this really funky
lid with a little mesh piece and sort of
a plunger action going
so you want to fill the ceramic part of
this one third of the way up with
milk if you drink dairy i do so that's
what i'm using
now put both of these guys on the stove
you want to put the espresso on medium
high
and the milk on medium low
and then we wait
you want to wait until there's steam
coming out of the espresso pot
and the bubbling stops
now you just want to pour about one
ounce into your cappuccino cup
or if you're like me you're going to
want a little more than an ounce
there we go
next you want to take that funny plunger
with the mesh portion
put it on top there and pump that about
15 to 20 times
and you'll end up with something that
looks like this as you see the milk has
sort of doubled in volume because of all
the air that's been pushed into it
now you want to take your spoon and hold
back the foam as you pour what's left of
the liquid
into the cup until the cup is two-thirds
of the way full
and now's the time to add sugar if you
want to do that i don't
just stir it up a little bit and then i
add some of the
thicker foam on top until the cup is all
the way full
and that ladies and gents is how i make
cappuccino at home
now if you want to get really fancy you
could always add some cinnamon nutmeg or
cocoa powder on top to make a really
impressive looking cappuccino
that will make all your friends go ah at
your next get together
thank you guys so much for watching i
really appreciate it
subscribe if you liked this video and i
will talk to you soon bye
