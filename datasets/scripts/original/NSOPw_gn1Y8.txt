hello guys and welcome to Food review UK
today I am reviewing cocacola vanilla
flavor uh as has been requested for a
very long time by a loyal uh subscriber
Harry Marshall so I'm finally doing it
um what I will say beforehand is I
actually I'm not a huge fan of coke I
mean I know everyone loves Coca-Cola or
likes it whatever um but I tend not to
have it all that often um I don't really
have fizzy drinks all that
often certainly with meals I will
occasionally have it in a restaurant um
but Vanilla Coke is my favorite Coke I
have had it before and here we go let's
have it
again smells really nice
over ice it' be Exquisite with a
straw well to be
fair it is delicious it is a delicious
fizzy drink um so you've got the rich Co
Coca-Cola flavor which
[Applause]
is essentially like an ultra sweet
vegetable
taste almost
Rooty in in
Indescribable or IR describable irid
describable but it's Coke everyone know
knows what Coke tastes
like and then you've got this really
lovely sweet deep vanilla running
through it's
um it fuses very well with the flavor of
coke
um this particular one little bit too
fizzy for my liking I tend to like them
a little bit flatter but freshly open
bottle obvious going to happen um yeah
great design you know one of the biggest
brands in the world and I this flavor
Vanilla Coke it gets a four
stars it's bloody
refreshing bloody refreshing thanks a
