Welcome to MyBinding How To videos.
Today's question, how to laminate business
cards.
There are a number of different kinds of laminating
machines on the market that can do the job
and there are some that are specifically made
for small and quick applications, like card
lamination.
For this demonstration, we'll use the LP 120,
a very small, compact, and efficient little
laminator that's designed just for this kind
of application.
First, you need to get the size laminating
pouch that you need for your project.
And thickness, they range from 3 to 14mil.
Not all machines can handle all thicknesses.
When putting your card into the pouch, make
sure you get nice even margins.
This makes trimming at the end much easier.
You'll need to make adjustments to the heat
of the machine according to the thickness
of pouch that you use.
Always feed the laminating pouch into the
throat of the machine with the crease side
forward.
This assures the best laminating seal.
Wait for it to come out the back end completely
done, lay it flat on a table so it can cool
completely.
The nice thing about card laminating is that
pretty much any machine that laminates will
work, because the width will be enough for
your card.
That's it, that's how to laminate business
cards.
