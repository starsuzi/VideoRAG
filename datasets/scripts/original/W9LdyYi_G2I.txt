hey guys so today I'm going to be
showing you how I clean my felt hat just
like I told you I would in my last video
If you haven't seen that video and you
want to check it out I'll post a link in
the description box below so let's get
started so first thing you're going to
need obviously is going to be your dirty
gross felt
hat second you're going to need which is
an amazing product by the way
is
Scout felt hat
cleaner for dark colors they do make it
for light colors as well so if you're
going to get this product make sure you
pay attention to that if you have a dark
felt hat like a black hat then obviously
you're going to want to use a dark fat
he color
cleaner if it's um like a cream colored
felt hat then obviously you're not going
to want to use the dark one because it
will dye your hat
dark um second thing you're going to
need is a lint
roller and then you're also going to
need some sort of brush or scrubbing
something or other this is just a dirty
old brush that I haven't really used for
anything other than felt cleaning you
can also use a sponge if you want to
um so I guess should talk more about
about this product so I got this at my
local
Country Farm Store pretty much wherever
you can buy a felt hat they should have
this it's really great it literally
takes me like 30 seconds to clean my hat
um it was like $8 I think and they do
sell a special felt hat cleaning sponge
but I didn't I it's like a dollar and I
didn't really see any use for it when I
can just use a
brush um so let's just get straight into
the video hope you enjoy it all right
guys let's get started so you're going
to take your felt
hat and um with a sheet of your lint
roller you're going to go all over your
hat and just dab it on there to get any
loose dirt Loose Hair um whatever it is
off of your hat and the reason why I
take it off of the lint roller first is
because you can get in all the creases
then and it makes it a lot
easier to get all those random
hairs Li Roller's already used up so I'm
going to grab another one cuz my hat is
filthy okay
okay and if you have any loose dirt
before you put the product on you can
take your brush and just
brush your hat with it

and as you can probably see right there
the reason why I love using these little
brushes is because you can get right in
that crack and scrub it
out okay so now we got most of the loose
dirt off the hat so now to make it extra
clean what you're going to
do is take your
cleaner and spray about a foot away I
don't know if you guys can really see
this and just get a good coat on your
hat now you're going to let that soak
for a couple
seconds and then take your little brush
again and just scrub it
and there you go now for the most part
you got a pretty clean looking hat make
sure you do the underside of your hat
after the top is completely dry because
right now it's pretty wet and any dirt
or dust is just going to stick right to
it as soon as you flip over and set it
on anything so you're going to want to
let this dry first and um as you can see
you're going to want to do this outside
because you don't want to get it on
anything hey guys so um I hope you
enjoyed the video on how you clean your
felt hat um if you have any comments
questions
concerns whatever it is about cleaning
your felt hat make sure to let me know
um send me a message
comment write me a letter I don't care
whatever you want to do
um I do have some ideas for future
videos and you guys can let me know what
you think um I've been working with my
Barrel Horse lately on how to hoe
without pulling on the rins at all not
touching the rains and he stops at least
at a walk right now um but keep in mind
he is a barrel horse he's very hotheaded
and crazy so to get him to
hoe on command like that is almost a
miracle to me um so if you guys want to
see how I taught him how to do that
please let me know and I'll work on
doing that before winter hits hopefully
um and I also had another idea to do a
three-part video on how I train horses
to go in and out of the trailer um I
don't really know if my methods are from
any other trainer it's just always how
I've trained horses to go in and out of
the trailer um it takes a week and at
least um and I don't know my horses all
of them had have something happen to
them that made them not want to go in
the trailer and using this method they
easily go in and out of the trailer
calmly now um I mean my
yearling when we went to go pick her up
she absolutely refused to go in the
trailer and we almost had to lift her
and throw her in the trailer just to get
her home and I did this method with her
for a week and now she literally jumps
in the trailer before I can even get the
doors open all the way so um if you are
interested in seeing that make sure to
let me know in the comments below as
always subscribe and comment any future
ideas that you have for videos and um I
hope you guys have an awesome day
