hi folks welcome to another stahl13.com
video whether it's a hackamore a bozo
what type of bit it is headstall bridal
whatever you want to call it
there's different ways to
put these things on a horse you want to
be as gentle as possible one of the
things that causes a horse to have what
is called a quote unquote hard mouth is
when someone really pushes and forces
things in a horse's mouth so what we're
going to do now is have someone come in
and she's gonna put things on her horse
now this horse is a very gentle horse
this horse isn't used to someone holding
it so what she's doing is notice what
she did with the halter folks she didn't
take it off she unsnapped it so there's
still some type of control
gain here if possible a lot of people
will step on the lead rope just to have
something so the horse can't walk
she's actually got her horse trained to
dip its head to make it easier to put
things in notice how easy is it slipped
in you want to be careful of the horse's
eyes they freak out you want to be
gentle because a lot of horses don't
like their ears messed with
she's getting at the brow band she's
getting the four lock out of the way of
the brow band she's making sure that
it's even and adjusted notice how calm
this horse is this horse is obviously
used to this but she's still being
gentle she's going to make sure that
it's buckled squared away then once it
is she's going to put the halter back on
the horse why
because she's a trail rider she rides
lots of miles on this horse and we've
made videos about how having a halter on
a horse is important it doesn't affect
your
apparatus that you have for control of
this horse
she's sliding it over making sure that
has a nice fit yes it looks ugly yes it
looks stupid but it's safe
she's going to go ahead and buckle it
and you can see
what a nice fit this is and how good
this is and how easy it was to do this
now she's making sure that she's getting
it over the brow band that are bit
everything is adjusted fine
the horse is comfortable with it because
everything is a proper fit now what you
do with your lead rope is up to you
sometimes
some people will take this lead rope and
they'll just put it back like this over
the horn of the saddle but then they
don't like it it gets in a way
a lot of people they'll do what they did
in the calvary days they would make a
single loop around the horse
bring it up a little bit
and then they would go ahead
and just tie it here
let it droop and hang a little bit it's
not in the way and then knot it we've
had one on proper tine of a horse
there's a lot of things you can do with
this
but one thing you don't want to do is
unsnap it because then you've lost your
control you never want to tie a horse up
with the reins we've got a video about
that this has been another stahl 13.
video take care of yourself and your
horses
