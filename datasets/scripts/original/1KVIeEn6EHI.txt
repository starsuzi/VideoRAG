while dehumidifiers can differ from
model to model they all operate on
similar
principles in this video we will
identify the main factors of
dehumidifier operation as well as
potential problems you may
encounter dehumidifiers reduce the
humidity level in your home by drawing
the room a through the appliance and
removing the moisture the level of
humidity reduction is regulated by the
humidistat or by a control board with a
sensor when the humidistat or sensor
detects a need to reduce the moisture in
the air 120 volts of alternating current
is sent to the compressor and the fan
motor the compressor is part of a sealed
refrigerant system that compresses the
refrigerant in gas form and pumps it
through a set of condenser coils where
the gas becomes a hot liquid the coils
dissipate the heat as the liquid travels
through
them once the refrigerant has pass
through the condenser coils and the
capillary tube it travels to the
evaporator
coils as the refrigerant liquid enters
these coils it expands into a gas which
makes the coils cold the gas flows
through the coils to a suction line
attached to the compressor the
compressor will then pump the gas back
into the condenser coils where it once
again becomes a liquid and the cycle
continues at the same time the fan motor
rotates a blade to draw the room's humid
air into the appliance where it
condenses on the cold evaporator
coils the condensation accumulates on
the evaporator and drips into a bucket
or is diverted through a hose to a floor
drain the cooler air from the evaporator
is heated as it passes through the
condenser coils and is returned to the
room this process continues until enough
moisture has been removed from the air
to satisfy the setting on the humidistat
or the control
board most dehumidifier models are
equipped with a bucket switch that will
prevent the appliance from running if
the bucket is
full if you suspect the dehumidifier
should be running when it's not the
bucket switch may be
defective you can use an oh meter to
test the switch for continuity to help
determine if the switch is functioning
or
not both the condenser and evaporator
coils need proper air flow for the
dehumidifier to work
efficiently over time these coils can
collect dust dirt and debris so it's a
good idea to clean the coils regularly
just be careful not to bend the
fins if you hear the dehumidifier
running but no air is being exhausted
then it's likely that the fan motor has
failed and will need to be
replaced if your model is equipped with
an air filter the filter will need to be
clean from time to time to prevent frost
from building up on the evaporator
coils most standard dehumidifier models
require the room temperature to remain
above 65° f for the appliance to work
properly as lower temperatures can cause
the evaporator coils to frost over if
the temperature in your home regularly
drops below 65° you will need to obtain
a model that is specifically designated
for lower temperature
