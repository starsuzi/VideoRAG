hello everyone mr garden projects and
today i'm going to figure out how to
make an insect hotel what i need for
today is 650 centimeter 7.5 centimeter
by 7.5 centimeter piece of wood which
i've got here
150 centimeter 7.5 centimeter by 7.5
centimeter piece of wood which i've got
here
a drill with a crosshair bit on it
which i've got there
a 7.5 millimeter drill bit which i've
got now
an 8 millimeter drill bit which i've got
pencils i've got here
and 10 100 millimeter wood screws which
i've got here
now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
screw the bottom piece of wood
and the two sided pieces of wood
together
i'm going to line them both up
and then i'm going to screw them into
place
now they're both lined up i'm going to
screw them into place
wow
uh
now i'm going to do is i'm going to
screw
the three center pieces of wood
into place
what i'm going to do first is i'm going
to make
two marks
three centimeters from the inside
of the two side piece of wood
along the bottom piece of wood
now i've done that
i'm going to line up
to the center piece of wood
on the outside edge
with my three centimeter mark
i'm going to do the same on both sides
now i've done that
i'm going to screw it into place
so
so
now what i'm going to do
is i'm going to make two three and a
half centimetre marks from the inside
the two center piece of wood
along the bottom piece of wood
now i've done that
i'm going to line up the center piece of
wood
when this piece of wood is into place
like so
we're going to screw into place
now i'm going to see
so i'm going to spin my framework
around
and now i'm going to do is i'm going to
screw the 50 centimeter 7.5 centimeter
by 7.5 centimeter
iris rail into place
i'm going to screw the two side bits
into place first i'm just going to align
the side bit
on the air as well
the other side of the air as well
but with the size of our
nice soap
place
i'm going to screw it into place
so
so
now i've done that
my framework should be like this
now what i'm going to do
is i'm going to make
two incredible three centimeter marks
on the inside
or the two solar pieces of wood
now i've done that
i'm gonna line
two of the center pieces of wood
up with my marks and when i've done that
like so
i'm going to screw them into place
so
so
now i'm going to do
is i'm going to make two three and a
half centimeter marks
on the inside the two center piece of
wood
and on the top piece of wood
now i've done that
i'm going to line the center piece of
wood up with my marks
and now i'm going to screw into place
now i've done that
i'm going to screw the center piece of
wood into place
now i've done that
why is it hotel should like this
as you can see
the three center pieces of wood
with all the holes in
in the center piece of wood
i drilled 34 holes with an eight
millimeter drill bit all the way through
and with
the other two center pieces of wood
