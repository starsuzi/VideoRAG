so the orientation of the nut is this
way and turn the nut clockwise to
tighten
it okay now I can assemble the toilet SE
to this fixture by sliding
in okay so I've got the toilet ster
symbol so you can bring the toil it down
cover down and because I haven't
tightened the nut yet so it's bit
there's some movement
[Music]
here and now once you make all the
adjustment and you can tighten the nut
on the other side and to finish it
[Music]
off is
complete you can see toilet go up very
fast and swing it
down doesn't come down straight away
also bring it up and bring it up
posi hello everyone um so here I've Got
A to Z from EST so it's meant to be a
sub close so in this video I show you
how to install
this okay so first of all I need to
remove the um existing toilet
cover in the sit so in order to remove
SE go to behind sort of underneath the
seid and you'll see a screw and a nut so
you need to undo the knot to um to take
this SE out and there should be another
knot on the other side so two screws and
two
nuts turn the nut anticlockwise to
remove
it okay so I remove the two nuts so
that's it now just comes up this just
lifted and there comes off this
toilet okay so this is the new toilet
SE and there are two fittings screws and
nuts
here so first of
we need to remove this bottom
fixture so to remove it you need to push
it in this two buttons
TS and then you can pull out this bottom
fixtures and this will slide out like
this
okay okay next thing to do is place this
fixture that you just removed place it
on the top of the toilet
bowl and following by this put a screws
fitting and just line it
up okay following by this then put a nut
from the bottom and and do not tighten
it too much just put it on slightly
