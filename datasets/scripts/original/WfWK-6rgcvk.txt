the rind of most cheeses is edible the
exterior is the same cheese but some
with mildew some other more sticky
because it's a wash rind some are drier
and tougher like parmigiano-reggiano
because it protects the cheese from the
elements the rind of a parmesan reggiano
is really tough but it's really good
remove it and put it in the soup it's
going to transfer its flavor to it
once cooked in that soup it's going to
be all soft if you want to eat it it's
going to be possible
a rind that you can't eat is the rind of
a gouda for an example because it's a
waxed rind
