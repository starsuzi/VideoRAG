right I've had a request for a recipe
for bread soaps this is how my
mother-in-law taught me how to do it
half a pint of
milk uh half a medium onion about 3
oz chopped
three
cloves and I don't mean cloves of
garlic can you see those little
cloves uh three of those in there um and
we've got here about 3 oz of white bread
you do need a a blender for
this uh otherwise it'll be a very coar
sauce so I'm going to pop this on the
gas now bring it to a simmer and simmer
it for 10
minutes right the onion and the milk
have been simmering for about 10 minutes
and the onion's now nice and soft so I'm
just going to remove the
cloves there it is number three
turn off the
gas
season nice bit of salt and
pepper and we're going to pop in the
bread
that
stir if it needs more liquid I will Top
it up with boiling water but I think
that might be
okay actually no we add some boiling
water cuz it's quite
stiff you have to bear with me I haven't
made this for many years cuz my family
don't like
it right I've added half a pint of
boiling water to the
sauce it's looking more like it
now I'm just going to blend that
now not to a smooth H sauce but a sort
of a rust stick
I'm bringing it back to the boil
now just to thicken it
again this is
wonderful with the turkey or chicken or
even bangers and
mash it's really
tasty you can see it's quite thick and
gloopy at this point just taste it and
see if it needs any more salt and
pepper very very
nice you can make it the day before if
you like and then just before
serving heat it back up to the boil
and stir in a nice knob of
butter and there you go rad
sauce ready to serve
up
beautiful so Bon Appetit and I'll see
you later
bye
