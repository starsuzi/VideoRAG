um the first thing that I'm going to do
is I'm going
to yes put mustard on this cloth and I'm
going to rub it
in nice and
good and then I'm going to make sure
it's all in there so there we have it
our lovely mustard stain so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to rinse it off
now what they don't tell you is that
with ketchup you want to use cold water
with
is mustard because it is related to the
pepper family you want to use hot water
so I'm going to rinse it with hot
water
okay so as you can
tell our stain is still on the
rag and that's usually what ends up
happening and I've looked online at
several different types of um
videos and to find out how to get the
stain out of this rack and everything I
tried did not work so I decided to make
my own video to show you how to really
get mustard out of your clothes so what
I have made is a paste out of baking
soda vinegar and a little hydrogen
peroxide now what you're going to notice
is that once you put it on to
the rag so you want it it's real pasty
you kind of want to make sure that it's
kind of
thick excuse the really gross
noise um so what I do is I just put it
on there and I'm going to rub it into my
Rag and I'm going to take some paste
with my hand and I'm just going to rub
that
through
now again that is baking
soda peroxide and vinegar so now what
you're seeing is the rag is turning red
and the first time that happened I
freaked out and thought that I had
ruined the rag but what you're seeing
there is the oxidation that is the
chemicals working and um working with
the stain to uh take the stain out so
that redness is um actually a good thing
that means that it's
working so here we go now I'm going to
rinse
it again in hot
water and excuse my kitchen I turned it
into a science lab for the
day so there we have it we have our
stain and it looks like it's gotten a
lot worse um but just to make sure I'm
going to run it through one more
time and again it's going to do the
oxidation
okay now I haven't tried sticking this
in the dryer but I think that it would
probably have the same
effect um and so I'll I'll post again if
that if that works as well but a quick
way is you want it to react with the
heat so the fastest way to get this dry
um I have found is to just go ahead and
iron it with steam so I have set
aside um a rag down here and what I'm
going to do is you want to make sure
that you have a cloth underneath it and
a cloth on top that way um it transfers
on both sides so just like that I'm
going to do like this and I've got it um
all the way on cotton and my steam is
all the way um on the highest steam
so hopefully we can get this to work
let's see
here sure my iron hasn't fallen asleep
on me lights
on
so now I'm applying
Steam and you want to do this for a
couple of
minutes make sure it gets uh nice and
dry and has the time
to uh
transfer and you'll need to check it a
couple of times
and when you pull it up it's going to be
red still unless it's all been
completely dried so as you can see I
didn't use like some big nice fancy
towel I just used a dish towel so I'm
going to pull it up and you can see that
the stain's still there again that's
just um
oxidation so you want to just kind of do
it
again
for
you want your iron to be pretty hot um
if you pull it up too many times like
I've been doing um it makes the process
go a little bit longer than it
should
okay so now I'm going to pull it
back and so there we are got
this so now what we're going to do is
we're going to wash it one more
time with the
stuff with the
paste normally you wouldn't treat your
clothes this way but um you can use it
on
Cotton um
linen uh not wool Not Silk not rayon I
don't recommend any of that I will ruin
it so now we're going to rinse it in hot
water as you can
see we are
stay
fre voila it's
fine
