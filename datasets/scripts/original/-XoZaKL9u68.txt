hello welcome to he-said she-said food
for thought
today we are doing liver and onions so
as you can see onions in a pan and also
we're doing mashed potato with us that's
not really the video is liver and onions
so what you're doing with it
so I'm sauteing the onions I'm going to
caramelize these you put them up high
and then turn really low and let it do
its own thing and here we have liver
liver so to milk a lot of people are
intimidated by this but if you soak it
in milk it takes out the minerally sort
of flavor we're gonna actually coat this
in in flour and then I've only put a
little bit of garlic powder on it I know
it looks promise guys but if you've
never had liver and onions it's high and
I in very high in iron low in calories
and it's high in vitamin D I believe too
so it's very good for yes we'll be back
okay so we're putting the liver in the
flour just all-purpose just with a
little bit of seasoning some salt and
pepper nothing fancy
real easy we dredged it overnight as
well but a lot of you we like the flavor
of it some people do not and then in
that case you can just do it for a
couple of hours and it's good
okay so we've got some mash to boil some
sports and he's got horseradish and sour
cream in it and some milk and it tastes
awesome but we all do a video and I will
make that another time we've got the
gravy we have a couple giant cup of I
don't give a then we put those
these are all our tables so medium high
and 2 min each either side and that's
good enough registers in flour we've
soaked it in milk so you don't have to
do it that long but it works for us and
it's gonna be smothered
and that's pretty much it just two
minutes either side jobs done so it is
plated up we've got the liver the onion
the moisture room my mashing my Peas
it looks beautiful it's going to taste
great thanks for watching
