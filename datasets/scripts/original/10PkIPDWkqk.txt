hello everyone I'm the crafty Ginger and
this is my dog hammy he's going to be
our teacher today he's a guest star he
doesn't typically like to take photos
pictures videos but he's on camera today
so we're going to do some mac plant
hangers um here's four that I've been
playing around with some patterns so um
this one is made with 1.5 mm cord this
is 1/8
in this is 316
and this is 1/8 in so I'm going to show
you in the first video here how to make
this one which is the 1/8 inch cord
other supplies that you'll need to do
all of these include obviously pots and
plants you could also do airplants and a
glass globe like this one here airplants
just need air and water once a week in
order to stay alive so and they like you
know pretty direct sunlight so the rest
of these are just plants I've acquired
over the years that I really love so um
you need a stick if you want to do this
this piece here this is
Driftwood you need 1.5 mm cord if you
want to do the one on the far left this
is 316 cord right
here you can see how thick it is
compared to this which is the 1/8
in you need some super sharp scissors a
brass ring well you don't have to have
brass but just a ring these are bigger
rings for more variety and I kept these
in the package so you could see the
price these are from Hobby Lobby right
here and these are wooden beads also
from Hobby lebby so video number one is
this one right here with the spiral so
what you first need to do is cut your
1/8 in rope I've already done that you
need um six pieces you're going to do
four pieces at two body lengths so just
one two that's two body lengths and then
two pieces at three body lengths and the
reason for that is the spiral you're
only working two pieces around and the
core of this spiral is um just the rest
of the chords so I'll show you how to do
this this is basic knots we have square
knots here square knots here and we have
a gathering knot and that is all the
knots so very beginner basic pattern I
would say okay so we have our cords here
you're going to find the center hold on
to the
center and then feed the Tails from from
one side through and then there's my
Center Point okay now you should have
some ropes that are longer than others
those are the ropes that you're going to
be working with the square
knots and that's
because you're going to have the other
ropes is the core so you just kind of
got to sort of weed those out where are
those longer ones
ones okay that is one of the shorter
ones of
course there we
go there we go so I got a long one there
I'm going to put it off to the side cuz
first we're going to do a gathering
knot and
then that a longer one
there we go so there's my two long
ones put that off to the
side okay to do the Gathering
knot going to cut a piece of
rope see this is about 3/4 of a body
length so now I
know that these are my longer pieces I'm
just trying to kind of keep them out of
the way okay to do a gathering knot
you're going to take one tail end and
you're going to point it toward the sky
then the other part you're going
to kind of create a loop so I'm looping
this like
that and then I'm going to go left
around all of these ropes you want to
make sure the piece that's pointing to
the sky is
still up
above and then you just start wrapping
it around I'm going to scoot it up just
a little bit
wrapping it around all of your
ropes and I'm going to go
around maybe like eight times or so
doesn't have to be a set
number okay and then you're going to
take the tail end and put it through the
loop you created at the beginning oops
so here's the tail end putting it
through that Loop that we created at the
beginning and then I'm pulling this
piece
up there we go don't pull it too hard
because you don't want to
un wrap anything and then just kind of
arrange it okay I like to cut this
off just so you don't have like one
short
piece okay now we're going to start with
these two long pieces that we pulled out
we're going to be doing all left handed
square knots which creates a Twist
so it's kind of like the number four
that you're creating here you're going
to go
over
behind and
through I've explained this a number of
times my other videos and then you just
keep doing the same thing again and
again and I'm going to
do let's see what 20 looks like so
that's
three and as it turns you can kind of
just move the
piece so
that you're kind of working from the
front cuz I always get a little bit
confused about what's going on so you
can see it's kind of twisting
already and you can make the twist more
pronounced by just pulling on it like
that so you can see the twist there I'm
just sort of pulling it back to the
front I think I might have had what did
they have on the other one maybe like
20 so just keep
going and I'm going to turn this
[Music]
now make sure you tighten up your square
knots too you don't want
them
loose so you can see that creates a
pretty cool
pattern
okay let's
see now I'm going to kind of twist it
just a little bit
more like
that so it kind of keeps going now if
you lose your place just kind of start
from the top and just go around so this
was
my piece that I started
with just going to keep going until I
feel like that's
enough
and you don't need you know a ton of
rope for this project because you're not
doing a lot of knots if you can see on
this other piece here the center pieces
are really only
doing like three square knots you know
because these center pieces they're not
being worked at all in the top part of
this so the only ones you want longer
are the pieces you're working here so
let's see how many that is 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 18 19 20 that's 20 okay now we're
going to move down a little bit further
and you can make this
obviously you know not quite as long as
I did so now you're just doing
left-handed square knot and a
right-handed square knot on all of
these and you want them about the same
height
so there's a
left there's a
right I mean you can obviously do
whatever you want but I'm trying to make
mine
symmetrical
okay on the next one now you're going
going to take two so here's a set of
square knot here's it there I have three
I'm going to take two from this one and
two from this one and work those also a
little bit further
down so I did
that maybe like four or 5 Ines
lower and then I'm going to turn this a
little bit so you can see
it same thing right
here here's our first set of knots I'm
going to take these two and these
two okay and then the last set
here and this this plant hanger I would
say is
um you know probably for a smaller pot
like this green pot that I have here
this isn't going to hold a big big pot
just because there's not a lot of
support if you're going to do a bigger
pot I would suggest doing more cords
like maybe two additional cords in the
center so you could have like four
square knots kind of supporting that so
now I did another square knot a little
bit lower like right about
here and at this
point you know once you get these done
you can kind of check and make sure your
your um pot's going to fit in there
okay
there we
go oh I'm sorry I forgot to say so on
that second row we did the Neighbors now
we're doing the neighbors again so
everyone should be back to their
original partner I'm going to turn this
again so you can see the last
one okay
and then I want to just make sure that
my pot's going to fit in
there so you kind of just you know
you're going to be coming from the top
obviously so you got to make sure it's
going to fit from the
top let's
see that's a little bit
tight
there we go okay yeah that'll
fit so if you have like a taller pot
you'd probably want to space your square
knots out like I'm probably going
to I think I'll do my gathering knot
like pretty far down here so it my pot
fits kind of like about right there so
that's how we're going to finish this
hanger oh come on don't ruin my little
leaves Okay
so
you have another if your square knots
get kind of wonky just straighten them
out again so just make sure they're
about
even there we go okay the last Parts the
Gathering knot again we're going to
point one end of this separate rope to
the sky we're going to take the other
end and this is going around my fingers
this is how I like to hold it in there
and then I like to go around the
left just because I'm right-handed and
think it' probably be opposite if you're
left-handed if you're kind of doing it
holding it the same way I am so you're
just kind of tightening it as you go
around and then take the
tail and put it through that Loop that
was created at the beginning that was
around your hand and then pull it up
through see that's why you should use a
shorter piece to it just pulled the tail
like right up there and I'm going to cut
that piece so
now and then I'm going to trim somebody
asked me what I do with my rope
clippings what I like to do with it is
use it for trim on other
pieces or for like little mini
projects so I'm just randomly trimming
this and you could unwind this too I
probably will not right now cuz I don't
want to bore you to
death
so just make sure that fits in
there there we
go
okay there you have it a super easy
plant hanger that you can make in just a
couple of minutes this took me you know
less than 30 minutes to make it from
start to
finish thanks so much for watching I'm
