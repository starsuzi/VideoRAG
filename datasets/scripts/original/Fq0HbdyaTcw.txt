Hello I'm Shelly Green a master's student with the Kent State University and in this video
I'm going to be showing you how to use measuring spoons and measuring cups
First let's talk about measuring spoons. You can measure both liquid and dry ingredients using your measuring spoons
The larger blue spoon is a tablespoon
It can be abbreviated as
TBSP. Or as a capital T in recipes. The smaller
one is a teaspoon. You will see it abbreviated as tsp in recipes
When measuring dry ingredients with your spoons
simply scoop up however much you need and
If the recipe calls for a heaping measurement, simply leave it as it is with a nice domed top. In most cases however
you'll want to take the back of a butter knife and level it off
like that
This is a measuring cup. You'll often see the preview in recipes as a capital C. For this one
you'll simply scoop up your dry ingredients
Pour it in and once again
we want to level this one off. Do it right over top of your canisters. Just in case you miss
Some ingredients, such as brown sugar, you'll see a recipe call for packed cup
To do that simply spoon your ingredient into your measuring cup and
pack it down with the backside of the spoon until it's nice and flat
Finally we have the liquid measuring cups. Liquid measuring
cups are obviously for liquids because they have a nice spout that makes them easier to pour
You simply pour in your liquid still looks just about right on the line
And it's always best to get down on eye level to make sure that it's right on the line. Otherwise, It's very easy to get
too much or too little in a liquid measuring cup. And that's how you use measuring spoons and measuring cups. Thanks for watching
