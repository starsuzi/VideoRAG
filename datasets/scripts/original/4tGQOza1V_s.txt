whole roasted duck i'm here at one of
healthy butcher's most amazing customers
homes thank you for having us here very
well paul lanzarini uh and a good friend
of mine and we're here to do delicious
whole roasted duck now i'm gonna be
honest with you to me
i didn't grow up having whole roasted
duck in my family i know it's a
traditional meal in many parts of the
world uh especially for christmas and
very special events
i didn't grow up having that when i
learned to cook
to me it was you take the legs off you
can feel them or you braise them you get
the breasts
treat them like a steak
medium rare slice thin across the grain
and you have an amazing meal delicious
but
when i came over your house a few months
ago you cooked this whole roasted duck
and it was absolutely delicious that the
breasts were moist the legs had fallen
apart and the skin was nice and crispy
and i said what did you add in this duck
what'd you answer just salt and i said
no way so here we are and a little love
and a little love so
this is the point we're going to show
you uh how
paul adds his love to this whole roasted
duck sounds good great all right so
first thing that you have to know is
that you have to start out with a really
good quality duck so i get mine from the
healthy butcher they're absolutely
amazing there's not a lot of fat on them
everybody always complains about how
fatty duck is but it's just not true
just as easy to cook as a roast chicken
and let me let's just get to it so the
first thing i'm going to do is score the
bird which means basically just thinly
carving in like this
some lines
just to let the fat escape
now we flip the bird around and do the
back as well
helps to have a really sharp knife for
this
next thing i'm going to do which is a
little trick is just cut down a little
bit there
on the leg
just to the bone
this will allow the heat to get in
quicker
and you won't overcook your breast
so are you serving this duck at the
table hold i am or you're gonna or
you're gonna slice it beforehand no
we'll serve it whole yeah yes and so
those those slits are no problem nope
you can see where they are
now all we do is take some salt
you need a fair bit of salt it will help
with draw the moisture out
rub it all in
this will give you a nice crispy skin
you can add a rub if you'd like a rub
but when you have good meat like this
all you need is salt
get all rubbed in there
a little extra
so if you were to add a seasoning what
would you add
you could do
any kind of rub that you really desire
you could do a barbecue mix you could do
a chinese five spice mix
you could rub it with soya sauce if
you'd like a little bit of sugar but i
would leave that till the end because
that'll burn if you do it too quickly
firstly
i like this sometimes i add thyme or
rosemary but that's it
now i get our roasting pan
and you'll notice i have a tray in here
i put the tray in there to keep the skin
off the bottom otherwise it will be
cooking in the fat itself and i want the
air to get around it helps dry it out a
little bit
so
this is the breast we're going to put
the breast side down
leg side up
this way you won't overcook the breasts
as well
and that's it
that's going to go into the oven
preheated oven 425 degrees
middle rack
close it up and come back in about an
hour
so now it's been an hour let's see how
our duck is doing
perfect you can see we're getting nice
crispy skin
let's give it a quick
rest up
after that to get crispy
and we'll check it again in about half
an hour
all right so it's been an hour and a
half we're going to check the bird
it's looking good we need to check some
temperatures
looking for 155 to 165
and there's a couple of areas that still
need a bit of time
so we're just going to give it a quick
little baste
and add some juice to it
and you can keep it at the same
temperature
we do it we could turn it down if you
want
go low and slow but i think that just
will dry out the breast
so we'll check again about another 15-20
minutes
all right so i think our bird is ready
now we can turn the oven off
and take it out you can see it's nicely
brown
skin looks nice and crispy
look at all that great duck fat
it's all been rendered out
save that it's amazing with roast
potatoes
all right
now what i'm going to do is strain off
some of the bits
[Music]
[Applause]
great
and we'll put this thing back on the
oven and the stovetop
and just we just want to get a little
bit of those
crispy bits up
so i'm not doing a gravy i'm just adding
a little bit of wine
deglaze the pan
[Music]
you see all those bits starting to come
up now
so all the time the duck is just resting
juices are all going back into the
breast
just let that reduce a little bit you
can see that color
it's all stuff that you would have
thrown in the sink and washed away
so you can see here what we've done as
well
this is all your fat that came out of
the bird
not much really
we're gonna close that off and keep it
in the fridge
and that'll be good for
i don't know maybe a month doesn't
usually last that long in my house
to cook potatoes
all right
so that's pretty well ready to go
so just turn that down a little bit
all right so now we're just going to
finish off our jou with a little bit of
thyme that i'm just crumbling in
just for a little bit of flavor
and we'll just pour this in
nice
and there you have it
all right so it's time to carve up our
bird
let's take a look you've got your wings
here so let's take one of those off
use your hands as well makes life easier
beautiful
now we're going to take our leg off
you remember that's where we trimmed it
before just went down a little bit
now we're going to cut here
you can see how nicely that cuts away
[Applause]
and there's your leg
now let's take off one of the breasts
just slice down the middle
just take it away from the bone the
breastbone there
you can see it comes away quite nicely
quite easily
there is your breast
now let's carve it up
you can see it's juicy
and all that fat that was underneath
there is all gone you're left with a
lean meat and a little crispy bit of
skin
look at the juice that's coming out on
the table
man that looks delicious
and there you go nice and easy
that's all it is to it it's just like
doing a roast chicken try it at home
it's amazing everybody's gonna love it
[Music]
