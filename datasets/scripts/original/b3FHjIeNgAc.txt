probably going to get up to about 80
though
we've been having cool mornings a lot of
Breeze I know you can probably hear it
when and I hope you can hear me all
right but today we're going to do a
little bit uh I'm gonna build my steps
I'm hoping to complete that today I'm
going to show you my material in a
second also I'm gonna do a little grass
cutting anyway without any further ado
let's get started on something and then
we'll go through the day
all right y'all
I took the old steps down broke them
apart I was able to save one of the
stringers it's a five-step
Stringer I'm gonna need six
ground out here is a little bit tight
and closer to the home so we'll need a
six step Stringer and uh I'll need three
of them so probably what I'm gonna do is
let's check it out first and then we'll
trace it out and just add an extra step
see how that comes out as opposed to
using a
Carpenter Square for that anyway Let's
uh
let's look at this
all right guys day seven
starting with my stringers for my steps
I used one of the old stringers from the
old steps by the house
to make the
way one buddy
to make the strangers for the new steps
I needed to add two extra steps to it
because it's a little higher out here
than it is closest to the house so it's
going to work fine and uh
just want to show you that let me show
you let me use this with my pattern to
make my other two my steps are going to
be
the stuff's gonna be four foot wide
and I'm gonna have handrails coming down
each side but here's my pattern I need
two more cut like this
use the old Stringer
has a pattern like I said I added two
extra steps let me show you a little
close-up of this Max leave you alone
what you want to get down
come on
all right there you have my Stringer
it's gonna be one two three four five
six seven step
and six may do and if that's the case
I'll just cut it down but anyway I'll go
check that out in a second
we just wanted to give you another a
look at that I'm going away we're going
to cut the other two out I'm gonna put
my other two boards up here and use this
as my pattern I'm going away guys
all right guys

six seven steps gonna be
perfect
I'm gonna put my uh back piece mounted
here use a 4x8
