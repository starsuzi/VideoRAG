Grilled vegetables are a quick, easy, and
delicious side dish during grilling season.
Zucchini, asparagus, onions,
peppers, and mushrooms all get
sweet and smokey on the grill.
Here's how to grill all your favorites!
Step One:
Prep your veggies.
Wash and dry the vegetables
you want to grill.
Some veggies, such as asparagus,
corn, and mushrooms, can be grilled whole.
Eggplant, onions, peppers, and zucchini,
cook better when they're cut into pieces.
Step Two:
Oil them up.
vegetables have no fat,
so they need a light coat of oil to keep
them from sticking to the grates.
A little oil also helps get those
beautiful grill marks.
For extra flavor, add a marinade
to your vegetables.
To make a simple, all-purpose
vegetable marinade, whisk together
a quarter cup of olive oil, a quarter cup
of lemon juice, a quarter cup of minced,
fresh herbs like, basil, oregano,
thyme, or rosemary.
And if you like garlic, add 2 cloves,
finely minced.
Pour the marinade over your vegetables
and let them steep in a glass bowl
or plastic bag for at least one hour.
when you're ready to grill,
just shake off any extra marinade
to prevent any flare-ups.
Step Three:
Heat your grill.
For gas grilling, preheat on medium
for ten minutes.
If you're using charcoal, fire it up until
there's a good coat of ash.
After the grill heats up,
clean the greats with a wire brush,
and wipe them with oil to
prevent your food from sticking.
Step Four:
Grill your veggies.
If your vegetables are large or whole,
you can cook them right on the grill.
Smaller vegetables need a grill basket,
so they don't fall into the fire.
Flip the basket once or twice,
to make sure they're cooked evenly.
Small or cut vegetables can also be
threaded on skewers for kabobs.
Be sure to soak bamboo skewers in water for
20 to 30 minutes to keep them from charring.
If your grilling a variety of vegetables,
start with the ones that takes the
longest to cook, like eggplants,
and onions.
Asparagus, mushrooms, peppers,
and zucchini generally cook a bit faster.
Cooking times will vary depending on
the type, and size of vegetables.
And how crisp or tender
you want them to be.
Grilling potatoes, carrots, and
beets takes and extra step
so they don't char on the outside
before their tender on the inside.
One trick is to boil them in water
until they're partially tender.
Then, dry them off, brush with oil,
and finish on the grill.
Another trick: cut them into bite size
pieces and grill inside foil packets
with oil, butter, herbs and seasonings.
Grilled corn is a summer picnic favorite;
and there are several great grilling
methods to satisfy your family.
For basic grilled corn, simply husk the corn,
brush with oil and lay it directly on the grill.
Cook for 8 to 10 minutes,
turning frequently so it cooks evenly,
and gets nice grill marks. Or, husk the
corn, and place each ear on a separate
piece of aluminum foil, add a dab of
butter, and a dash of seasoning.
Seal it up and place it on the grill
for 20 to 30 minutes.
Turn it occasionally for even cooking.
For the most concentrated corn flavor,
grill the corn right inside the husk.
The trick here is to soak the corn,
husk and all, in water for 30 minutes.
Drain it, and put it on the ground for
about 20 to 30 minutes, turning
occasionally, so the corn kernels
steam, while the husk chars.
From garden, to grill, to plate,
enjoy fresh vegetables kissed with
the smokey goodness of the grill.
If you're already grilling meat,
