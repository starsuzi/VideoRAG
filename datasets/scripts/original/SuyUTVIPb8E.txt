how to laminate first you will need your
document and you will need a sheet of
laminating paper find the flat space
open up the laminating paper as such and
get your document and fit it centrally
butt to the back of your laminating
sheet like so making sure that towards
the end it is still square fold over the
laminating sheet to close it into its
pocket and then take seamed edge already
place it into your laminator which make
sure is switched on prior to doing this
and has the ready light switched on and
let the magic begin
and voila a laminated sheet of paper
thank you please like
