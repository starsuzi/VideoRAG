hey it's Roger here Saturday morning as
you can see land around the house on
typical Saturday wife's been telling me
for about a month now that the washer
has been making some funny noise would
you please look at I said I get a later
well later came and um now it doesn't
work at all so she's a little
upset so what we have here is a world
pool do what
sport
and what we got
no it's already unplugged but anyway
it's um it won't drain and you turn it
on it goes to drain just gives a slight
hum kind of like that now we uh fixed
the dryer a few months ago and the
problem with the dryer was a
thermister uh we had the repair guy come
out three four times to do that and he
never got right my wife and I did a
little bit of research we figured out
was a ther it's a $35 repair and we
posted we didn't do a video on that one
but we did post some uh written
directions and I'll link to it from
there so anyway this one I have no idea
we think that actually she thinks that
it might be um a clogged pump um or
hopefully there's a filter underneath
there um the repair guy has been out
here before to fix it because it was
loud and right down underneath
here right down here this is a this is a
in the newer houses now by by code they
have to put this pan underneath these
washers so if they leak they don't flood
the the floor and there's a there's a
hose that goes out here and it goes
downstairs and goes outside but so we
have to work around that but right
underneath here right down there there's
a there's a um a little bolt and there's
one on each side so we going to start by
taking that off and then this this whole
cover here will come off and then I I do
believe if I remember right the pump's
back underneath here all right so let's
get
started all right so we got this little
setup here to get past here you what it
is it's a/ qu inch socket that you're
going to need for this little
screw looks like that over there two
hope there
problems it's
three all right we'll number three there
you go check
off look like look at
that that there looks like some sort of
cleanout to
me so it's got some sort of thumb screw
on it and let's get some towels and um I
bet you we unscrewed that a bunch of
water comes out and I bet you there's um
some sort of screen there and a bunch of
probably dog fur and
stuff let's make sure these are the
correct towels they use honey can I use
these towels yes see always ask your
wife which towels to use cuz if you use
the wrong
ones it's not good you probably already
know that
anyway I remember folks I really don't
know what this thing
does water's coming
out oh you know what I bet you it's
going to drain this
whole this whole thing of water
the sucker up to right there with
water what we might have to do is just
drain it into the pan and let it go
outside let's make sure that it's um
unclogged itself
first boy I hope they made this thing
watertight
those pans getting pretty full it's
almost up to the bottom of the washer
there doesn't really look like it's
draining back there so let's put a hold
on this for a second figure out what the
problem
is okay the washer's finished draining
we got in there with a shop back suck
that water out let's
see hopefully we got a bunch of dog here
in here and that'll fix the
problem now some sort of lint trap got
some stuff in
here looks like a like a
dime this is um oh this is a cap to my
uh thumb
drive this is a penny and we got some L
well this thing looks like it's doing
its job but I don't think
that that's going to fix the
problem I think it's this
pump I think the pump just went bad this
thing's still under
warranty
so I have to call the man out to come
fix
it but it looks pretty straightforward
if it needed to be
replaced looks like you unplug the wires
from
here disconnect this disconnect that it
looks like it's pretty
simple but I don't think we need to pay
for it if we can get warranty to cover
it but what I will do is put this this
filter back in and uh start up again who
knows maybe maybe that's
it all right so I got
this this uh drain cap back on and um so
all the water is drained out of the tub
now but let's see I got plugged
in let's see if it does
[Music]
anything door's lock Hey
look it's it's been moved
did
something making
noise look hey it's
spitting but remember this is making
noise but remember we also already
drained the top so we going have to run
a load to see if it was the opinion the
diamond the thumb drive Cap all right
all right folks so what we did is we uh
we put it on a a Rin spin filled up with
some water you see it's 21 minutes left
I'm definitely not going to sit here and
hold a Camcorder for 21 minutes and make
you watch that all right so I'm going to
set it to drain you have to pause cancel
oh I have to pause cancel do it again
and then you have to and flashes and you
got to do it
again sounds like it's good Dr sounds
like it's draining
folks see look at that water's going
down I can hear it I can hear it going
out up
there and that thing is just whisper
quiet well I wouldn't say
whisper
so I think that this little device here
did its job and the whole
problem whole problem was these three
little things here so you
got right right in
there all all the water this is how it
works folks you got the tub in here and
then when it drains all the water comes
out I hope you can see it that big black
hose right there and then goes into here
this this um it's got this filter the
screen in there that filter out stuff
like this so it doesn't end up in in
your pump and so right here there's a
hole about that big
well this stuff here this is tough to
show you with we got two hands but this
stuff here blocked up that hole right so
now you got a hole that big and it made
all kinds of noise and then eventually
just quit draining but what we just got
is it's fixed cycle complete all right
so there you go there's how you fix your
washer from um not draining on a
Saturday morning makes your wife for
really happy makes me happy cuz she's
happy and took probably I don't know
what do you think an hour yeah if you're
not not filming with the camcorder and
you don't have to screw around with the
shop back probably takes you about an
hour okay so anyway have a nice weekend
see you next time something breaks bye
