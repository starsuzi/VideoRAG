okay gm's got me a new reservoir kit
coming
um i was noticing brake fluid leaking
out of the seams
especially in the front here just a
little bit
plus as we all know as these caps leak
too so gm does have a uh
service bulletin out for the technicians
for the new uh reservoir kit
uh tomorrow i'm going in to have it
installed
i'll post up uh vids when they're done i
do use the uh super blue dot
four so again keep an eye out on your
reservoirs here
they do leak out of these seams i don't
know what happened just
they don't seal correctly and you will
get a little bit of seepage it's not
much but uh boy it's something to keep
an eye out for
all right i'll post the uh the next vid
tomorrow
