I've got a situation here at a client's
house where the garbage disposal is
completely clogged up too much pasta at
one time too much chicken and turkey
leftovers down the drain too much at one
time and it clogged up the inch and a
quarter inch and a half drain line and
there's too many joints there so it just
got clogged up and didn't flush out so
now I've got the the task in front of me
to go ahead and take that apart and
clean that out and get that cleared up
for
okay as you can see here the the side
where the garbage disposal is completely
clogged up so we're going to have to
clear up everything underneath this sink
and get to the plumbing
now the first thing you want to do here
obviously is to clear out everything
where you can work I have a large bulb
large container and where this can catch
the water because this side where it's a
double sink so this side is completely
clogged up this is this drains pretty
good over here on this side of the sink
um but this part where the Garb disposal
is is completely clogged so you want to
start out at the the P-trap
and just unscrew this and
um you're going to get wet have some
towels paper towels whatever you want
and
go ahead and disconnect that completely
up and take it out of the way and then
you've got another section here that
you're going to have to unscrew as well
take it
and unscrew that and yes there is going
to be some nasty debris and let's see if
we can do this you can catch it see it's
already clogged up completely there so
come on ahead and get rid of that
that looks clear there except I still
have
hahaha
now I'm going to go ahead and clear that
out
now what we've got a situation to where
this right here is completely
clocked so I'm going to take this loose
here
and then disconnect this as well
take this tilt section out
and again guys it's going to get messy
here so just be prepared
um
so just keep working with it
until it completely lets release it
there
and as you can tell
it was a mess
foreign
is clogged as well as you can see there
so I'm going to go ahead and
release that clear that out
foreign
first thing you want to do here
obviously is to clear out everything
where you can work I have a large bulb
large container and where this can catch
the water because this side where it's a
double sink so this side is uh
completely clogged up this is this
drains pretty good over here on this
side of the sink
but this part where the garbage disposal
is is completely clogged so you want to
start out at the the P-trap
and just unscrew this and
um you're going to get wet have some
towels paper towels whatever you want
and go ahead and disconnect that
completely up and take it out of the way
and then you've got another section here
that you're going to have to unscrew as
well
take it
and unscrew that and yes there is going
to be some nasty debris and let's see if
you can do this you can catch it see
it's already clogged up completely there
so I'm gonna head
get rid of that
that looks clear there except I still
have
now I'm going to go ahead and clear that
out
now what we've got a situation to where
this right here is completely
clogged so I'm going to take this loose
here
and then disconnect this as well
like this tilt section out
and again guys it's going to get messy
here so just be prepared
so just keep working with it until it
completely lets through leases there

and as you can tell
it is a mess
all right
all right
now that section
is clogged as well as you can see there
so I'm going to go ahead and
release that clear that out
now that you've made sure that
everything is completely cleared out and
there's no food trapped in there you
want to also Gander up a little bit with
the finger if you want to make sure
there's no food trapped a little bit
right here
in this up spout so I want to go ahead
and clear that now
got that out of the way so I don't want
any debris in here whatsoever
okay now we're going to do everything
backward originally
this was the last step so I'm going to
take this off here the Clue the key to
this is there's a skinny side and a flat
side right here and so you want to put
the the flat side on last the skinny
side up first so I'm going to put this
up
I'm sorry I'm gonna put
the washer
on last so I go ahead and put this up
and then take the same piece here on the
tailpiece and make sure it's back far
enough I'm going to make my connection
that that
thing so
screw this back on
and then screw this back on
you may have to push down
to make sure
that the washer goes down as well it
makes that connection
so that tightens up and you only want to
do hand tight you don't need to get a
pair of pliers or anything like that
craziness to make sure that you've got a
good solid
connection there but just hand tight
it's fine
and then you put your P-trap on
you're going to do the same thing here
I'm going to take
the screw in part here off
and then I've got my washer inside again
the washer the flat side of the washer
right here goes on
last so I'm going to put
skinny part there
now the key to this putting everything
back together this is the last piece we
took off so we're going to put this on
first
I wanted you to take a a close-up look
at the washer here there's a flat side
and then there's a I guess a tapered
side you want to put the flat side up
first so how this goes back on just to
refresh your memory put the washer back
on first then put the I'm sorry
so how this works is you put the
screw top on first you put the flat Edge
going up with a tapered end down
okay so that's up there up and out of
the way
push this washer back
there's the connector there as well
and then fit the two pieces back
together
and then
screw everything on
like so
and that way you have
a good hand type connection again only
do it hand tight now I'm going to back
this off just a little bit because
once I put this connector back on at the
top the screw top it's going to
interfere with the little tabs and it's
the same thing on yours as well so I
don't want to interfere just
right now so I'm going to take this and
now tighten it okay
now we're going to do the same thing
um here this is the P-trap
and again I'm going to put
the
screw top on first
and then the flat side of the washer
goes up with a tapered in down
I'm going to go ahead and
now you know obviously it makes sense if
it's already fitted which size goes in
so I'm going to go ahead and put this in
first
make this connection here
and I'm going to screw this on the
bottom piece on first
um the reason is because of the
I don't know how high and how low to
make this so this is going to obviously
make the be the determining
Factor here
okay
now when you're screwing these on make
sure that you have
each part of its Square because you
don't want to start cross threading and
that's so easy to do with this plastic
going in so
I'm going to go ahead and square it up
make sure that it's on there
correctly while I'm
adjusting it
okay
okay that and now my final piece
here
and again
the tabs sometimes according how close
this is pretty close
the tabs will
interfere
to some degree but there's enough enough
flexibility in the PVC
and the plastic here
for it to um
connect
okay everything's hand tight
there
and there now the secret to all this
all this work here is to make sure that
there's no leaks so how I'm going to do
this is put a couple of pieces of of
paper towel underneath here to check it
turn the water on flush it out make sure
everything drains really good in the up
upper Parts both the left and right part
of your double sink and you're ready to
go okay we're ready to go ahead and test
so let's turn the water on here
make sure I don't have any drips
and I'm looking at the at the paper
right here to see if I have any drips
there
and a belt on that side
Let's test it on this side
and there's no drips there so okay so
now we're completely ready and finished
with this and that's how you test to see
if you have a leak underneath your sink
by putting paper towels down
