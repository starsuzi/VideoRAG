on this episode of ultimate outd doors
uh we're out picking some leaks as you
can see all this behind me here all this
green is uh wild leaks and uh they are
very good uh pick them clean them uh
people pickle them uh put them on
sandwiches uh anything like that uh very
good this is a this is a really big
patch here uh just you can smell them
they have that oniony smell and uh they
are delicious so we uh we're going to
pick
some uh show you how to clean them and
how I uh pickle them and man they are
good it take them on camping trips and
hunting trips or or whatever and uh
they're delicious so uh let's get some
picked and uh uh we'll go through the
process and show you how it's done and
this this place this place here is just
covered I mean all this green you see
here I mean this is this is
leaks it's just phenomenal how many's in
this
area it's a big
patch
very
good well here's a leak uh some people
take the greens they boil them up or put
them in salads different stuff like that
I don't do too much with the the greens
but uh the bulbs I like that's a
bulb just if you want to eat one out
here in the woods just kind of clean it
off with your fingers I snap the end of
it
off they are
good they give you bad breath though
they'll keep people away for days but
boy they're good cold beer M good stuff
uh about another week these are going to
be gone I see the the leaves are
starting to turn yellow so uh the leaves
will be all gone and you won't see the
leaks
anymore so I'm getting them right at the
tail end seem to be a little hotter I'm
not sure pretty good
stuff
all right uh here's the leaks I'm just
going to clean them up
basically here's your leak just peel
that skin down on it just clip off the
end of The
Roots clip off the the greens and then
drop it in a
bowl and they'll be ready to wash takes
a little while kind of a process but uh
it's worth it in the end get this done
and then we'll uh
we'll do some
pickling must be the dog wants
one that's all there is to it pretty
simple uh there's probably different
methods different ways people do
them uh if you come up with a better way
let me know cuz I the better
way now we got our leaks all uh cleaned
up we're GNA process them we're going to
pickle them can't wait we're
good first you got to have uh 32 o of
vinegar you're getting it all over good
stuff right
there
okay we got to have 16 o of
water like that we got to have
have half a cup of
sugar and then a
tablespoon of canning
salt and
then got to bring it to a
boil
okay while we're waiting for that to
boil we're going to pack the jars with
leaks then we got to add some stuff into
the jars after we get these in there
before we put the uh the brine in
there
okay now now we got the uh the leaks in
the jars uh we had to go through and put
a teaspoon of uh cery seed in each one
and a a teaspoon of mustard seed in each
one and they've already been done except
for this last
one okay and then we have to put a/4
teaspoon of
alum in each one the Alum is very
important without the Alum they'll get
soft and mushy this keeps them nice nice
and crisp so you want to make sure you
get the alum in it now we're just
waiting for our our brine to uh boil and
uh then we can start filling the
jars okay it's boiling now so uh going
to turn that
off over
here and now we're just going to fill
each JY right to the
top
there fill them pretty close to the top
and basically when when the we put the
lid on it the uh the boiling water as it
cools it'll seal the lid for us and then
they're done ready to be put away and uh
wait a few weeks and they're pretty good
very good with
beer leaks uh leaks are usually picked
in
May late April to
May uh right now they're probably
getting to the end of their cycle so I
didn't get as many as I wanted to this
year but I did get some at least
so okay putting the last lid
on there now we'll just let them sit as
they cool them seals will suck in and
they'll be
sealed
cool yeah
okay here's the leaks that we uh pickled
the other
night no better time to try them than
now two weeks on two
weeks they good the beans are good can
