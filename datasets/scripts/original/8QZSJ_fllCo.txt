hi and welcome to Cajun cooking TV
tonight we're having grilled shrimp on
the grill and Mike's going to be
grilling that for us but I'm in here
doing the prep work so we have some
jumbo shrimp one pound of jumbo shrimp a
bell pepper and onion we're going to
skewer those on some um bamboo skewers
so let's get started with
that and the recipes available on our
website at cunc cooking
tv.com just want to mention that I have
some bamboo skewers here that have been
soaking in water for about 20 minutes
they came in a package like this 100
pieces um these are about 10 in I said
yeah they are 10 in how about that it's
on the package these have been soaked
and they're wet and what I have here in
this mixing bowl this beautiful um jumbo
shrimp I put some bell pepper and uh one
onion a sweet onion and in this mixture
there's a liquid down here I put in a
half a cup of margarita mix a half a cup
of orange juice and um a half a cup of
olive oil so that they would get um
flavorful and also prevent it from
sticking on the grill so that's what's
going on here equal parts I like
stuffing equal
parts all right what we're going to
do is we'll pick a bell
pepper I like bell pepper and the onion
to be my anchors so you want to leave
about an inch for the grill man to be
able to handle them so about like
that then we're going to go with a
shrimp and I don't like to do them just
like this cuz they flop around on the
grill you see that and then Mike has
trouble um turning them so I'm going to
put skewer in down by his tape
and then again towards the
front so really you have it like this
it's a little bit more stable so we're
just going to push him on
down I also have some beautiful fresh
pineapple we got from um Whole Foods
today and this is just awesome on the
grill put it in here like
this and then put a shrimp the these
skewers are going to hold two large
shrimp and then the um saving all the
onions for you yeah okay just
checking I'll put some onion
first and I like to put the curved in
towards the shrimp so that it fits the
shrimp skew it
that and now the shrimp just fits in
that curve of the
onion now we need something on the end
you want another onion or a bell pepper
here's a bell
pepper all right so as you can see
pretty simple we got a few of these to
go so it's going to take me about 10
minutes I'm just placing them on a wax
um sheet here on a platter and then
we'll come back and show you how we
grill it got them all skewered two on
each skewer we have eight skewers of
shrimp pineapple onion and red bell
pepper we had some left over so I threw
them on another
stick um so these look gorgeous
especially with the red and the yellow
magic dust here Tony's Creole
seasoning sprinkle this
lightly over
them and remember the full recipes

kind of chips you like the con would
probably be good yeah they all would be
good yeah none would be good I'm going
to cover it to keep it from flaming up
we use Smoky which is our favorite
charcoal
grill and um I probably turn them
in 3 to four minutes I'm probably doing
three or four minutes on the other
side
dark compared to when we came out here
okay the shrimp um the shrimp kebabs
have been on for 4 minutes now and I'm
going to turn them then we're going to
let them go for another four or five
