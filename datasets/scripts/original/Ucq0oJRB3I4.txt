hello everybody I decided to make a
video to show you how I clean my ferrets
ears this is Thor he's the more docile
one so I'll use him first because he's a
little easier to handle to show you how
to do this so it's really important to
clean your ferrets ears because all that
wax buildup they can more that's in
there the longer it sits they're more
likely to get ear mites and this is how
my vet told me how to clean their ears
so what I use is hydrogen peroxide just
regular hydrogen peroxide and you can
use cotton balls or q-tips I use q-tips
I think they're easier I put everything
on a paper towel to keep it clean and
you're gonna need treats those they
definitely don't like this and so first
how I get started is I pour some of it
into the lid be patient nope drink that
on the paper towel and then dip the
q-tip in just so that it gets wet so one
wet side and then you're gonna have to
scruff them so grab them by the skin on
the back of their neck this is the wet
side and I use this finger I have to
push his hair out of the way and I just
stick it in and I'm gonna start just
twisting it in those really dirty spots
I know you don't like it and try and get
in all the crevices
you'll see the wax start to come in then
I use the dry end to dry it all off and
to really scrape out so you get even
more wax and so I'm not just rubbing
around wax in this ear get a clean one
and keep doing that just check all the
crevices switch it around get another
clean side you don't want to stick it
down in his ear just in all the little
folds
he doesn't mind the dry part he just
doesn't like the wet the wet swab this
one's a little more clean let me I don't
know if you can see inside his ear let's
see if we can get a good view you don't
see any more earwax see if we can see on
this side if you can see it very well
yeah you can kind of see all those
little spots
I'll give him a break for a minute I
know he does not like that
see I grab I grab a big handful cuz you
never know how many you're gonna need so
for this side dip it in again get it all
wet
I'm sorry and this time I'm gonna get
this ear same thing stick it in and
twist it around I know I know
you got a lot there you have to move his
hair out of the way or else because they
like to close their ears really tight
when you do this so you really have to
push it in there sometimes
I've grabbed another clean one almost
done
yeah there's a lot there
Oh sounds really bad
let's get it all out of his ear okay
good boy huh now I'll give him a treat
so he doesn't hate me
[Music]
[Music]
Loki's ears are usually a lot worse than
Thor so you get dirtier a lot faster I
don't know why you just do but he's
usually a little calmer while I'm doing
it so he's a little more fidgety before
though let's see if we can see inside
his ears
[Music]
more dirty once again dip it in the
peroxide get it nice and wet scruff him
and then take the wet end first just
start off gently
it's being difficult today
okay Howard
no dirty clean dry one and just wipe it
all out yeah they're both about three
years old and this had a much harder
time at first but as time has gone on I
think they've learned that if they just
cooperate a little more it goes a lot
faster I know we're almost were halfway
done halfway done okay
okay
this time
okay
stick it in and just gently twist it
well thank you
push it into those folds especially up
here and I know I'm sorry
you don't we really don't like that I
don't and the dry side
grab another toy room
do one more
okay and we're done see if we can see
you can see the difference don't worry
we're done much much cleaner now we'll
get him
Jemma cheats there you go and that's it
