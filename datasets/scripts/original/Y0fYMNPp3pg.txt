to dry our mint we need to cut it the
best time to cut would be in the morning
or evening when it's cooler outside we
want to avoid cutting our mint in the
hot midday Sun
[Music]
remove any leaves that are yellow or
brown any that have been munched on or
still have the bugs still on
them to wash my mint I put it on a
Baker's cooling rack and rinse off with
the hose outside if you're working with
just a bunch or two then you can just
rinse off in the sink because I dry so
much of it I do it this way
[Music]
I let the mint dry overnight outside on
a bench with space in between the boards
to allow for air circulation in the
morning it is all
[Music]
dry make Bunches of similar length stems
and tie them together into a bunch I dry
any small pieces on the cooling rack
[Music]
hang the bunches upside down in a dark
and dry
[Music]
place after 2 weeks the bunches will be
completely dry and crispy to the
[Music]
touch to store my mint I cut off the dry
leaves into jars close with a lid and
put back into a dark and dry place
[Music]
