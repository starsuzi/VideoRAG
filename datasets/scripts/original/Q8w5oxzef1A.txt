Hello All..Namaskar
Hope u all r doing good
Here we r also doing great ..
Today I am going to make Batura an easy way ..
I was getting so many requests for this recipe
So here comes the recipe ..
Without wasting time lets begin
For that take a wide bowl
To that add 3/4 cup of curd .. always use same measuring glass for everything to maintain the quantity ..
beat curd with a fork to remove the lumps ..
don't make as butter milk consistency
add this as thick form only ..
pour the curd to the bowl
I am following my same procedure of making poori and chapathi ..
we r adding flour to liquid
next we need is milk ..
I am going to add 1/4 glass of milk first ,and if need more  will add later
If we add more milk  at first ,sometimes our dough may get too soft ,so we will find difficulty in rolling  batura
Now add salt to taste
add 1/2 tbsp of sugar
mix these sugar, salt ,curd and milk well
now keep that aside
Now we need flour
For that I have taken 1/2 tight glass Atta(Wheat Flour )
pour to a strainer
Now measure 1 1/2 cup maida (all purpose flour )
that also pour to the strainer
now we need baking powder
add 3/4 tsp baking powder
now add 1-2 pinch of baking soda
baking soda is not a must
it will give more softness to the dough .. if u want u can only add baking powder
now sieve this two times
we r serving flour so that all powders will mix well together
now its done .. all powders r mixed together ..
now take the curd mixture
to that add 2 tablespoon each of flour mix and slowly mix well with a spoon or fork
I am following the same recipe for making chapati ...if we add flour to liquid it is very easy to knead and make dough
here I used atta to roll our batura easily
Usually people make batura only with maida
If u don't prefer atta then add 2 cups of maida
and for those  people who don't like maida ,u can make the same recipe with 2 cups of atta and omit maida :)
still it tastes good
and one more thing ,if u want ,u can use instant yeast instead of baking powder
if u want to add yeast then take 3-4 tbsp of water add 1 tsp of yeast and mix..then add that to the curd mix ..mix together and do the same procedure
but I don't prefer yeast for batura, always use baking powder
now use ur hand knead the flour
if the dough is too soft then after resting for 2 hours it will be more soft and very diff for ur handle
so the dough should be bit tight
so add flour little by little and knead
so now the dough is very hard ,so have to pour 1/4 th of milk too.. so we altogether added 1/2 cup of milk
knead well ,, the liquid and flour measurement may vary ..it depends on the flour u use
so add milk according to ur four ..so first add 3/4 cup curd d 1/4 cup of milk ..mix and see ..if needed add this extra milk ..k ..
a drastic change won't be there ..that I am sure :)
so the dough should be like this .. a bit hard
knead well for 2 more minutes and allow to rest
if u want to keep the dough for further days used can store in an airtight container
then take out and microwave and make to room temperature ..then make batura
to the dough pour 1 tbsp of oil and mix well ..
now cover the dough with a clean and wet kitchen towel and close the bowl and keep for 2 hours in a warm place
so 2 hours is over .. have to heat oil for frying Batura
take a kadai
pour oil and heat in medium flame
take out the dough .. now its soft
knead for two more minutes
then make small balls
u can role with the help of oil and flour
I prefer rolling with the help of flour ..but always use less amount of flour for dusting
if the batura is covered with full of flour ,then if we dip in the oil ,oil will burn soon ..so after making 3-4 batura the oil will be black in colour
so always dust and roll with small amount of flour
roll to any shape .. shape doesn't matter dears ..taste do matter ..so don't worry :)
the thickness should be even in all sides
I made a medium size batura
if u look u can see all sides are equal thickness
if the middle part is very thick and sides are thin ,then batura won't puff up
and see in this u can't find no flour .. if u have flour left on top then remove and fry
so like this roll rest of the balls
for testing whether the oil is hot enough ,add a small piece of dough ,if its puffs very soon as soon as we dropped it ,that mean its very hot
if its still laying under ,that mean oil is not hot enough
otherwise if it puffs up slowly then the oil is correct hot
now oil is ready ,gently place the batura
always insert fully inside the oil ..so that it can puff up
and with the help of a strainer just gently press top of the batura
then flip to other side and remove from the oil when its golden colour
always fry in medium flame ,never fry in high flame
some people add sooji to get the crispiness
so if u want crispy batoora ,u can add 2 tbsp of sooji to the flour mix and make
the thickness of the batura souldnt be too thin nor too thick
so make the rest of the batoora tha same way
have with ur fav combination..I like Chole/chana masla
