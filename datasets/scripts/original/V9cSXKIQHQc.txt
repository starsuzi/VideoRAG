Hey everybody
it's noreen and this is going to be the first video in our getting ready for the holidays series for
2010 [I] know that I told you in my little teaser that we were going to make a whole lot of different things
We're going to start off today by showing you how [to] make your very own vanilla extract now
I don't know if any of you have noticed the price of vanilla in a store lately
But I've been doing this for about a year
and I can tell you this will save you some [serious] money a
large bottle of pure vanilla extract at Sam's Club Runs between nine and Twelve Dollars
And that's fine
It could last you a while
But why pay all that money when you could pay a lot less and you can make this and give it as [gifts]
[I'm] going to show you how to make vanilla extract and I'm going to show you how to make vanilla sugar
But the secret is where to get your vanilla beans from?
So let me show you
um these are vanilla beans these are Madagascar vanilla beans and
This is a one-pound bag. I have been using off of this for a little while [um] [I] get these from a company called
[it's] vanilla products [usa.com] and
you can see their
their sticker there and
I get these on ebay and they have any configuration
of the [kept] quarter pound half pound whole pound two pound ten ounce you can buy a
Madagascar new Guinea, or Bourbon vanilla Beans or
tahitian vanilla beans your choice
And the best part about these guys is every time you buy something if you every time you make a purchase
They always send you a little something for free. So that makes it even better
let me show you what we're going to do for the
For the vanilla extract what you need to go and do is get yourself?
[I] make mine in Jelly jars these are eight ounce Jelly jars
each Jar get six bill beans, and I'm just going to cut
These beans up like this
nothing special just
Stick these pieces in the bottom of the jar
Just like this
and then I want you to go to
Wherever it is you buy alcohol?
You need to buy the cheapest rotgut vodka you can find okay, and it has to be 80 proof or better
Otherwise this isn't going to work. Don't use rubbing alcohol
And we're just going to cover this
Like so um I don't drink this vodka. I would never drink personally
But this is perfect for making vanilla extract
And now after you fill these up I?
Want you to put a nice tight lid on it. You can go ahead and use the the lid that came with it
The metal Lid with the ring. I personally like these plastic lids that you can buy
Around canning time you can also order these off the internet
They're not that expensive give it a good shake
And I want you to put this in your pantry in the dark cool place and every three days
I want you to go and give this a good shake
then
after about six weeks
This is what you will [end] up with it is the most beautiful
Rich Dark vanilla that you will ever have now the best part about this this has mileage
You get down halfway fill it up with more vodka give it a shake every few days
And you're going to have awesome vanilla that you made yourself and for pennies this didn't cost you nine dollars
Because I'll tell you what this bottle of vodka this bottle of vodka cost about ten bucks
There's a whole lot of these in this bottle
So and this'll last year while but the best part is you can give this as a present
I mean who wouldn't want to receive a jar of homemade vanilla as a gift. [I] mean, I think that would be just awesome
so
We're going to put those up to the side the next thing. I'm going to show you I'm going to dry like here
I've got a little alcohol zero counter
Okay now these
These I've got [four] vanilla beans here and I am going to cut them in half
I'm going to put two in the bottom here, and I'm just going to start layering
sugar vanilla beans
sugar
vanilla beans
Sugar and vanilla beans and then fill it up all the way
use the Lid
Put that there
Leave that alone
[and] you my friends will have delicious vanilla sugar that you can use to put on top of muffins
You can use it in recipes, and it will impart a lovely vanilla Flavor
The vanilla Sugar, [I] don't know if you've [seen] [it] in the grocery store some stores only have it around Christmas time
But it's a little german company
And they usually have it with the baking supplies at Christmas in different parts of the country
They come in little envelopes
And they come like six envelopes [-] a little cellophane package and each envelope has like a teaspoon of vanilla sugar in it
That stuff is like six dollars. You [know] that's like a dollar a teaspoon who is that so?
Make yourself your own vanilla sugar use it in whatever [you're] [using] [in] your coffee. I bet it would be delicious, [so]
This is the first in our series

To share with your family and friends if you have some ideas that you'd like to see me do
