hi everybody and welcome back to cook
and cheer it's harvest time here and
apples are really cheap in light of that
we decided to throw together an apple
based dessert called mini apple crumble
you can put this together in a matter of
minutes it's affordable comforting and
delicious so if you got a pile of apples
k around you're going to want to make
this dessert so let's get started what I
have here are some green apples and I'm
just going to begin by peeling these you
can use just about any type of apple you
wish then I'm going to slice them in
half and now into
quarters cut out the
core slice them into thin
wedges and set them
aside next what I'm going to do is add
the apples into a
pot followed by the sugar you can use wh
or brown sugar whatever you
prefer a little bit of
water and I'm just going to cook this
over a medium low heat for about 5
minutes just until the apples begin to
soften after about 5 minutes and the
apples have softened I'm going to turn
off the
heat and transfer into a ramkin now if
you don't have these containers you can
use small baking cups just about any
small container you have kicking around
your kitchen that you can put into the
oven now what I'm going to do is add the
remaining juices to the ramkin just so
it doesn't get too dry while it's
baking next we're going to begin making
the crumble mixture by adding the
oatmeal to a mixing
bowl follow by the
sugar some
cinnamon some allpurpose flour
and I'm just going to mix this until
it's well
incorporated then I'm going to add the
butter that I've cubed
up and using my fingertips I'm just
going to mix everything until it's
crumbly then I'm going to cover the
apples with the crumble mixture using an
up just so it comes to the top of the
ramut now we're going to slip our Mini
Apple crumbles into a 37 75Â° preheated
oven for 20
minutes after 20 minutes we're going to
remove them from the oven and you're
ready to
serve I like to serve these while
they're hot but we're just going to take
a little peek inside and these smell and
taste absolutely
delicious and there you have it our Mini
Apple crumbles an easy and delicious
