hey everybody Welcome to the wolf pit
today I'm going to make a Chinese carry
out favorite egg drop soup simple easy
and delicious so let's get
started I'm going to start with some low
sodium chicken
[Music]
broth now let's add some flavor to the
chicken broth with some soy
sauce some toasted sesame
oil Shing Chinese cooking wine
sugar and a little bit of pepper now
just bring this up to a light
[Music]
boil while that comes up till boil I'm
going to make a cornstarch slurry which
is equal parts cornstarch and water and
I have about a teaspoon of each I'm just
going to mix that up and then I'll be
used as a thickener to thicken our
[Music]
soup
once the broth has come up to a boil
pour the cornstarch slurry in and just
give it a quick
[Music]
stir last but not least we have to get
our eggs ready so I'm going to beat four
large eggs and you want to beat them
until they're nice and
[Music]
smooth slowly drizzle the beaten egg egg
into the
broth and turn the heat
[Music]
off now take a spoon or spatula and move
the water gently back and forth that way
all the eggs don't stick together and
you should have nice little ribbons of
eggs
and there you have it a Chinese carry
out classic egg drop soup garnish it
with a little chopped up green
[Music]
onion last but not least enjoy after
making and eating this you'll never have
a reason to order egg drop soup again
thank you guys very much for watching I
hope you give this a try and I'll see
you next
