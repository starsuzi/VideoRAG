leech he is so tired like leachy oh gosh
poor baby okay all right is that the end
of him yeah we're going to just dry him
off and then they'll fall
off all right so you're going to have a
lot of dead fleas like you just saw in
the video and they're still stuck to his
fur so when you're dry him off what
you're going to do is you're going to
get your
towel and rub his uh his head like
this and then that what that will do is
dry him and at the same
time you're going to see that the dead
fleas will start to fall off of
him they literally fall off
