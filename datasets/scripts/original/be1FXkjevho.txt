today everyone this jaet cetro welcome
you to cetro craft Channel cetro fashion
School Channel today I'll be making a
travess TP tub and I'm not going to
measure majorly on the basic bodies
because I have a video to that so if
you've not watched that video please try
to do that I'll just cut out the basic
buies pattern just an easy way but it's
been great in our fashion school and
we're doing Lots and lots more so I want
you to just try to give me a thumbs up
if my videos has been highly educating
to you then why not share our videos
give us your likes subscribe and send in
your comments so that I could just
upload more videos that would be
beneficial to you so today let's just
get started you know as SL and as C
fashion School whatever we're doing is
as easy as A and B and C so let's get
started your trp to to yeah so what will
you be needing you be needing your
measurement parameters so well you need
your bust measurement your bust first of
all you start with your shoulder to your
nipple Point shoulder to nipple then you
get your nipple to nipple point this way
after your nipple to nipple you get your
bust measurements this way after your
bust you go to your on burst on burst
the end of your burst under burst then
after your under burst you go to your
half length that's just basically what
I'll be needing for this video so
cutting out our strapless top top
pattern is just as easy as A and B and C
so I'll be leading the following
measurement parameters I'll be using
bust as I've shown you how to measure it
bust 38 I'll be using shoulder to nipple
10 shoulder to under breast is 14 then
the half length is 17 the waist is 34 in
the round waist is uh round on the burst
is 32 in and your across back is 15 so
let's get started first I'll
determine my starting point this
way then my neckline
if you've not known how to do this you
just watch my
video on how to achieve your neckline
[Music]
if you don't know how to achieve your
neckline just watch my video on neckline
and it's so easy so across back
is 15 I'll divide by two that's 7 and A2
I add half in so in
allowance AR hole is 18 you divide by
two that's nine just to be on the safer
side I'll use 8 and a half you could
trim
off
later so with this you've arrived at
your armhole then you drop the shoulder
by 1 in
so you're good to go so you slant the
shoulder this way because the human
shoulder is not straight as you can see
my shoulder it's not straight so the
slope depends on the shape of the person
so it could be/ in 1 in or 1 and4 in so
it's just that way and this remember is
your chest line this line is your chest
line so you could just extend it this
way if you so
need then your bust line come this way
the bust as you can see shoulder this is
the shoulder point to the Boss line is
10 10 but you had half in sewing
allowance so I've already haded it on my
pattern so I once I've haded it on the
pattern while drafting on the cloth it's
okay so that's 10 and 1/2 in that's the
bust point the bust line then the under
brast
is 13 and2 with one with half in and
make it 14 then the the the half length
is 17 with sewing allowance I'll make it
17 and a half so with this I'm going to
go I'll just dra draw out the lines
remember this your
chest chest Line This is the bust Line
This is the under burst and this is the
waist line so you suting our measurement
parameters now now you now need your
nipple to nipple some persons call it
across bust nipple to
nipple I'll be using eight so eight you
divide by please assume your pattern
whenever you cut you you're sewing your
fabric this pattern is on two fold this
the front panel then the back panel will
also be on two fold so when you imputing
your measurement parameters you divide
by four just basically because the fold
of the fabric is into four places so
with that you're good to go then you
come to this bust line you determine the
nipple to nipple four then plus half in
sewing allowance just could be five some
persons are cross the bust or nipple to
nipple is five so you make it five then
plus half in sowing that's 5 and2 but
I'll be using four that's I'll be using
nipple to nipple 8 I'll divide it by two
because this is on two fold that's 4 +
half 4 and a/2 so you have the 4 and a/2
this
way then you make this line you you
really down to the waist line then want
to take hard that so when you come to
the waistline you could just take in 1
in here 1 in here then you could take in
1 and 1/2 in on the under BST why you
know this a strapl tube tub you want the
shape of the burst to go in a bit when
you comes to the under burst location
like this so that it will be grippy and
it form a nice shape then it will have
the the the strap this way then you
could use the Yol for another 10 so
that's why you go inside by making this
you you take one in here then you could
take 1 and 1/2 in here 1/4 in there
about so that it goes inside more than
this then we're good to go so here I'll
be taking 1 in on both sides
here I'll be taking 1/4 in on both
sides this is one
and4 on both
sides yeah so we join our lines
right now
so having arrived at this you now want
to arrive at the upper part of the tube
of the strapless soup top so what do you
do just determine the location the
inches between your burst and under
burst the inches between your burst and
under burst for some persons it could be
3 and a half it could be 4 in it could
be 4 and 1/2 so I want to use 4 in so
from this bust line from this boss point
you just extend you just make an
extension of 4 in half so that you could
take your DTS this way and this way that
you use to form the tube the strapless
tube so it's just as easy as A and B and
C so I'll just place my tape row forward
this way you extend this straight line
so that you take your DT and from the
strapless to cut so let's just do it you
extend it to 4 Points this way could
make it 4 and
qu so you take 1 in you could take one
and4 in on both sides could take one and
half let just take in 1 in on both sides
so it's very easy you just form this do
to this
point so
you can see it's as easy as A and B and
C so this is the point that will form
the strapless tube cart and you could
decide to make it a what is it called
just a round neck a v neck you could
make it a sweetheart neck but most
persons like achieving sweetheart neck
especially if you want to use it with
this African fabric that you just use
lace on top and Y could have lace or
whatever so most persons love the
sweetheart neck so you could just make
and the slope of the sweetheart all
depends on you it all depends on you
know the sweetheart will just come this
way some persons will like it just very
a bit this way some persons will like it
to really get to their cleavage and
they'll cut it down this way it all
depends on
you it all depends on
how slopy or how cvy you want your
your sweetart neck to be so some persons
like it to be so C this way then you
could
just do an extension here just join this
this
way then you connect the
center and with this H strapless to to
is ready then you take your measurement
parameters the measurement parameters
our bust is 38 38 divided by 4 give us 9
and 1/2 in this 9 and 1/2
in then remember all these are dots the
highest thatt I've taken so far it's 2
and 1/2 in as you can see so I'm going
to add just to make it easy I'll be
adding 2 and2 in as my d that's
allowance on all these measurements then
I now also had 1 in for sewing allowance
so that will make it 3 and 1/2
in so if you you're sewing allowance if
you
had uh 2 in for sewing allowance so you
could just make up for that so the under
burst is 32 divided by divided by four
will give
me8 so I'll add 3 and 1/2 in remember
how I got my 3 and 1/2 in the dots look
at this dot I've removed 2 and 1/2 in so
I have to hard it 2 and 1/2 in to it to
my measurements because this dot I will
cut it out then you now had what again
you had 1 in for sewing allowance or 2
in that's how I came about that then the
half length on the half length the waist
is 34 in 34 ided by 4 will give me 8 and
1/2 and I had 3 and 1/2
in so with this just have your shape
this way could shape it this way or if
you don't want to use the under burst
shape you could just shape out this way
so and when you're sewing on the pattern
you sew out so let me just use this
straight one without using the
underbrush
measurement so with this you're good to
go right now you know your dad should
not have sharp edges should not have
sharp edges so what do you do you you
try to use your C to to cve out please
note that DS are not to be sharp edged
edged I mean
so you come here as well
so having shaped
out giv a that this cvy Edge so you
could have your shape this way or you
could also have it using the under burst
and you're cutting out the under burst
this way so either of the two it all
depends on the one you
want so you could also use your C to to
smoothing the
Hedge so with this we are good to go
just cut out and your strap next to top
is ready
[Music]
w
this we have the front panel of your
tube
top of your strapless tube top you see
could like it to come in like this it's
this is the front part then just cut cut
out the Yol
so with this you're ready if you're
having your round neck you could just
cut out the type of neck you want on the
upper part if it's a round neck or
whatever neck you want to have
[Music]
so with this you can see it's as easy as
A and B and C that's our slogan at Cal
Fashion online school so you can see we
just come out remember I told you this
shape is very important you C it out
after taking your D you could just use
this C to look for the cvy parts of the
C to you can see with this you you shape
out the bust shape the bust shape the
Busta shape or the BS cut shape that's
just it for your strapless tube top if
you just want to have the tube top this
way or without the yolk but if you
making all these African fabrics they
you have the yolk so you just could be a
lace or whatever and your own sweetheart
could not be inside this way it could
just be here this way it all depends on
how you want it and it's as easy as a
and B and C so if the front is as easy
as A and B and C so you can tell me the
back panel will be as easy as what let
me not talk so let's get started with
the back panel cutting your back it's
very easy this way first thing you
create an allowance for your zipper for
your zip so you can make it 1 in 2 in so
I'll just make it 1
in this way
really it
down so this is your zip
allowance is your zip
allowance
so all the depends on the neckline you
want for the
yolk is still the same three and a half
all this has been explained in the B's
pattern drafting video so if you've not
watch it make sure you do that please so
remember before you cut out
your front panel before you cut out the
that you have just placed the front
panel on the back to cut out the the
basic body pattern then you could just
draft it and if you've not watched the
video please try and do that just make
this low
as 2 in or 2 and 1 12
so then you come to the normal back 7
and
A2 at the half2 in so L now get my
handful
so this is your chest line now you
determine your bust line at the back
remember there is no bust at the back we
just cut out our that so this was so
allowance 10 and a half and
14 for allowance and a half this way so
it's just very very easy
this a burst Line This is the under
burst and this is the waist line then
this is the chest line so remember
there's no bust at the back you just
take your DTS in a easy way just like we
you just take it from taking it from the
bust line just use your same nipple to
nipple is8 you divide by four that's 4
and A2 Plus Sewing allowance so you draw
that that you draw the line
straight
down so you take you could just take
half in on both sides you know it's the
back and the back doesn't have any
allowance for bu so it's just very easy
just take half inch on both
sides see is 1 in so you draw out your
DTS this
way this you good to go then what do you
do now oh this the chest
line having your chest Line This
Way this your armit
this the cvy shape of your arho so you
could just come down by 1 in or 1 and2
in so that when you cut the Yol at the
back you could just lant it and you have
the Yol up and the back because you're
not doing any V or Swit neck at the back
so you could just come
down you could just come down it's by 1
in or want qu in 1 and 1/2 in and you
could
just draw the slanty shape this way to
your
armhole right so remember you take your
normal measurement
parameters and considering the fact that
the back we just took one in that so
that will be noted in my allance that'll
be adding remember the bust measurement
on the first line is 34 we divide by 4
the fabric or the pattern is into 4 fold
so that give us 9 and A2 and the highest
that I'm taking so far is 1 in you can
see it 1 in that so I'll make an
allowance for that 1 in then I make 1 in
sewing allowance or I can make it 1 and
1/2 in sewing allowance any howow you
want it so with that I'm just adding 2
and2 Ines so you come to the under burst
the under burst is 32 that's
eight
so that's 2 and 1/2 in
remember it's just for 1 in that and 1
and2 in so in allowance or 1 in so in
allowance then the waist line is 34
that's 8 and
A2 cuz your normal 2 and 1/2
in so
I could just cut out this
way then I'll use my cff
to have a c
here so your strapl L to top is ready
just as easy as a and b and c
[Music]
so remember you open up your zipper zip
LS this way and with this you're good to
go just place on your fabric cuz I've
added the needed measurement parameters
so
just just as easy as A and B and C
remember your zip will place this
way folded in this way
this and with this you're just good to
go for the
back the back of your strapless top top
so you can see it's been just
easy it's been so easy you can see
automatically our that is out our that
is automatically out so and you just
