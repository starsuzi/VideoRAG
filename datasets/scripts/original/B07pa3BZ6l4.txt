little tiny bag oh just a little bit of
blueberry scent
but there's like nothing in it I'm kind
of
the Catholic kind of off did it spills
it doesn't smell like blueberry I guess
they just don't fill up the whole
container literally nothing in here
except like a little tiny bit next thing

solo lids
to get in this cardboard out of here
and the last but not least
[Music]
I think I broke it two plastic bowls

gonna do the neon scented slime first
I'm going to pour it in
measure three millimeters of water room
temperature water in
to make neon slime measure one spoonful
of colorant
and out of as much as I want to guess
it's more of a pastel than neon guys but
we'll make it work to make a scented
slime add a few drops of descended into
the bowl with the glue and water
one two three now let me just mix it
so measure two
level spoonfuls of slime powder antique
and table one
two just got 15 millimeters of water I'm
gonna add it in
