Queen who said vegan wasn't
[Music]
fun hello every welcome back to the
channel I'm Rachel from pineapple and
kale and today I'm here giving you five
amazing delicious vegan breakfast ideas
they're going to be hearty they're going
to be in fact I don't want to give you
too much information but you might be
thinking Rachel why five breakfast ideas
because I want to reach everyone's taste
buds everyone who's watching this is
going to find something that they love
about at least one of the recipes and
they're going to go and make it now and
they're going to be like Rachel that was
boom because you're going to love it and
make sure you stay tuned to the end
because the final one that I'm doing is
that end of week much needed hearty warm
fulfilling fry up tyght breakfast that
you're going to love and you're going to
want to make yourself so make sure you
stay tuned the first one that I'm going
to do is going to be the really easy
three ingredient pancakes that's it
three ingredients they're vegan and they
happen to be glutenfree all you need is
3/4 of a cup of oats a cup of alond milk
and half a ripe banana and then I'm just
going to use my vamix my handy V miix to
blend it all
[Music]
together so there we have our little
mixture now I'm just going to fry in my
preferred type of oil to use is coconut
oil but I right now
when you're making these pancakes what I
recommend is that you put the oven on
and you make it one by one and keep the
ones that you've made in the oven to
keep them warm if you want to pile them
up I mean if you want just one just make
one this is Hazelnut and cacao spread
cocoa I pray it is like let's do a taste
test I'm really excited
but this is the the only chocolate
spread I've tried that is vegan that
resembles Nutella it's quite creamy
somehow let's put on the
pancakes so this is the kind of
consistency if you can see the way it
drops it's quite
[Music]
thick
oh I have to go and show you guys this
look at her look at her
ing she's going to taste real
[Music]
good pancake so
obviously chocolate's
spread oh it Glides on just like Nell
[Music]
did deliciousness
[Music]
can I just say the three ingredients to
make a pancake of Oats banana almond
milk fake Nutella bananas hemp seeds
blueberries like I've giving you a good
breakfast idea guys and it's not going
to take too much time it's simple it
doesn't take long to make the pancakes
is
banging so this one's a little bit
different I'm using frozen berries ice
oats armor milk and adding Mac powder
I'm adding uh if I'm going to the gym
sometimes I add protein powder to this
too uh the one that I use
is this one here this one does the jar
um and a bit of a gve and then I add
some fruit on top and to be honest I
would rather it be an asai bow but it's
really hard to get as your berries in
the UK you can get the powder but I
don't want the powder I really want the
actual berries when I was in Brazil for
a couple
months I ate it like every day it was
Bloody delicious but anyway I'm just
using frozen berries for this one add
oats it's is the morning you know you
need to start your day with some
carbohydrates so we add some
[Music]
oats that was about just under a half of
a cup up frozen
berries I would say that's about half a
cup just more add a bit of
aaby maca there are a lot of reasons why
different people use Maca it's great for
energy and it's great for balancing your
hormones you don't have to use
this I don't put too much it's probably
like less than a
teaspoon ice which gives it just more
like on a hot day it just makes it so
much
[Music]
myself I'm unsweetened almond
milk going to need more than that so I'm
going to have to get another
[Music]
one you got to shake it when it says
shake it shake
[Music]
it I think that's about half a cup
[Music]
so I think I'm going to add a little bit
more
[Music]
milk smells like
[Music]
berries so refreshing
[Music]
blueberries hem seeds
bananas
it's you know what it's really nice on a
hot day it's really nice before after
the gym and you can add protein powder
if you
[Music]
want who said vegan wasn't fun next
breakfast so the next one I'm going to
make is a chia pudding I think
everyone's seen Chia puddings everywhere
because they're delicious they're
convenient you can take them on the go
I'm going to keep it simple and just
make chia seeds with coconut milk and
then I'm going to add fruits like
pomegranate bit of agave this is a/4
cup of chia
[Music]
seeds oh that that got messy
[Music]
a
[Music]
garlic this just needs to go in the
fridge and sit um what's really great
about these is you can make them the
night before put them in the fridge and
the next morning breakfast is ready so
you can soak these for up to overnight
the quickest you can do is like 20
minutes half an hour and you'll get this
kind of teer pudding consistency that we
all love look at this juicy pomegranate
so I'm going to add some blackx suits um
blueberries I have added all the
deliciousness you can put a lid on it
take it to work and it's delicious and
it's sweet and the
pomegranates so them they're so nice
that you like you bite into them and
it's just like
[Music]
of pomegranat and it's really nice so
now we're going to make a green juice a
nice green cuz you got to have a green
one to prove that you're healthy right
you got have a green one we all know
that dark leafy greens are your best
friend they're full of nutrients and
full of vitamins and this organic wheat
grass is jam packed with nutrients and
minerals and vitamins that are just
going to boost your day boost your
immune system and boost you as a person
so you want to add this so I'm going to
add it comes with these little if I can
get it out
whoops um or you can have
spirulina banana I have some dates that
I soaked
earlier um for sweetness coconut water
which is really great for your hydration
by the way a
handful of some more dark leafy
greens if you can't bear the taste of
greens which I can if you can't just add
some sweet stuff in there and it just
takes it away
[Music]
completely let's give it a world guys
and see how it
tastes it tastes really
good talk about perfect
proportion now I know what a lot of
people are thinking Rachel that looks
disgusting but I promise you it does not
taste disgust well to me it doesn't
it actually tastes really nice I know
it's green but it tastes good and you
saw the ingredients it's packed with
some good stuff for the people that
don't want to eat heavy in the morning
this is a great alternative to just have
a juice that is packed of nutrients it's
just going to make a world of difference

day you're feeding your mind you're
feeding your body you're feeding your
soul guys you got to do it sometimes
