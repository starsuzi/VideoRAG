as your dog ages his dietary needs
change but each dog is an individual and
age is not the only consideration a
healthy senior might need a diet high in
fiber and low in calories a senior who's
losing weight might need more calories
and Senior Dogs with certain health
problems might need a diet specially
formulated for their disease when it
comes to feeding our Senior Dogs I
recommend buying a highquality food if
your dog has special needs due to health
problem your vet will be able to
recommend the appropriate diet talk to
your vet about how to gradually change
his diet if necessary
