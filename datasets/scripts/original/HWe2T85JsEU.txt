hello I am going to be showing you today
how you prepare your chicken
again um before you think of cooking it
first of all when you take the chicken
out the package you cut away the fat
that you don't need that is sitting on
the chicken and secondly uh you scrape
the chicken and take off all the residue
the the there's a yellow vase that sits
on the chicken you have extra skin on
the chicken the end of the drumstick so
you need to scrape all of that away and
then um you wash if it's a old chicken
you can separate the the parts of the
chicken and you you skin the chicken
take off the skin if you don't want the
skin there and also you cut away the fat
that is there too that you do not want
now I am going to be washing I have some
drumstick here that I'm going to be
washing and I am going to be using a
lemon this is the lemon and I am going
to also use salt I am cutting the lemon
and I'm going to use a half of the lemon
for the first
wash and uh so I squeeze the lemon juice
half of the lemon the juice into the
water I also going to uh place the the
rhyme of the lemon in there and I'm
adding a tablespoon of salt and the
reason for that is that you don't want
the meat to be very slippery in your
hands so now I'm going to wash this
chicken in a massaging motion so that I
can get the residue that is sitting on
the chicken that um your eyes could not
see and as you wash the chicken I want
you to pay attention you always pay
attention to the water what is coming
off from the chicken and so you massage
and massage M
Massage make sure you you wash the
chicken
properly and now I'm going to be
draining that water
off now I'm going to be adding a second
set of
water also the other half of the lemon
by squeezing the juice into the
water and of course a tablespoon of salt
in that water and I'm going to be
massaging and
massaging you just don't take the
chicken from the
package season it and put it in your pot
you just don't do that and all you know
that there's a lot of um feathers still
sitting on the chicken so you need to
get all of that
off so you massage and you
massage and now I'm draining that water
off and again I'm adding a turet set of
water now if you feel
that the water um if you see the water
does not look good to you it still look
a bit murky then you would wash it for a
fourth time rinse it on a fourth
wash so you
wash don't be afraid to wash the
chicken you won't hurt it so don't be
afraid to wash it and and massage
it I'm going to be adding a four of
water the final
rinsing before I put it to
drain again you see people showing you
on the TV how to prepare a meal but
they're not showing you how to take care
of the meat before they do that so now
I'm going to be placing this this um
drumstick into another Bowl
and then I'm going to put it in an angle
so as to drain the rest of the water
that is sitting there on on the
chicken before I attempt to season
it here we
go so I'm going to fold uh one of um my
dish right
and put this bowl in an
angle and
there so now I'm going to show
you how to uh to mix your
seasoning I thank you for looking at the
program and um I hope you learn
something from this
