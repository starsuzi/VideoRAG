thanks bruce marjani here
got some chicken
i got it all
picked apart
i boiled it off and
i'm gonna make me some chicken
enchiladas tonight
i'm gonna make this video in response to
hickenfield 2009.
he's having a contest on his channel
and he's a great youtuber
so i wanted to support him
right here just put in some chili's can
of chilies
and i got some uh
some green enchilada sauce here
it's a kroger brand if you got any
stores near you
sells a kroger brand
that's pretty good deals this week got
the chili's i think for 50
uh 52 cents a can something like that
and then
that green enchilada sauce i got that
for
i think that was
about 50 something 60 some cents a can
too
super good deal it's usually
twice that
we'll mix that up a little bit here
i'm gonna throw in some onions too
get these all simmering warmed up
start slapping together my enchiladas
once this is all
warmed up
we'll be back in a flash
all right here we are
got my uh
my stuff all heated up
ready to throw in some these tortillas
here
so here's what i do i just
take a nice little scoop of that
spread it out a little bit
and roll it on up
i do that with the whole package of
tortillas
a little bit more right there
there we go
looking good
i like to use a green sauce with the
chicken well actually i like the green
sauce about anything
whether it's venison or chicken or just
beef
i use the red sauce once in a great
while but
i prefer to use that green stuff
i got myself another can opened up
to pour on top when i'm done
wrapping these babies up
but anyways like i said this is a
video response to
hickenfield 2009's 50 subscriber contest
and he asked it to
be cooking something and this is one of
my favorite things to
make up for dinner so
i thought i'd make this up
and uh he also uh
wants to see
our favorite gun
and i'm going to show you guys uh
my favorite gun you guys most of you
guys have probably seen it before see me
shoot it a couple times it's my
ruger single six
blackhawk
new model blackhawk
357 stainless steel
hey uh
i got it when i was a teenager it was my
first pistol and
paid for it with my own money
and uh
always
cherish it
never get rid of it
so i just got
a couple more here
about half of this one you're all
rolled up stuff that guy down here
scrape all the rest of these bittles in
here
there's some dude stuff here buddy
as my good buddy ammo head would say
that's good with a bunch of using it
all right
there we go now we're going to take pour
some of this
green sauce all over the top
sometimes i put a little bit of
olives on here you can put all kinds of
stuff in these things whatever you like
some people throw rice in there i'm not
a big fan of rice i wouldn't make very
good [ __ ]
or mexican for that matter
i just don't
don't care for that stuff very much
i need a little bit of it now and again
here we go put some cheese on there
gotta have lots of
cheese nachos and tofu cheese here
i got the oven warming up to
all about 350
and i'll throw it in there until the
cheese is good and melted and stuff with
the
getting that
chicken all heated up before i put it in
there it don't take long to warm this up
i just like to get that cheese
a little crisp
so
well that's my that's how i do my
enchiladas i'll throw that in and
that was awesome
so we'll we'll toss that in there and
once that's ready

i'm back with the old pistola
this is my ruger
new model blackhawk 357's
stainless steel
i got these grips on here i actually
made these grips myself
as you can see it's not the
not the best fit on these but i was in a
hurry
i had some
hog over molded grips on there and i was
going to a sass shoot and they don't
allow them extra fancy grips
grip so i had to
whip some out real quick in my shop the
night before
i was going to assass shoot so

they're just like the factory wooden
grips i still have those too i just
couldn't find them the day
