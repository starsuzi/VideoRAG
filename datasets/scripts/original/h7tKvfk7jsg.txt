welcome my name is Chef Mark Allen I'm

I'm going to show you how to easily cut
and prepare acorn squash all you'll need
is a large chef knife a smaller chef
knife for peeling and I'll show you a
quick and easy way to use an ice cream
scoop to make this a simple preparation
we start by slicing a small section off
the bottom of the acorn squash and again
this is simply to give you a nice flat
spot to work
with we're going to cut both ends
off both the top and the
bottom we going to take our larger
knife and again just simply invert it
down into the
squash pushing down
to where the tip touches on the board
and push down see how nice and easy that
is turn the squash around put it back
into the same position again back into
the cutting board where it just touches
The Cutting Board hold the
squash give it a nice little move
down squash will pop right open see how
easy that is take your ice cream
scoop always start at one end or the
other that's how squash
grow give it a quick little turn
and it'll
pop right
out to peel the squash
then simply take the smaller
knife and just work it all the way
down you'll lose just a little bit of
squash but that's
okay there'll be a small amount left
over and we're just going to go back
through and trim that up real quickly
just from the bottom
let's get all those little pieces
off and our squash is ready to be cubed
or sliced or
paired for whatever application whatever
recipe is coming up next so you can use
this simple technique for everything
from the small acorn squash to even the
large pumpkins thanks for watching I'm
