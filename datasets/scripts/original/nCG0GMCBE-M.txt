alright this is my latest way of doing
steaks check it out y'all I got the two
burners under on medium heat these
things this comes out off just a t-bone
steak
crank it up a little bit here
we want to let it go about three minutes
and then flip it now waiting for the
girl to heat up I like it

bring it back here when I want to flip
it I just flip this turn it 180

it but it happens thanks for watching
