Welcome to our artbeads.com handy tip
today we're going to show you how to use
ice resin ice resin should be used in a
well ventilated room please be sure to
follow manufacturer's
recommendations the ice resin kit comes
with mixing cups and mixing sticks
additionally we found the following
items helpful a paintbrush tweezers
scissors a small sponge and a Needler or
pin for popping
bubbles in order for the resin to cure
properly you will need use at least a/4
oce of both the resin and the hardener
if the item you're working on is small
you may want to have multiple pieces
ready to make the best use of your resin
from the time you mix the resin it is
usable for 30 minutes after that it will
begin to set and must be
discarded natural drying or setting time
is best in a dust-free area you can
cover the pieces with a box to prevent
dust settling it takes approximately 24
hours at 72° which is the optimal room
temperature for mixing resin any cooler
and you will have difficulty stirring
and removing
bubbles curing time is 3 days if you
need to speed up the process use a
toaster oven set at 85 to 90° for 12
hours or 120 to 130° for 2 to 3 hours
for curing if you use paper in your
design we recommend coating the paper
with Mod Podge or other sealer this will
prevent the paper from bleeding or
forming water spots place the piece on a
level protected work surface if you're
working with a ring support the ring so
that the frame is
level if you're using paper in your
design cut the paper to
fit apply a coat of mod podge or other
sealer to both sides of the paper and
allow it to dry
completely you will need to apply a
second coat and allow it to dry
completely as
well
we have prepared this one in
advance apply a coat of mod podge to the
inside of the
frame position the paper and gently
press and smooth it to remove any air
pockets
apply another coat to the surface of the
paper and around the
edges and allow it to dry completely
before pouring the resin cut the tips
off the dispensing caps and put them
onto the resin and hardener
bottles pour a/4 Oz part a resin in one
cup and a/4 O Part B hardener in the
other cup it is important to have
exactly equal proportions of the resin
and the hardener in order for it to cure
properly which is why we use two mixing
cups pour the part B hardener into the
part a resin
use a stir stick to gently fold the two
parts together mixing
well the less aggressive you mix the
fewer bubbles you will have mix for 2
minutes the mixture should look clear
and no longer
streaky once the resin is mixed you have
30 minutes before it starts to thicken
because of the thickness of the resin it
tends to Mound as as you pour it and
then it settles making it easy to
overfill the frame pour the resin slowly
into the frame or use a mixing stick to
drizzle the
resin make sure that the piece is still
Level after you pour the
resin
use a needle or toothpick to pop any
bubbles or gently tap the piece to coax
the bubbles to the surface bubbles can
hide under paper or components use a
toothpick or mixing sticks to press on
the paper and components to re release
any
bubbles allow to dry for 24
hours placing the piece under a task
lamp will help the bubbles to rise if
you want multiple layers in your design
fill the frame part way let the resin
dry for 24 hours
then add the next layer of components
for smaller components you use a
toothpick or tweezers for better
control mix up a new batch of resin and
pour on top of the first layer fill just
until you have a slight Mound let the
resin cure completely before
wearing for these and other great tips
