foreign
got a video a lot of people ask me how
do you cut a straight line with a jigsaw
because you know the blades so fine and
it's kind of hard to do for a lot of
people but one way you can do it
plain and simple if you got a good
straight edge you know if it's metal or
whatever as long as you got a straight
edge
you can take and lay it down
and if you have some clamps around you
can take the clamps
and
clamp it
however
far out you want it
but you do gotta when you do that you
gotta compensate
for the width from here to there so
when you're cutting that
I'll go ahead and try to cut one here
real fast like I got it laying here
thank you
[Applause]
but when you're doing that you get a
pretty good straight cut on it it may be
off a little bit but you could take a
sander and kind of sand it a little and
straighten it back up so
but that's one way you can do it
another way is
to buy one of these hair guides that you
can slide into your
part here where it's got these grooves
it'll just slide in
and you fasten it down to wherever you
want it and it goes along with it and
you can cut a straight edge
but at least here you can get I think
around 15 or 20 dollars off Amazon or
you can get them at Home Depot in places
like that I do believe
or maybe even your local hardwires might
have them
but that's two ways that you can cut
straight edge
with a jigsaw and the same thing works
on the skill saw you can do it the same
way and get a good straight edge with it
