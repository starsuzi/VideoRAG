 
Hello, Namaste
salaam Walaikum, sat sri akal
Welcome back to another session
with your vahchef at vahrehvah. com lets go to the funda
behind anda today egg is called anda in hindi
egg in the kitchen are sometimes like potatoes they are the
ultimate versatile cooking ingredients as a bachelor
sitting in the night cramming for my culinary exams I used to get hungry
and raid the fridge, it is amazing think about it usually there are
300 things stuffed in there and if you want a quick snack
I bet your eyes will  first wander to the humble egg
eggs like potatoes can be made into million of
things hard boiled, scrambled fried
countless different omelets they can be use for snacks
on tray, desserts and I know tons of people
who get utter pleasure eating them raw
don't try that if your susceptible to salmonella bad eggs
are notorious carriers always cook eggs
because the protein in the raw egg are only 51% bio available
where as a cooked egg is nearly 91% bio available
in plain English it means that the protein of cooked egg
is nearly twice as absorbale as a protein
from raw eggs okay enough stories lets learn
to make these delicious egg in tamarind sauce which is also called
egg puli in Tamil and egg pulusu in Andhra. The term
pulusu usually mean that in Andhra Pradesh they will kill to eat this dish
It is the egg in a mouth watering tamarind sauce
to prepare this awesome egg curry you need
boiled eggs. Now remember one thing
make sure you boil your eggs not more than
10 minutes in hot water if you cut open your egg
the egg yolk should be yellow in color if you cook your eggs
more than 10 minutes there will be a reaction between Iron
and sulphur in a egg and causes blue ring
so just boil your eggs to the right time so you do not have those blue rings
Fenugreek seeds
coconut powder, coriander powder,
cumin powder, mustard seeds
red chilli powder, coriander leaves
turmeric, ginger garlic paste
freshly squeezed tamarind juice soak your 
tamarind for 15 minutes
in Warm water you'll be able to squeeze out the tamarind juice
salt chopped green chillis and
curry leaves, cumin seeds and
whole red chilli, finely chopped onion
to prepare this egg curry
pour some oil into a thick pan
add some
mustard seeds when your mustard seeds crackle
add some red chilli and cumin seeds
and add some
fenugreek seeds do not add lot of these as this can make your
curry bitter
add chopped onions
add little salt
salt helps by  removing the moisture from the onion and cooks it faster
while your onions are getting cooked add
curry leaves and chopped green chilli
now when you're onions are slightly brown
add little turmeric powder
and add ginger garlic paste
cook for few more minutes and then add little water to your
mixture
now add cumin powder
and coriander powder
the process  of adding little powder
just before you on add your spices
helps them evenly cook
and not burn add
some coconut powder at this point of time
and add some chilli powder
now we will add the main ingredients i.e. tamarind juice
to this mixture
and you can add also some water now when your sauce is cooking
add small amount of sugar lot of vegetable preparations which are
cooked in tamarind sauce
you always add little amount of sugar that brings
nice taste to your sauce. Now
I can add little more salt
after you add all the ingredients and
tamarind juice simmer it for like 15 minutes
in a slow flame
what this does is the tamarind juice get nicely absorbed by
onions and all the other ingredients in the sauce
check your seasoning,
taste and then you can add your boiled eggs
do you remember
that i have told you do not boil your eggs for more than 10 mins
If you want that eggs to observe moisture what they do is to find and slightly put
small cuts on the egg, so now if you see
the egg is opening at all sides and just put your eggs in it
and
now let it simmer for not more than 3 minutes and you can finish of your
preparation by sprinkling some nice
finely chopped coriander leaves try this
puli or pulusu with mudda pappu
i.e. mudda pappu  is just basically boiled
yellow dal with some seasoning it is a great
combination
because a light dal goes with a nice tangy
spicy egg curry. so
what do you say you dont know what mudda pappu is'that means
you not checking my website often
