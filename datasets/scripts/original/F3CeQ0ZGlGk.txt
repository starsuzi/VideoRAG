hi my name is christina gavindo with
domesticfelicity.com and today we're
going to talk about how to make paper
pressed leaves pressing leaves is really
easy and a lot of fun to do with
children you can find all sorts of
leaves from nature walks to in your own
yard find the leaves that you want to
press
have some paper towel or tissues
and then a large book
we're going to open up our large book
towards the back
take the paper towel and this will keep
the book from
getting stained by the leaves but also
help draw out moisture from the leaves
we're going to lay our leaves
in the book how we want them pressed
fold the paper towel over
and close the book making sure your
leaves are all the way in the book
there you go your leaves are being
pressed in about two to three weeks
they'll be ready to take out and either
decoupage or put in a scrapbook
thanks so much for watching my name is
christina and today we talked about
paper pressed leaves
