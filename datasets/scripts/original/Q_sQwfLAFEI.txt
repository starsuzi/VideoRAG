hi this is Sandy and I just wanted to
share an idea with you today on how to
get that wax whatever it is off of your
lemon without using soap or anything
else I don't know what people use I just
tried and I just got fed up because I
love lemon water but I don't want
whatever they put on this lemon in my
drink so I came up with an idea that you
just cut off the ends of your lemon use
one end or both of them the inside
part because you don't want to wack put
that wax from the outside on it you want
to use the
inside and you just scrub your lemon
with that in
and when you're done you don't feel that
wax it feels
nice so if you enjoy lemon water and
putting your lemon inside peeling
all try this try this it makes a big
difference thank you
