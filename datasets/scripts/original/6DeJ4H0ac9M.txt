hello I am megalon of mhd design and I'm
here to show you how I line any pieces
of garment that are open all the way
down either on the front or in the back
this is uh the dress from my pattern
s and um I'm showing it uh where um I
have assembled the front and the back
and uh attach the sleeve for the dress
and the lining so uh here I go
you take your dress you line it I rarely
pin things down because in dog
clothing um the pieces are so small and
I prefer placing it as I go so you start
by doing the sleeves
ham always make sure you follow your qu
in seowens which follows my foot here as
just a native an in sticking
up
and then I place it I do the
Hem
when I do
Corners it's an old trick that my
grandmother showed me is that you need
to do one bias Stitch to make the corner
breed they say snipe that and then new
turn
again it's another corner so I'm going
to do one by a stitch here then we going
to do the neck
hole matching the
seams
at the other
corner
matching my seam
here
and we do the other
sleeve then we the front
him
and um then I trim all of the seam in
half
and when I get to into a corner I clip
[Music]
it another corner I leave the neck hole
for a bit after because there's not a
lot of clippings to be done when it's a
curved
line to the other
sleeve and the next ho ho I trim in
[Music]
half and then I
do CP all the way to the seam every 1/4
in
it's always good to have scissors that
are very well sharpened all the way to
the
tips
okay
now for the part that is so difficult to
take pictures of or to explain is that
you have your dress that is attached to
the
lining and you want to close the sides
and you want to keep an opening and what
I mean by slipping the back into the
front or sometimes for coat it's the
opposite the front into the back you
need to open this here and slip the
front keeping always right side together
so you have your front that is turned
but you going to put
it I mean this was the back this is the
front you put it
inside and you have everything thing
line up close the in seam and the side
of the
dress so I'll do that side without the
opening because you do need only one
opening on one side of the lining so
what I do usually also for the
connection of the seam um in order to
lay flat you could push one seam allance
on one side and the other on the other
side so that uh reduces the bulk but you
can also push it all the way to the
lining side but that makes it a little
barier okay now always make sure you
have your qu in SE
atance and you're going to sew it and
it's going to make a whole loop around
from the lining to the
Dress
and um you see here it's the connection
of the sleeves and I'm going to do the
same thing with the seam allowances
pushing one on one side and the other on
the other side the sleeve always towards
the
sleeves
for
you have one side done and as you can
see it makes a whole
Loop now we're going to do the other
side leaving an opening in the lining so
where I am I'm opening the back side
through where the sleeve and the
shoulder
is and I'm passing it through slipping
in slipping it in the
front
going to start on the lining side push
same elanes each
way I'm going to back stitch because
it's going to be the opening and I don't
want it to uh onso
itself
[Music]
I
turn about 2
in and now before I turn it right side
out I need to trim all the seam in
half except for the opening it's going
to be easier to sew it close by
[Music]
hand the other side
for
so this is how it
looks of course when you do a coat the
sleeves are longer or sometimes you have
a hood but it's always the same
technique Now to turn it right side
out just go inside the
lining and you just
push
everything
sure that your Corners are really nice
and
square you can use a little corner
Pusher tool
too
so there you go
let turn right side
out you have your
opening now I'm going to go press it and
then I'm going to show you how I sew it
close with an invisible
stitch okay now I have my dress all
nicely pressed and this is the
inside with the opening you are I'm
using a red thread so you can see what
I'm doing but obviously this is supposed
to be invisible stitch so you're going
to use the same color thread as your
fabric you
start in the
seam P your KN
inside and then you do a Lea
Stitch of course the thread won't want
to incorporate there you
go
need to be careful not to catch
the dress fabric just need to catch the
lining
fabric
and of course when you do it with the
right color
tread it is is
invisible okay so now I'm at the end of
the opening
here we going
to do a
nut and then you're going
to go
inside so that you don't have a little
tread poing out
there you have it now you can do your
snaps buttons and
embellishments have fun sewing
