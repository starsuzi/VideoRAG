Hello guys!
welcome to another video
In this video im gonna show you how to clean your old blending stumps
basically we have two methods for recycling
first one is "using a knife"
and second one is "using a sand paper"
so lets try the first one
just hold your craft knife like this
and sharp your stump like a pencil
here you go!
our stump is ready for another round
I've already cleared the other side
so lets try the second method
which is "using a sand paper"
place your sand paper on a plain surface
take your blending stump and rub it on the sand paper
like this!
nice and clean results
i'll do the other side later
lets test the recycled blending stumps on a shading
its looking nice!
lets try the other one
Perfect !!
