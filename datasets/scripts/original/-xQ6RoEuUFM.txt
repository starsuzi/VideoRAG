now before we get started you might want
to think of some safety first you can
easily hook up a vacuum to the back of
your Jewel tool through the port or
simply wear a face mask to protect
yourself from any dust that might fly up
in the
air and here we have this amazing rough
amethyst and I'm going to show you how
to take it from the rough all the way to
a wet polished look I'll be using our
Flex diamond 250 Micron followed by our
micro finishing diamonds in coarse
medium fine and very fine to follow this
we take it to the premium diamond and
these are labeled Step 1 3000 grit step
two 8,000 grit and step three 50,000
grit I'm going to follow it in final
step with the serium oxide and now this
will ensure me that beautiful lab high
quality wet look and again just like you
see here I have the cushion pads all on
the back of these except for the flex
Diamond now remember these are the
cushion pads that adhere to the hard
backing plate you see just like a
sandwich and here we go let's get
started I grabbed the flex diamond mine
is not as clean and new as that but they
have a nice long lifespan so I run this
at medium high
[Applause]
speed and I want to take all this rough
[Music]
down
so from
here I'll move forward to either the
coarse or the medium at this stage
however the amethyst feels a little soft
so I might forego the course and use the
medium again medium to high
speed
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
you see how I rock it back and forth
instead of hopping around makes it
really easy and again since it's a
little softer I'll skip the fine and use
the very
fine just dip it in some
water
[Applause]
and
[Applause]
and that was again at a medium to high
speed now here is a good stage to stop
and look at your finish it's quite
polished so you might be able to forego
the 3000 grit and jump straight to the
8000 because it's quite almost polished
at this stage however I'm going to
continue with the
3000
just to show you the steps and here
you're going to have to run it uh at a
slower speed so I usually run
it and then I bring it down a
little so here we go now here at this
stage it's really important to
follow every
little spot on the stones and so I
usually mark it with a marker to make
sure I have it missed
[Applause]
anything
there and that pretty much is almost the
same finish I had prior but like I said
I could have skipped it and gone
straight to the
8,000 again running it at slow speed
with some
water you see how I teer Tau it like
rock it back and
forth now from here I can already start
seeing a Polish and for most Jewelers
some of this you know is acceptable and
that's enough but if you want to keep
going for a finer polish this is a
50,000 and this will start
looking more or less like that wet
look so you want to make
sure you get every
little
spot
oh my heavens look at the Polish on this
amethyst it's gorgeous now if you
thought that was polished the serium
oxide which is this white
wheel will take it to an extremely high
polished
finish now if you have any porous Stones
it's not wise to use the serium oxide as
the serium oxide sometimes as it
discharges that white uh serium it could
fill into the pores of the stone but you
know this amethyst clearly doesn't have
any pores so we're good to go let me
just slow it down just a bit add some
water serum loves
water and you can see that white slurry
right there that's actually the serum
that's been impregnated in the wheel
coming off and doing its
work so
[Applause]
[Laughter]
[Applause]
oh my
heavens look at the high polish wet look
achieved on this Amethyst from
rough to a high
polish in a mere matter of
minutes
