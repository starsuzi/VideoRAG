gonna teach you how to make an amaretto
sour the amaretto sour is not that
difficult of a drink to make but it is
quite delicious and many people do enjoy
it you're gonna need of course amaretto
and then also sweet and sour mix you're
gonna want to pour about an ounce and a
half of your amaretto into a rocks glass
roughly don't fill it up about halfway
you're gonna top it off with some sweet
and sour right there is a perfect nice
cocktail but if you want to garnish it
with something you could always add a
maraschino cherry for a little red color
and that's your amaretto sour thanks for
