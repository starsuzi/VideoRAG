hi i'm linda hutchinson today i'm going
to show you how to keep ribbon from
fraying
very often when you tie a bow on
something the edges start to unravel and
it just looks messy
especially if you're making something
that you're going to wear
so
one option that you can do is to cut the
ribbon
on an angle that tends to help it from
fraying
if you cut it like this
or
another option
is to fold it over like this
and cut it like that
so you make that kind of look
it will help to keep it from fraying
but sometimes it needs a little extra
help and so you can use
clear nail polish
and on the underside of the ribbon the
side that is going to be
on the back of the item
just gently
put a little coating of polish just
right on the edge
and when that dries that will keep it
from frying
thank you so much hope this was helpful
my name is linda hutchinson and have a
great day bye bye
you
