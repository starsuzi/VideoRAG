hi everyone and welcome to Niko's
kitchen once again to commemorate Anzac
Day we are making the quintessential
dish served on Anzac Day by Australians
and new zealanders we're making Anzac
biscuits
[Music]
so today a very very important and very
very Australian dish and New Zealand
Dish as well we're making Anzac biscuits
now Anzac biscuits I'm going to put a
link below so you can get the full story
but basically Anzac biscuits were made
by the wives of soldiers and then sent
off to them at the Battlefront now the
reason why they were sent off because
they can keep for a very long time but
not only that they taste fantastic so
this is what you're going to need you're
going to need some rolled oats okay
don't get the instant ones just rolled
oats okay because the other variety
won't work you're going to need some
castor sugar some butter some golden
syrup or trial if you've got it some
plain flour some B carb of soda and of
course some desic CED coconut right guys
like I said if you want to check out
what the Anzac biscuits and the history
is all about the link is below but let's
get
started okay so into a large mixing bowl
I'm going to add in our
flour our rolled
oats our
sugar and our
coconut and just mix those ingredients
well okay so in a saucepan I want to put
our
butter and also add our golden
syrup and guys just over a low heat melt
that butter and the syrup
down now guys with our baloda before I
put it in I just want to mix some water
in
there and just give it a
stir and now I want to add it into a
mixture but Watch What Happens
we get this beautiful
frothiness on the top and it smells
beautiful now guys this will keep our
mixture very very light and chewy and
soft now guys I want to add in our wet
mixture to our
dry and just give it a good
stir so that's what you'll end up with
guys this beautiful caramelly dough just
like that right let's get this on a
baking tray so on our baking tray just
roll the mixture into balls just like
that and then pop them
down okay so now we're going to flatten
them out so just get a jug of water put
a wooden spoon in there and then with
the bottom of the spoon just press down
now what the water will do is when it
comes in contact with the top it will
stop them from burning in the
oven okay so these boys now go into a
preheated oven at 170Â° and they go in
there for 15 minutes or until they're
beautiful and golden brown on the
top and there you have it guys they've
just come out of the oven they're still
warm I have let them cool on a cooling
rack though but I do like them soft and
chewy like that have a look at them
absolutely gorgeous so let's give this a
try m
I love my anac biscuits nice and chewy I
don't like them hard I like them soft
and just have a look at the give in that
beautiful all the ingredients are below
including the link to the Anzac Day
information you guys take care and I
will see you next time
