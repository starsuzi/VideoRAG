Hey guys. welcome to Nyonya Cooking!
This video is a special one because
it is in the playlist, Breakfast in Malaysia
Now, if you are interested on the types of food
that we have during breakfast in Malaysia,
remember to check out the link in the description box below
It will lead you to more recipes to the different types of food
that we have during breakfast
Now, for this video, I am going to show you
how to create a very special 'kuih'.
It is very popular among Malaysians
If you go out to the roadside stalls,
they will usually sell this 'kuih' which is also one of my favourite kuihs.
This is how to prepare curry puffs
I like to make this version
which is very simple and uses potatoes
and I am going to give you a few tips
to make sure that the curry puffs
that you create will be flaky
If you want to prepare these few weeks in advance,
you can even freeze them
I'm going to give you tips on that too
So, let's look at the ingredients that we will need
As I had mentioned, we have the potatoes as the filling
and I had already diced them earlier
Here, I have onions which are already minced,
curry leaves just to add the aroma,
garlic,
this is a bit of dried shrimps which had been pounded earlier
and we will have a bit of curry powder
For the dough, I'm just using plain flour which is just wheat flour,
oil and a bit of salt as well
While waiting for the oil to really heat up,
we're going to mix the salt and also the flour together
So, just mix it evenly
If you haven't tasted curry puff,
it is very similiar to samosa
I love samosa as well and if you are a fan,
you are going to love curry puff too
Once this is really mixed well,
we are just going to create a well in between the flour
and this is where we are going to pour in the hot oil
It wouldn't be wise to use your fingers to knead this dough right now,
so we are going to let it cool down slightly
As you can see, it's really difficult to make it into a dough now
because it crumbles
So we can add a bit of cold water. Remember to use really cold water.
By doing so, the temperature of the hot oil
and the cold water come together to create a dough
which will be very crispy when you fry it later on
You will find that the dough is very much more manageable
So, just knead it until it becomes a very smooth dough
There you go, the dough is ready and
we are going to leave it aside while we prepare the filling
So, using the same pan that we used to heat up the oil earlier,
I'm going to cook the potatoes
So, let's begin with the onions and then the garlic
When it is fragrant, add in the dried shrimps,
the curry powder and also some curry leaves
You can, of course use more oil to saute the ingredients
but I like to lessen the oil
because curry puff by itself is really very 'sinful' already
Now, I am going to add the potatoes
So, I'm going to add a bit of water just to simmer the potatoes
The goal is to cook them until they softened
and then leave it aside to be used as the filling
We're also going to add a bit of salt and sugar to taste
Now, once you see that it is almost dried up and the potatoes had softened,
that means it is ready
So, we are going to dish it up first
While waiting for the potatoes to be cooked,
I had already divided the dough into balls of 30 grams each
and I left them in the refrigerator
When you put it in the refrigerator and it's chilled,
then this dough is much more manageable
So, before you flatten the dough,
just dust your working table with a bit of flour
Try to make it as round as possible
but it doesn't need to be perfect, really
Once it is flattened to a thickness of 0.2cm,
we are going to fill it up
I like to avoid having curry leaves in the curry puff
but if you like, you can also add them
Some people add eggs to it,
therefore the dough would be very much larger
Press the sides to bring the dough together
All you are going to do now is to fold in the side to create the pattern
Push down, pinch the top and continue
There you go, I had already shaped them here
Now, if you want to freeze them, this is the time to do so
Freeze them like this on a plate with a space between them
Once they are frozen,
you can keep them side by side in a plastic bag or tupperware
If you freeze them together in a plastic bag in this texture/uncooked,
then the dough will stick together
and that is what you want to avoid
Now, we are going to deep fry these
Over here, I had already heated up a pot with some oil
To test if the oil is hot enough, just drop a bit of dough
The moment it floats, we can fry the curry puffs
So, we are just going to fry them until they are golden brown
and then we're going to bring them out
There you go, the curry puffs are finally golden brown and ready
Hmmm..... Oh wow!
My god, if I may say, this curry puff is really to die for!
Look at the flakiness of the dough
Added to that, there is this taste of potatoes in curry and they are soft
I love potatoes when they are soft
I love this recipe. You have to try this out
