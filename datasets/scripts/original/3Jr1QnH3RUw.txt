okay guys this is fairy fart
1981 um I just started to paint this
skull and then decided what the heck I
will try and do a tutorial on um trying
out some new clay and how it's going to
react to the acrylic paint I sculpted
this couple days ago and let it
completely dry and basically what I'm
going to do is play around with some
different colors um and try to bring out
all the details and cracks and stuff
first I'm going to go in with a
brown and
hopefully I
can sorry about all the camera
movement um I'm just going to go in and
paint
and get all the little
cracks that I have first and then I'm
going to go back and um dry brush with
an ivory color a white um and then just
play around with a mix of
colors so I'm going to probably
just stop this video because I'm sure
you guys don't want to watch me paint
and talk about
nothing um and I will come back after I
have it painted brown and I will show
you the next
step okay back to the video um I have
painted the skull um out of clay that I
sculpted I just wanted to show you guys
really quickly um
I use this air dry clay I'm kind of
playing around with it a little bit um
to see what different things I can do
with it um I want to eventually try and
cast in silicone but I'm not sure if
it's possible with this clay um but I'll
get to that
later so let me move this out of the
way
and here is the skull completely painted
in um the brown
paint and I've just got cheap uh paint
that I got from AC Moore I think these
were no more than a dollar maybe 60
cents um going to put a little Ivory
down a little bit of
brown
paint
booger come
on um in case you want I'm using the
brown is
Bittersweet the bonish color is Ivory
and then I've just got plain old white
and I'm just going to play around with a
couple
different um color combinations to see
what I like to get free bone look um I'm
using this
brush is a little bit of beat up that's
kind of the type of brush you want to
use it's just a brush that's really beat
up to dry brush and you're basically
going
to go into your color whichever one you
decide to
use um and then kind of tap it off on a
paper towel or a paper
plate and and then let's see if I can
get
in nice and
close hopefully this is a good shot for
you guys and then basically you're just
going to kind of go over a little
bit and start picking up
detail this is going to need probably
several coats of dry brush
but hopefully you can
see
that you're getting all those little
cracks and
crevices
um it Focus all the little cracks and
crevices are staying the dark brown
color that I initially began with and
then I'm going over with the lighter
color and it's just giving it a nice
light look at first first and like I
said I'm going to go along and play with
this
um one of the things that you have to
kind of watch out with um this specific
Clay is when you're painting with
acrylic
paint is it will pull off of the paint
will pull off of the clay um basically
all you have to do is go back and dab it
with a little bit of you know whatever
paint you decide to use you know your
base color and then go back over it I'm
going to stop the video again and I will
come back after I've dry brushed
this okay guys I'm back I um dry brushed
it with a very light coat of ivory
acrylic paint um I'm going to then try a
little bit of just plain white paint see
how that looks and then I might decide
to do some different color combinations
so you want to really kind of just have
a little bit dry Mo most of it off of
your brush so that it's just a very thin
coat and then you can let me try and get
this better on camera for you and you're
basically kind of
just for lack of a better term you're
kind of just tickling it on there just
very lightly
rubbing it on
um so that you're picking up the details
but you're not loading your brush with
so much paint that
um it's just going to completely
overwhelm the
piece then if you do that you can always
go back and um try and start back with
your um initial color and
then um start
again depending on what you're working
on that may or may not work um depends
on
the uh project that you're using it on
and this for me is just kind of an
experiment because I've not really tried
too much of this with um this specific
clay and paint I did one other piece
that came out really well but that was
just a complete trial and error messing
around with
it um so after I
get I don't know if you guys can tell
the color difference between the beak
and the top of the head and that's just
the ivory a little bit of dry brush and
then this is going over it with the
white I will
um another thing that you can do um if
you want try to rub back some of the
paint that you're uh you put on
this specific clay if the paint is too
wet um because it's a water-based clay
and you try to rub it can peel the paint
off um I'm going to stop it here and I
will come back in a minute or two and
show you guys what I've okay guys I um
went through and I dry brushed it with
white completely and I didn't really
like the way it looked um so then what I
did was I basically went over the white
with a little bit more of the ivory
color and I kind of like the way that
looks better um hopefully you can see
the color
differentiation between the two um
basically it's just playing around with
what you have and not being afraid to
give it a shot and try it and if it
doesn't come out you can always try and
fix it later um I'm just using this for
a Halloween uh
just decoration little thing that I'm
going to put on my table with uh some
Potion bottles and stuff that I did but
I hope this was helpful um if you guys
like the video that would be awesome if
you have any questions feel free and I
will try and answer them as soon as
possible thanks for watching
