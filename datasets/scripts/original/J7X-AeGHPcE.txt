hi guys and welcome back to my daily
cocktail Vlog today's going to be a
quick one I'm going to show you how to
make a Moscow Mule which is Oprah's
Favorite
apparently all right so what we want to
do is we want to measure out a double
shot of
vodka so 60
Ms and add that into your Moscow mu mode
which is this bad way right here and to
fill the glass with
ice then top with ginger
beer so ginger beer and ginger ale isn't
really interchangeable ginger ale is
just carbonated and flavored with ginger
whilst ginger beer is actually
brewed so top it up with ginger
beer might top that up with ice as well
and now we want to add some fresh lime
to it so you want 15 Ms it's roughly
about half a
lime so squeeze the lime juice into it
and then just add the spent lime into
the me
[Music]
mug and just give it a little bit of a
stir just to get that lime juice
through and there have a Moscow Mule
cheers baby baby yeah
oh oh
