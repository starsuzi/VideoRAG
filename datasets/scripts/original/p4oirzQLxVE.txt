It's on? Is it really on?
Today, I'm excited to inform you
I will be teaching you how to
make America's favorite dessert:

What? We're not doing
Dora, The Explorer's theme?
Oh!
I'm sorry. We're not doing Dora's
theme. I'm sorry.
You'll need
Last thing to add is
What is this?
They already get it. Thank you!
You'll need two eggs.
One whole egg will be used, 
and other egg- we need yolk.
This is an whole egg.
How do you seperate yolk and 
whites?
You'll need
Crack the egg using
the flat surface only.
Not on the rims of bowls
or pots.
Flat surface is 
recommended.
Why flat surface?
The egg will crack
cleanly, rather than
having bits of shells
in your egg. 
You don't want that.
The timer needs to be set up.
Are you ready, timer?
Where's the timer?
Guys? The timer?
Oh, there you are.
Keep on whisking for 30 seconds,
and then let it rest for 2-3 
minutes.
Repeat that 3 times, okay?
Ready?
[TICKING]
2 minutes break.
2 minutes are up.
Now, it is time to repeat.
Are you ready?
[TICKING]
The reason why we do 
30 seconds of whisking
and then pausing for 2-3
minutes, back and forth
for three times.
Hot butter.
Eggs.
When eggs are mixed with
hot butter,
the mixture will cook the egg,
making the batter more thicker
and thicker and creamy
which results in soft,
chewy,and easy to break cookies.
Delicious!
You can do it! Whisk!
Faster, faster!
Letting you know you're
running out of time!
Hey! Be patient! Wait!
Okay!
Second break is over. I'm
exhausted. My arm!
I don't need you right now.
No! No.

Oh! Now?!
[MOUTHING] - Water! Water.
All of that hard work paid off.
It smells delicious! Wow!
Remember when you combined flour
and baking soda?
Now is the time to use it.
pour it in the wet mixture.
Make sure you mix easily. 
Don't overmix it.
If you overmix it, your
cookies would be rock hard.
Make sure you mix it gently.
It called folding it in.
The most important ingredient
in chocolate chip cookies is,
Of course, the famous
chocolate chips!
You can choose variety-
bittersweet or semi-sweet.
I used semi-sweet.
Just continue folding
it in, okay?
The last step is place cookies
on sheet using what?
If you don't have scoopers in
your home, 
you can use your hands. Your 
hands are the biggest tool in 
your kitchen. FYI.
Check for even spaces around
the cookies, and then bake!
It reminds me of when my
grandma baked me cookies!
Now, you need to cool them. You
don't want to make then hard if 
you don't let them cool.
Behold! A mountain of chocolate
chip cookies!
This must accompany with what?
Milk, of course!
Can't wait to taste it!
