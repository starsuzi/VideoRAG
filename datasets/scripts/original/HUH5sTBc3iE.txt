hello and welcome back to another
edition of delectably different in the
kitchen and today we're making one of my
favorite breakfast treats baked oatmeal
and I know it sounds very simple but it
is delicious so let's get
started to start out we're going to want
to put 1 and 1/2 cups of rolled oats now
depending on if you're gluten-free or
not you're going to choose whether or
not you're going to have gluten-free
oats regular oats so we're going to just
go with 1 and 1/2 cups of your choice of
Oats now we're going to be adding in a
four of a cup of melted
butter we're also going to be adding in
one
egg a half a cup of
sugar and 1/2 a cup of
milk now we're just going to mix these
well together before we put our spices
in now here in this bowl we have a
teaspoon of cinnamon a half a teaspoon
of nutmeg 1 teaspoon of baking powder
and a teaspoon of salt so we're just
going to put that all
in and we're also going to put in 1
teaspoon of vanilla
extract now that we have all of our
ingredients mixed well together we're
going to put it in a prepared grease 13
by9 pan and we're going to actually make
sure our oven is preheated to 350 so do
that ahead of time

now we're just going to pop this in the
oven for about 25 to 30
minutes all right now we have our baked
oatmeal out of the oven we've quickly
warmed up some milk because that's the
best thing to add on top of this we're
just going to scoop out some of our
delicious baked oatmeal just be generous
I said throw it in a
bowl now my favorite part is you can
have as many types of toppings if you
want of course we want to add in some
brown sugar some apple golden
raisins and then we're going to be
adding in our warm milk and this just
makes it a gooey delicious and yet
sometimes a little bit
crunchy my favorite part we get to eat

cinnamony warm toasty and delicious so
