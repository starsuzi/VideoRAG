something like that on the spot I need
time to Annie yes Tammy you know what I
have a question for you yeah when I'm
going to the grocery store yeah I never
seem to have the bags I'm spending so
much money on these stupid bags I it's
really a problem for me do you can you
have any advice you know I do as a
matter of fact you know these cops here
in South Africa right and so I tried to
save them and I would stuff them in my
bag and then it it just was not and I
ended up throwing them away but then I
discovered this handy little
trick you can fold this bag to look like
this no way yes way show us how so that
it's just it fits right in there nicely
here everybody grab a
bag now you're going to make it flat
like just
even have some nice red Christmas bags
red and green oh ho ho
okay once it's laid out nice and flat
you're going to fold
it
one
two three
times and you'll start with the end kind
of like a paper football yes okay
yes exactly and make a
triangle or the American flag
yes yes and just keep folding
it what do you do with these pesky ends
Annie I will show you that's the cool
part when you get to the
end you should have a little pocket like
that that you can just tuck it
over so you just tuck it in right here
yeah
my ins a little short could I just could
I just tuck them over one of the corners
you
could wow my life has changed thank you
Annie I'm so glad it's a pleasure Tammy
[Laughter]
okay cheesiness fact aren't you said you
weren in that thumbs up is the best part
no we really needed like 1950s aprons oh
shoot I had an apron oh well but it
wasn't it wasn't 1950s no that's true it
was a very cool apron
