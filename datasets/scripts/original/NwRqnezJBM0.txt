you all know the Dilemma you've got
friends coming over to play a game of
bridge discuss the latest gossip and of
course your pension plans what do you
make them a beautiful moist coffee cake
with an Irish Cream lure glaze it is so
simple and it starts off in the mixer
with some butter and some sugar creaming
it up to make it totally delicious so in
goes our softened
butter and in with quite a bit of castor
sugar you want this to be creamed up
until it turns nice pale and Light
now I know I've mentioned pensions and
Bridge and the reason I do is because it
kind of reminds me of a bit of a retro
dessert this is a fantastic retro
dessert because we're going to bake it
up in a bunt tin you can get these in
most baking shops but if you didn't have
one of these you can do it in a cake tin
now in on top of our butter which has
now been creamed with the sugar I'm
going to add six large Freer range eggs
as soon as you've got that last egg in
there it's time to get in there with
your dry ingredients so some flare go
straight in here and try not to get it
all over the mixer like I am if you do
it's not the end of the world give it a
good
mix so once you've got your flour
Incorporated just start folding through
the sour cream and the
milk make it rise as well we have some
baking soda going in and I'm going to
start off with half this milk
now when you're making this you need to
make sure that your tin is lined with a
little bit of butter and some flour just
to make sure that it comes out nice and
evenly and you're looking for a really
smooth mixture
here so I'm going to transfer half the
mixture into a bowl and this is where
this gets a little bit exciting because
my wonderful bunp cake is going to have
a swirled interior so to do that
transfer half this mixture into a
bowl I'm going to add a tablespoon or
two of some coffee extra
ract and just to give it a really rich
flavor I've got some pheny Irish Cream
lure so about a tablespoon goes in here
this will give a lovely sort of chocy
Rich intense taste in here and just give
it a good mix
up okay that's ready to go so now it's
time to fill this wonderful cake so
start off with one layer of the batter
in the bottom of your cake
tin another layer going in here and you
can see it starts to look really
interesting cuz you've got the different
colors going on and now just keep
alternating the different colors until
you have a lovely filled cake
T you're going to get left with a
beautiful moist and dense coffee
cake so get in there with the spatula
and just swirl this
through now that I have a beautiful
marbled cake this goes into the oven for
quite a long time 55 minutes remember
we've got a lot of moistness going on
here so this goes in for 55 minutes at
180Â° C to cook on
up as soon as your cake is cooked make
sure to take it out of the oven allow it
to cool and take it out of its cake tin
and put it on a lovely cake stand now it
looks pretty good it looks pretty nice
but we're going to finish it off with a
beautiful Irish Cream lure glaze so into
a bowl sift in some icing sugar in on
top of your lovely sifted icing sugar
we're going to go in there with a
tablespoon of this F's Irish Cream
lure and finally just to loosen it out
and give it a really rich dark color
I've got some coffee Essence so about a
tablespoon going in here
again this is coming together
beautifully and if it is looking a
little bit thick as it is now just
loosen it out with a bit of extra
water it's drippy it's gloopy it's
looking beautiful it's time to get on
our
cake now for the finishing touches give
it a bit of a drizzle give it a bit of a
pour and look at
that the final little touch once you've
got your lovely bunt cake swirled is
some edible gold stars now you don't
need to use these but they look so good
over the top so a nice little
sprinkle check it out look at that this
is what it's all about this is why you
do it you get that lovely moist swirl
running through it and if you you think
I've said moist quite a lot in this
video I want you to leave me a comment

times I've done it now it's time to dive

cream lure in there is so good it's Rich
