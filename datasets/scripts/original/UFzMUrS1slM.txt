hi everyone welcome to easy recipes with
twist.com my name is Victoria pin and
today I'm here with my friends at
recipe.com who asked me to produce a
video on those Beauties those are um
Kofa kebabs loaded with lamb and spices
and the house smells amazing amazing you
just have to do it and you know in order
to make it you have to stay
tuned for this recipe you will need 1
lound of uh ground beef extra lean and 1
lound of a ground
lamb salt Ken pepper a coriander seed
ground
paprika this is uh cumin ground cumin
cinnamon parsley and a lots of garlic
really lots lots of
garlic yeah and I forgot of course black
pepper take your meat and add the garlic
in at least six gloves of garlic you can
add
more now add
parsley and let's start to add spices
season with
salt
paprika a lot of paprika about two
teaspoons
wo cumin half a teaspoon don't overpower
cumin is too bright and too Vivid in the
food and it can over power all the other
flavors so be careful with this one
black
pepper Ken use at your discretion if you
like uh really spicy add more if you
don't just pinch will be more than
enough now add coriander
seeds about a teaspoon and half a
teaspoon of cinnamon mix all very well
with your hands
okay let's take our skewers metal
skewers are classical for this
recipe and you see it should be flat one
like this one but if you have round one
like this it will work
better and if you have a wooden one you
can use those but preferable flat
one take your meat and uh form sausage
like um formation or how you call
it put it in the middle and start
working it around
the
skewer like
so do one huge one and be sure that it
won't foil like this
you see it's huge one I love this this
way but you don't have to do this huge
you can do couple of smaller ones it
will be absolutely okay so I'm doing to
second
one pop on preheated uh Grill to medium
high
heat 4 minutes later pop to the other
side and let it cook for another 4
minutes if they are too large you can
cook them for 30 seconds on the sides as
well if not you can take them out and
they are already done and
beautiful let's try our creation it's
still warm
