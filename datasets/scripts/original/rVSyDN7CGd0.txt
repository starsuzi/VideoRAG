How to Make S’Mores.
The hot dogs are all eaten and the fire is
still crackling.
It’s the perfect time to make some delicious
s’mores.
You will need Marshmallows Chocolate bars
Graham crackers A wooden stick or metal roasting
fork A campfire Strawberries and a microwave.
Step 1.
Prepare your graham crackers by breaking a
long one into two equal squares and placing
them side-by-side.
Step 2.
Then take a piece of chocolate and lay it
on one of the squares of graham cracker.
Place that on a plate and leave it in on a
rock or another convenient place near the
fire.
Step 3.
Toast your marshmallow by placing a large
marshmallow on the end of a long wooden stick
or a metal roasting fork.
Hold the marshmallow over the red embers of
the fire.
Turn the stick until the outside of the marshmallow
is golden brown and just starting to get mushy.
S’mores can also be made in the microwave.
They aren’t as good, but it’s much faster
and you don’t need a fire.
Step 4.
Take your toasted marshmallow—still on the
stick—and lay it on the side of the cracker
with the chocolate.
Now take the other half of the cracker and
cover the hot marshmallow, pressing down firmly
enough to pull out the stick.
Step 5.
Let the hot marshmallow sit for about 30 seconds,
long enough to melt the chocolate and cool
off a bit.
For a classy variation, add a strawberry to
the marshmallow when toasting and then follow
the same steps as before.
Name it something French-sounding, like “S’mores
à la fraise.”
Step 6.
Now squish the s’more between your fingers
and eat it.
Make sure to lick the goo that slides out
the sides.
