hi I'm Holly Silva and I've been a
crafts expert for 15 years today I'm
going to show you how to add glitter to
container candles so what is a container
candle a container candle is this
basically any candle that is already
contained any candle that is already
coming in some sort of a jar or some
sort of other like really cool container
or not cool container just a container
period
boom okay now what we're going to do is
add glitter to it first what you want to
do is melt it down how do you melt it
down well fill a pot with water of
course you don't want the water to go
any higher than the candle but fill a
pot with water stick the candle in the
pot you're going to get it nice and
boiling you're going to boil this candle
down until all of the wax is completely
liquid okay now that we've done that
we're going to take some
glitter and we're going to just pour
this glitter into the candle some of
it's going to fall to the
bottom actually most of a lot of it will
fall to the bottom which is
fine but you're going to put a bunch
okay you're just going to put a bunch up
here
because as the glitter weighs
down it's going to to fall on its own
and it's going to harden
okay so you're going to see that as it
hardens your glitter is going to stay
right where it
should
okay now we're going to take some ice
cubes we're going to stick the ice cubes
into the
wax now the water while it
cools is going to separate from the
wax meanwhile allowing the
glitter to fall where it
should and it's not going to be stuck at
the top or the
bottom add some more ice cubes we really
want this to cool
down make sure that your Wick stays at
the
bottom
now as you could
see wax chunks are
forming which is great because that
means that the ice is doing exactly what
it's supposed to be
doing and if you can see
here let's pull our Wick
out there
is quite a bit of water
surfacing as you can see
here I'm can pour some of that water
out once this is done this is going to
be a lot of fun to look
at now you're going to take some
tissue and just press
in the
candle and this is going to help remove
any moisture that Still
Remains
we want to be able to
see all of the really cool glitter that
we added to
it now you can add any color glitter of
any type
even add some shapes maybe even some
confetti glitter some stars or hearts or
anything like that depending on the
occasion maybe it's a holiday or maybe
it's a birthday or something I don't
know you know better than I do what
you're doing I just show you how to do
it if you have any questions on this or
anything else please do let us know that
is how to add glitter to a container
candle see you next
