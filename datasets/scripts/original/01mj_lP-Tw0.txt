okay folks remember when I had that
American Eagle incident about a month
ago when the power went out and I banged
myself up and it sucked and I hurt and
everything well I finally uh got the
email back before and uh from Park and
received compensation sorry for the
inconvenience two exit passes skip the
Line pass or and the flash pass whatever
yeah the flash pass but at the same time
they're not for good for Goliath I mean
I think what we endured that time it
should have been a lot on Goliath but
hey either way that's cool
