hey y'all hey amanda here and today i
wanted to share with you guys a very
simple candle decorating craft
so you will need a candle modge podge
tape glitter a paper plate and a surface
to work on off camera i went ahead and
taped off the area that i wanted to have
the glitter on
it takes a little bit of time to get the
line straight
so um just take your time and don't get
too frustrated with it
next i applied a even layer of mod podge
around the area
that i wanted glitter to be stuck to
make sure it's not too thick or too thin
i found the best way to get the glitter
onto the candle was to
roll the glue covered area in the
glitter at first and then
tap afterwards because that helps
make sure the glitter is really sticking
to the glue and it gets all the empty
spots too that it maybe missed the first
roll
the glitter wipes off of the unglued
areas pretty easily
the final step is super satisfying you
get to peel the tape off
make sure you away from the glitter so
that you don't accidentally
peel any off that you don't want to and
it should look pretty cool
here's the finished product i hope you
guys like it be sure to let it sit and
dry for a while
subscribe and like this video i'll see
you guys later bye
