how to grow Holly
Hawks Holly Hawks are generally
considered the bial they grow leaves the
first year and flower seed and dye the
next however depending on growing
conditions and the hardiness of the
plants they frequently live longer than
2 years in some climates they are more
of a
short-lived perennial if you start Hol
Hawks indoors or if you live in an area
with a long growing season there is a
chance you could get flowers the first
year
steps one purchase Holly Hawk seeds in
your choice of variety and color
Holly hawks come in an assortment of
shades of white yellow pink maroon and
red flowers which grow on six to 9t 1 8
to 2 7 m 1 8 to 2 7 m stalks Holly Hawks
will Reed themselves for subsequent
growing years you can also harvest seeds
from
plants in the
fall two increase your chance of firste
Bloom start Holly Hawk seeds indoors in
the fall germinate the seeds in October
or November and allow them to grow for a
while and experience a winter this may
trick the flowers into blooming the
following
spring three sew the seeds in trays full
of sandy soil
Holly Hawk seeds are large have a high
germination rate and come few to a
package so it is best to plant each seed
individually put each seed one 4 to 1 2
in0 5 to 1 cm below the soil place the
trays near a window where they receive
sunlight water the soil as needed to
keep it moist Holly Hawk seeds usually
germinate in 1 to 2 weeks
four transplant the Hol Hawk seedlings
into individual 4 to 6 in 10 to 15 cm
Bots if you started seeds in
Fall keep the putts in a Sunny Spot and
allow the Hol Hawks to grow indoors
through the fall and winter
five plant the Holly Hawks outdoors in
the spring after all signs of frost have
passed and soil temperatures are at
least 50° F 10°

Hawk seeds directly in the ground at
this time if you did not start plants
indoors six choose the right
location although Holly Hawks can be
grown in a number of climates and
environments your plants will Thrive if
your garden provides them what they need
most find an area that receives full
sunlight Holly Hawks can tolerate
partial shade as long as they get
at least six hours of Sun daily but the
flowers may be smaller and the colors
not as vibrant pick a sheltered spot
because Holly Hawks grow so tall they
Tower above many garden flowers making
them more vulnerable to winds and
precipitation plant them near
a wall tucked into a corner of fencing
or in a garden with other flowers of
similar height for best
results seven enrich the soil with
organic compost if needed
Holly Hawks do best when grown in rich
moist
soil eight space Holly Hawk plants 12 to
24 in 30 to 61 CM
apart nine mulch this oil around the
plants with 2 to 3 in 5 to 8 cm of
organic
matter the mulch helps to keep the soil
moist provides a weed barrier and
creates an environment for seeds to
burrow into in the fall for spring
germination 10 water Holly Hawks
regularly water them daily while the
plant s are getting established then
water twice a week for the rest of the
growing season whenever rain supply is
inadequate 11 stake the flowers or tie
them up with twine if they become
topheavy or are having trouble
standing tie the flowers Loosely to
allow for good air circulation
12 continue to water the plants after
they are done
blooming seed pods on the stalks are
still nourishing and Growing Seeds for
next year's
flowers 13 harvest the seed pods when
they turn brown and are completely
dry pick the pods and separate the seeds
from the thin dry husk or leave the pods
on the plants and they will dry and open
dropping seeds for
propagation 14 plant or store the Hol
Hawk
seeds you have three options plant seeds
the same area of the garden if your
Holly Hawks did well in that spot or
just let them fall off the plant to the
ground fall planted seeds will winter
over and germinate in the spring so the
seeds immediately
incede trays for indoor growing if you
want to start another cycle of indoor
Holly Hawks in hopes of first spring
blooming you could also store the seeds
in the refrigerator for outdoor planting
next
year 15 cut the plants down to ground
level and cover them with a layer of
mulch for winter
protection some Growers prefer to leave
several inches of the plant intact and
cover the stump with coal ash the ash
keeps moisture away from the stem and
discourages snails and
slugs
warnings Holly Hawk is prone to Leaf
fungal diseases such as powdery mildew
and drust water the plants from the base
and avoid Splash up onto leaves spray
the plants with sulfur or copper sprays
following manufacturers recommendations
for use if you see signs of
discoloration or malformation of leaves
