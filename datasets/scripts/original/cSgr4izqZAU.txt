Great, so you can use a vast amount of different
implements to fry at home.
I mean we obviously have the mother of all
fryers here, which commercially we use.
This, you can pan fry an egg and nothing else.
These two are perfect for pan frying.
You don't want to deep fry in them.
There's no sides to them.
It's very easy for the oil to spill out.
One very important thing is to use a good
quality pot.
If you use a $5, dollar store pot the heat
is going to be very, very uneven and you're
going to get very, very uneven results.
This is a stainless steel pot.
That's a Calphalon pot.
This is a thick commercial cookware pot.
These are all good to do deep frying in.
Just remember, never put oil more than halfway
full.
A third is probably as far as you want to
go.
The Chinese fry in woks all the time.
I much prefer a pot like this, just because
it's bigger.
It's safer.
You can drop stuff in and there's a lot less
chance having a problem in a big pot like
this, and you use more oil.
And what you can do, because oil is expensive
nowadays is when it's cooled down, keep the
oil container you had, pour the oil back into
the container and use it next time.
You don't need to throw it away.
So if you're really lucky, like we are, you
can use something like a rondeau, which is
very, very thick bottomed.
I mean basically with the pots you need a
thick bottom, because that gives very, very
even heat distribution, and that's what you
need.
I mean safety is number one priority with
frying at home, and the better the pot that
you use, the less problems you're going to
have.
You really want to wear long sleeves, because
if you get splashed, you want to wear shoes,
not sandals, because if it splashes and burns
your feet, it's incredibly painful.
I know because I've done it.
You want to wear long pants.
I mean really, you want to think like you're
arc welding, because it's the same sort of
heat.
At the end of the day, you want to eat good
fried food.
You don't want to be at the hospital getting
patched up with third degree burns.
