hi everyone so this is going to be
another review video on the 661 wrist
wraps
sort of braces
um so as you can see here they come in
this sort of black and light blue with
the sort of mesh on the side which helps
to keep you cool
but obviously they do add a little bit
more bulk because it's just something
extra to wear but i mean i definitely
didn't find them
didn't find them uncomfortable at all
when riding so that was definitely a
bonus
so basically i think i've worked out
about there's sort of three main reasons
why you'd sort of get these or what
you'd use them for
so
i think the first one is really to
if you've previously had an accident
where you've broken your wrist or just
had some sort of injury um then
obviously this is going to help give
support and yeah so you won't feel maybe
whether there's some pain that you've
hurt your wrist before
okay probably the second reason um which
is
one of the reasons why
why i have them is
so that it sort of prevents your wrists
from getting
sore
maybe after you know long rides when
you're on really bumpy terrain and i can
say they definitely helped me for that
you know like bumps
on tracks that i would feel before and
you know and it would really hurt now
you could just go flat out over them and
yeah no so definitely they really help
with
you know taking
taking some of the pain on bumps out of
your wrists and on long rides
okay and pretty much the third reason
why you'd get them is probably to
prevent again to prevent an injury but
this time probably you know when you if
you fall off and you you know you gonna
automatically
naturally sort of put your hands out
first to fall on so that's definitely
gonna help that as it will you know keep
them in place and
keep your wrists nice and well in the
position that they should be
um
so yeah as you can see here they've got
the sort of three velcro straps which
are really strong and but again you can
you can yeah really customize them to
your fit how tight or how loose you want
there's also a little sort of velcro tab
that you can sort of put over the um the
velcro
um like tab that's on your gloves to
really keep them sort of to work as one
um yeah
and yeah as you can see here
i can pull my gloves right over them
um which is really helpful and then you
can just put your jersey over them so
you can hardly you can hardly really see
them when you're riding
um
now obviously um there is the option of
getting these like proper customized
braces that someone like you know like
the pro riders wear but obviously that's
got like a huge price tag like knee
braces and whatnot um i got a super good
deal on these um they were i think they
were 7 49 each
so yeah worked out about 15
15 pounds
for the pair
um at chainreactioncycles.com and i'll
put a link in everything like that in
the description if you want to check
them out
um i definitely recommend these um i've
just found them yeah they've just really
helped my ride and you just feel like
you just yeah you just feel like you're
pretty much invincible
because you've got this extra protection
you can just feel like you can just go
flat out
so i definitely
definitely check them out
um
yeah so that's the 661 wrist wraps slash
sort of
braces
