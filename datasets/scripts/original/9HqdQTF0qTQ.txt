hi and welcome to the labs of Turtle Wax
today we're going to focus on cleaning
tires I'm going to be using Turtle wax's
new Platinum all-wheel and tire cleaner
with
wax now this is a high alkaline built
formula that's perfect for really
dissolving a lot of the breake dust and
a lot of the brown contaminants that
come out of the tire and dissolving them
making the tire look fresh and black
what I'm going to do right now is I'm
going to just saturate the tire
CLE and because we have dirty Fender
rolls I'm going to get them
too you want your car to look personally
detailed make sure you concentrate on
all the intricate areas of the tire and
the fender cuz it'll all look great now
what you're going to see right now is
you start to see a brown residue
starting to form that sub produ actually
penetrating into the rubber
and dissolving a lot of the breake dust
and also those sidewall contaminants and
it'll get right down to the fresh Rubber
and the carbon black to make your tires
look like like new now Platinum
all-wheel and tire cleaner actually has
wax in it so after you clean and rinse
your tire it'll actually have a nice
fresh satin shine so if you don't like
that high gloss look this is the product
that's going to work for you now you
want to wait for about 30 seconds for
this product to penetrate which I just
did and we're going to pretend that this
car was this tire was really really
grindy so we're going to use our scrub R
to help them move a lot the containment
then all you have to do right now is now
that we rubbed it in is just do a
WR and you can see all the black residue
coming right up and I friendy
wells look at that
nice TI cleaning isn't that hard just
get yourself in a regular regimen make
sure you follow these steps and you'll
wind up with perfect tires every
time
