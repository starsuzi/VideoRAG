okay a couple of these when I got them
in the jig
here couple of these are looking too
straight for me I don't like the I
really kind of forgot what was going on
up here they were it's just too straight
so I'm going to take them over to the uh
the actual bender and I might bend them
this way and then put another little
bend on them up top here or one of them
or you know maybe I'll leave one of them
straight and hit the other
two but uh they just don't they're just
too it's too much straight
up uh for me so all right I'm going to
take them over here and do that all
right I got them uh put together they're
not welded yet they're down in that
little uh base I made and they got Arrow
seals on them or hose clamps whatever
you want to call
them uh got to get the uh
tips roughly 120Â° I mean if you're
dealing with three things but it's like
I say this isn't rocket SCI you don't
have to be that particular about it I
just eyeball them if they look pretty
well even between them because you're
going to have them different also cuz
you got different bends you got two of
them that are bent one of them that's
straight so it's there it's not going to
be perfect but you can make it look good
plus it's a tree you know trees ain't
perfect anyway
so okay I wanted to show you some of my
uh before I get going here want to show
you kind of some of my uh clamps that I
made just to put you know kind of hold
the rebar a couple of older uh just ice
cre cheap Pittsburgh clamps from uh
Harbor Freight and I kind of put the
took a piece of pipe and you know welded
a piece of uh welded a piece of pipe on
the you know you got your rebar like
this you want to hold it you put your
rebar in there and it kind of holds it
or you can hold two of them you know if
this you got them on the ends all I gu
made one like this too where you can
hold it straight out like this you can
kind
of stick them all like
that it was almost impossible to try to
hold round stock with those flat pads
they just kept rolling off and
everything
so I got them tacked together now
they're kind of held in place so I can
take the arrow seals off and
uh Fe either finish up welding on them
or uh grinding or I'll stick this thing
on the ground now and we'll uh start
putting some branches on
them all right I'm going to start uh
bending the first set of bigger
branches uh so I just kind of put a Bend
here and then I'll turn it maybe give it
a Bend like that that gives you kind of
a you know half ass Branch effect you
know if you want to even now this one I
just did uh two bends on I put one one
way one the other way so I mean they
don't always have to be real compound
crazy looking bends you know you
can do them whichever way you
want got the three bigger branches on
it
um only thing I might do uh on this this
one it's got
the it looks like it's kind of a I put
it farther down here I want to get
something up in here it's kind of
open this looks a little better like
this
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
got all right
[Music]
cool
so there you
go I'll always have a good side and a
bad side like anything else but uh that
looks too
bad oh I was using those 611s there for
a while boy they really
dig okay pretty much got them uh
to the point of being done or as far as
all the branches on them uh what I got
to do
now is uh I'll go back now and uh turn
them over I go back now and hit all
these
underneath continue on to the next
step but that was about it I guess uh
other than you know putting every single
branch on I mean you didn't see that but
uh basically it's just kind of bending
the branches up and then sticking them
on
there piece of half inch round stock
come come out about like this long then
I got a piece of pipe that a half inch
fits perfect in it that'll get nailed
into the ground and you just slip it in
there so you can move them take it up
whatever it's it's easier than trying to
jam this into the ground especially
around here it's really not uh a lot of
places like out in my place you you're
not going to get farther than about that
much in the ground and you're going to
hit rocks so it's you almost need to
Hammer Hammer something in the ground
and then slip these into it so all right
we'll get going to the next
step okay this is going to be about the
last step here we got putting a piece of
round stock on it got the clamp we got a
clamped on there and uh got about 4 and
1/2 in here on it
[Music]
so
we got it going here we take
the clamer
off working with
these been working with these little
up
611s they're really
digging Tak a little Rod so I guess I'll
continue
here
all right there's
[Music]
[Music]
that hit them with the grinder
[Music]
machine close enough for retire man
[Music]
work all
right one more right
here right there one
[Music]
more
there you
go that's that now we just got to plant
them okay there you got it that's it you
got the uh 1/ in Spike wet on here can't
touch it it's still hot but then you
have a piece of pipe this is an old B
Rod but it's got a perfect hole to fit
the half inch on it you just Hammer this
into the
ground use some kind of a
spike but there you go amateur Bottle
