hey guys Jane Lee here today I'm going
to teach you how to wash your Navy dress
lights without destroying them so I'm
making this video for those of you who
wear this uniform
either every day or pretty often
basically you need to have your uniform
ready every day
you know looking good crisp cleaning
those stains which you should should be
like that if you bring that anyway but
you know some bags but anyway if
you need your unform
one you have to pay a lot of money to
you know you might have to wait a couple
days or pay extra to get it overnighted
it's a pain in the ass
sometimes a lot of guys didn't know it
you can actually wash it yourself which
I found amazing which is which is what
I'm making this video
so if you uh if you have any questions
after the video about how to do
something more detailed email me shoot
in the comment section below or uh you
know if you have another way that you
think is uh better or another way that's
easier let me know and uh something you
know little tricks and tips leave them
make your own Beauty response you know
any help is uh greatly appreciated so
thanks guys hope you liked it and hope
it works for you
so step one you have to pre-treat the
stands with some sort of stain booster
some sort of stain remover I use this
brand right here you know not trying to
do any product placement or anything
like that but it works pretty well for
me you guys can experiment with your own
I know the brand grease lightning works
pretty well
basement so
um yeah
got some random little
stands you know whatever so it's it's
impossible to keep this damn thing clean
with some more shoe polish themes on the
bottom there and you know my top I got
some stains up there by the collar and
by the cuff
just uh anything you see make sure you
preacher
ous
fake spray let it soak in for a little
bit rub it in if you need to
um it's pretty simple
Sloan had the message stated up
all right guys so I'm here in the
barracks laundromat all you gotta do
when you want to wash them right there
put it on hot wash hot cold setting hot
wash it's hard hard not to mess that up
you know if you're just washing them by
themselves which I recommend put it like
right in between small and medium
do this you need to put it on permanent
press normal
strand right here doesn't really matter
what soap you use and whatever you do
whatever you do
you do not use regular bleach do not use
straight chlorine bleach you will ruin
your whites
pure X2 bleach for colors and there's
Clorox 2 whatever brands of color safe
beliefs you want to use do not use
chlorine
make sure you do not put them on high
heat nothing like that you need to put
it on
a permanent fresh permanent press or
delicate
and under delicate or permanent press
put more than medium Heat and you don't
even need to drive honestly you can let
them hang dry
just
trying not to weave them in there for
like 10-15 minutes don't leave them in
there long enough otherwise it will melt
and it will look like all right
guys so the last step will be ironing
them once they're out of the dryer or if
you just hung them dry because they are
probably going to be a little bit
wrinkled um so I'll put out a video from
that so you guys know what to do that's
pretty simple but you know just in case
so if this video worked for you if your
whites turn out good go ahead and give
it a thumbs up much appreciated but if
it didn't work give it a thumbs down you
know I don't care I can take the
criticism you know what everyone needs
to work on some stuff so uh and like I
said if you guys have any more
suggestions leave them in the comment
section below otherwise take care guys
love you deuces
