Hi, I am Eugenie.
The other day I was reading The Importance of Being Earnest again 
and thought I had to make cucumber sandwiches soon. 
First, peel the cucumber with vegetable peeler 
and cut in three parts. 
And slice them. 
Today I keep the seeds but if your cucumber seeds are liquidy unlike mine, it’s better to remove the seeds for sandwiches.
Then spread softened butter on a sandwich bread. 
And season with salt and pepper.
Then arrange the cucumber slices over it. 
And top with another slice of (buttered) sandwich bread. 
Today I am using wheat bread but for tea sandwiches generally white sandwich breads are used.
Bon appetit.
I love simple and refreshing cucumber sandwiches with black tea.
“Please don’t touch cucumber sandwiches. They are ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.”
Thank you for watching. Bye for now.
