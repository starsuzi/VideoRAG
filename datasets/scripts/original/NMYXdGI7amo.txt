well here's the
deal a few days ago I bought this
vegabond there it
is vabon 14
sailboat I got it cheap
$400 but uh the reason I got this boat
so cheap is it didn't have a sale so I'm
going to make my own sale so I bought
some nylon awning
material
and here it
is I'm going to cut it to
the size 16 by 7 1/2 16t Loof give or
take an inch or
so and 7 and 1/2 foot foot well I cut it
off and I took the piece that I cut off
and I'm going
to sew it on the edge there so it's the
right shape well I think I'm done
cutting it
out I need a sale that's after it's all
done 16 by
72 this is the
material It's a cotton and it's a pretty
heavy canvas type stuff and I got yellow
to match first thing I'm going to do is
to sew this piece these two pieces
together that's the first thing I got to
do so I just
uh wanted to know because that's the
next thing you're going to see is that
sewed together I hope and sewn together
well I hope good morning giving you an
update on the salil
making um I seed
those two pieces together the big piece
and the little piece together I put two
seams on it I was about ready to put a
third seam on it but
then
this the foot pedal for my sewing
machine stopped
working well I just got rid of all this
stuff out of the way set it to the side
for a bit laid out the Mast and the boom
approximately where it's going to be
when I put the sail and up on the Mast
so when we come back I'm going to have
my sail laid out what I've got made so
far while waiting for the slowing
machine pedal so we'll see what it looks
like laid down on the
grass well there it
is laid out on the grass along with the
Mast and the
boom and it's
uh looking pretty close
to what I was trying to
make well it's been a few days or a
couple three I
guess since I last talked
to uh there's the sailboat I bought and
here's the sale and it's not completed
yet I still have to put the eyelets in
it this is uh extra canvas type of
material sewed where the eyelets will be
where the
uh so it'll be hoisted
from and
uh I put a layer of canvas all the way
around it just to make it stronger I put
some extra canvas right in this area a
lot of strain is going to be put on this
corner I might put some on this corner
too I'm not sure yet I don't know if it'
be necessary there's four layers there
should be okay but anyway there's my
main
sail lot of Shadows on
it get back here to get the whole thing
in but um basically the sale is made
just got to put the grummet the
eyelets for the uh sail sliders or sail
slugs I'll show you
those right now sail slider
I'll show you what this
does here's the
Mast sail
slider goes this in like
that and I got 15 of them I don't think
I'm going to use all 15 we'll see I had
to buy them packages of five 10 wouldn't
be enough for my taste but these will
slide right in
here when you Hoist the sail it'll make
it nice and smooth operation hello again
I just wanted to show you how I'm making
holes in here I was trying to figure out
how to get a hole in here with what I
have
so I'm putting that on and then I'm
going to put this
over and then I'm going
to use a propane
torch to burn it a little bit chart
chart and then flip it over and do the
same thing
and then it's soft enough use this drill
to just smooth it out hold is a little
smaller than the Gras it'll stretch out
it's better to make a hole a little
smaller than a hole too big so that's
how I'm putting the grumet in as you can
see I've got some in here already I've
got probably about half a dozen or
more and I'm just going to keep plugging
away so that's it little update show you
how I'm making the holes put the grummet
eyelet eyelets
in
well I I'd give you a little update on
the
sale I don't have the sail sliders slugs
in there yet got a few more things to do
but as you can
see I got all the
eyelets in it's a little windy out here
I can't leave that up very long but I
got the eyelets you see
the
eys and uh got to put those in sale
pretty good I wish it was a I wish I
had gotten it back another 6 in but hey
I'm
done
so the dagger
board and the rudder are made out of
wood most
some mahogany and whoever did a little
finish job did a really bad
job just it just you just see the how it
it would just drip down the side and dry
and big Globs it's horrible job of
refinishing the wood so I'm refinishing
the wood down the
basement I'll show you that next but
anyway just wanted to give you a little
view of the sail and I got the yellow
trim around it which matches the boat
really nice I think little droopy now
but when the wind catches up to it it'll
it'll be
fine so show you the dagger board and
Rudder next show you what I'm doing okay
here's the dagger board and here's the
rudder they put a finish on it was just
drips you can see big drip it was just
horrible job and uh so I stripped it and
just put refinishing it put some
polyurethane on there it's going to look
a lot
better so just wanted to give you an
update on
this and uh I think we're done with the
video thanks for watching bye
