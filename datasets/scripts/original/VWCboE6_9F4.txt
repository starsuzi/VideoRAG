[Music]
what's up guys garage floor
uh evolution part one
we have cleaned the garage floor with a
power washer that's sitting up there
next step is to clean it with chemical
stuff and then we will continue i will
catch back in
after every step but first clean garage
woah and luke
[Music]
all right ladies and gentlemen so uh we
have now used that cleaner
and cleaned the whole garage floor uh
the next step
is to get a putty knife and fill in you
guys can probably see
you guys can see all the cracks down
there we're going to fill in all the
cracks for the putty knife
and that'll be end of day one tomorrow
we will be
installing the uh rust-oleum rock solid
gunmetal whatever stuff but before we do
that we're gonna etch it obviously we'll
show you that whole process so
putty knife filling cracks done with day
[Music]
one
okay guys so uh we have now patched up
all the cracks
in the garage uh what we're gonna do now
is let this
dry overnight and into tomorrow morning
and then what we'll do is uh start the
etching process
which is just basically putting
chemicals down so
we will wipe to that footage now
that worked out pretty well though
what's going on guys welcome to day two
of the
annoyance every time i turn this camera
on uh so
this is day two of getting the garage
floor figured out so i've got the garage
like the rock solid stuff coming in the
mail later on
but while we're waiting for that i got a
circular
sander at a home improvement store
down the road and uh we are going to be
sanding down
all the concrete patching that we did
yesterday like it did a good job but
it's not smooth and there's also some
imperfections in the concrete that i
think we can just smooth other
over with the uh sander and that way
it'll have the concrete ready
so we can then etch it we've got all
that stuff that we got to do
and after all of that we can finally put
the material on so
first sanding
[Music]
so guys that's an example of some of the
little imperfections in the concrete
now there's more over here that i can
show you
so i did a little bit of sanding on
these guys and you can tell they're a
little smoother but i'm pretty sure
if i just keep sanding these guys down
we'll have a smooth surface
and then if you look over here there's
the sander extension cord
this material is way it's like perfectly
smooth now
versus here you have the rough edges so
we're just going to keep sanding this
whole thing
hopefully everything gets smoothed out
we got a lot of garage to do though
we have an update on grinding uh hold on
so for grinding the patchwork
150 does really good i've gone through a
lot of these pads but
this concrete has these little chunks of
pieces
uh to get those off we just grabbed 80
grit and this [ __ ] watch
little thing we got 80 grit on here
[Music]
that thing is totally freaking gone
oh man all right so if you guys have
little pieces of concrete on your floor
80 grit
[Music]
we have now sanded the entire floor and
uh looking back
no point in getting 220 grit sandpaper
here's what you get you get 150 and you
get 80. 150 is what you do your normal
stuff on and then if you want anything
off the floor get the 80 grit because
that stuff is amazing
uh the next thing i guess is to start
this etching process which
i don't know how that's gonna work so
let's see so since we're using a
rust-oleum product to put on the floor
i got rust-oleum etching stuff you're
supposed to mix this with a gallon of
water
and a flower pail just kidding everybody
on youtube had a flower pail so i wanted
to
follow suit you're going to we're going
to like pour this on the ground
in a 10 by 10 section scrub it it'll
froth up
then we're going to rinse that 10 by 10
section
i'm pretty sure there's four 10 by 10
sections back here
so once we get all of them done we then
have to rinse the whole thing three
times
i'm going to show you one 10 by 10
section and then we will skip full
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
do
[Music]
uh we have now rinsed with the power
washer
the entire floor so obviously we
squeegeed it out but it's still a little
wet
so what we're gonna do now is let it dry
because our rock solid stuff has still
not got here in the mail yet uh but
while we wait for that we're going to go
do more research
to make sure we are good to apply this
stuff
next so whenever the rock solid stuff
gets here i'll jump back on here and
update you then but so far
uh so good yeah and now i have extra
tools in case i
need things i guess i don't know okay
so uh welcome to day three of chase
waited three days for this rock solid
stuff to actually get in so today is the
actual
day we have cleaned the garage floor we
have
etched the garage floor all we should
have to do today
is paint this stuff on this is rock
solid
rust-oleum metallic floor coating
kit full name you're welcome thank you
one ac for turning off so
um you need a couple things to do this
this stuff comes with a lot of stuff in
it but
all right you need
you need a power drill one of these
things
i don't have a battery in it so that was
epically terrible
uh this is to mix the material
[Music]
these are too small don't buy these
anti-skid additive because
i don't want to slide two inch paint
brushes
three inch paint brushes now oh
and a long roller thing okay
we're going to start doing this stuff
now because we're ready to be done with
the garage board
okay so if you're watching the video
you've probably looked up what's in this
box
but for instrument purposes only
here's what's in it
[Music]
paint uh thing instructions
a stick this stuff already has etch in
it so you don't have to buy it i was
stooping did anyway
this is the color additive and this is
the crazy bag that you have to
toothpaste and pop and then shake for
two minutes
okay okay so you can see all the stuff
we have here we've got our anti-skid
stuff
we've got all our pouches um i ordered
five of the gunmetal one of them is
over there but rock solid sent a copper
pot which is not what we ordered but i
ordered uh
five and i only think it's going to take
four to fill this garage
hopefully um we'll end up finding out
because if not
that's kind of makes it pointless
so
[Music]
[Music]
okay so that's the process we're gonna
keep it up i'm gonna cut the camera and
we'll show you guys once it's all
painted okay that's what the garage
looks like after you uh
paint and swirl uh now we get to wait
eight hours for seven hours and 57
minutes
all right guys so we're on day four of
the floor it is now had way more than 24
hours to dry
and we have a couple issues that i was a
little worried about
let me show you so when we initially put
the floor down i was a little worried
because i could see
where we had patched the cracks in the
floor well as you guys can see
they are still easily seen so we put
as much of the stuff down as we were
supposed to you know like rust-oleum
recommends
a super light coat and it did not cover
that so what i'm going to be doing today
is adding another coat on top of the
floor
only where these little veins are where
we patched up the cracks
and i've also got more rust-oleum
gunmetal stuff
to go on the side wall because you can
see like the concrete kind of goes up
the side
i tried to paint that with whatever i
had left after that third bucket on the
third day
so today i'm just gonna get all of the
side stuff
done uh what it's looking like is it
took three coats to get the floor done
but
maybe we should have used thicker coats
and used a thicker coating
and maybe ended up using like four
buckets or something like that
i'm not sure what we should have done to
make sure we couldn't have seen the
little veins but
it is where it is hopefully adding a
layer on top of it will fix it
so for the side walls uh i tried using a
paintbrush
because i had a little bit left over in
that third bucket but i've got this like
rough roller and i'm going to try to use
a rough roller to paint the concrete on
the wall
it's a lot rougher concrete so the paint
brush just doesn't really do a good job
so hopefully this will work for that
hopefully having two containers will do
all the work i need to do otherwise
we're gonna have an unfinished job
okay so we're gonna get to it and
hopefully uh after today the
this whole garage floor we finished and
looking
stop yeah oh also if you guys notice
that the floor looks a little different
than everybody else's floor that you
watch reviews of it's because i use that
anti-skid additive and all it does is
put little
flakes not flakes but like granules in
the ground
but it makes it so you can't slide so
that way if like oil gets on the ground
when i'm working on a motorcycle or
something like that
shouldn't be sliding all over the place
hopefully so i don't know how that's
going to end up being long term but i'll
let you guys know
way down the road
[Music]
all right guys so as you can probably
notice i've got all of the concrete
that's up on the walls painted and after
doing that i can
highly highly highly highly recommend
getting one of those small rollers i'll
put a link in the description if i can
find one but
having a small roller that's made for
rough surfaces
gets that stuff on so much faster than
the paintbrush
that i was trying to do the other day so
super good idea
with that now that the concrete on the
walls
is finished i'm gonna move on to i'm
gonna make a new batch
of the gunmetal stuff i guess i'm just
gonna pour it over where the vein things
are and
try to do the swirl i really don't know
how this is gonna work out but you know
we'll find out it's the only idea i
really have for like
how to cover these up so we'll see how
that goes
[Music]
[Applause]
oh all right guys so i have now got the
echo so terrible
so i've gone through the floor and added
extra paint
on top of that area something i noticed
while i was doing it
is i believe our main issue when we were
putting the floor down
is when we were rolling everything on
when i was rolling it here
make sure you roll this stuff on lightly
don't press
hard because the areas where i didn't
press hard and we just
lightly rolled the material it stays
thicker because obviously when you press
it
thins out so i
should have what we should have done
from the get go is used
more material rolled it on lighter
sorry for the audio all right so the
apache helicopter is now gone so
uh when you put this floor on just go
light about it don't press hard because
i've noticed where i pressed hard you
can almost see the concrete so
the lighter you go the thicker it will
be and the better it'll look
and the get go so all i have now to do
is wait for 24 hours so we'll check back
in with the floor and what it looks like
then
but so far i think it's going to be a
lot better
all right guys day five of this project
and i'm gonna
call it as good as it's going to get so
in this process i have learned a ton of
stuff
about garage floors and how to use this
epoxy rock solid stuff i've learned so
much in that i'm gonna make an entire
other video of like things to not do
when putting this garage floor on uh
the added material i put over those
cracked
sections worked out really well as you
guys might be able to see you can't even
really see them anymore
and uh the material on the sidewall
ended up being pretty cool as well
uh so i'm gonna have to call the garage
floor
done as it is i have a lot of [ __ ] that
we gotta move into this garage so we can
get back to making my regular motorcycle
videos
so unfortunately i don't have time to
make the garage floor perfect
but i do have a lot of knowledge i'm
going to give you guys in a later video
about
just ways that you can do this and the
like the end product be really nice
because this material has the ability to
look really nice
and we'll just say that my garage floor
is perfectly imperfect that's what i'll
call it
uh it's a good product just all the
stuff online
is just like not good information so
i'm gonna do you guys a favor make it
later dawn video but that's gonna be the
end you can see
videos and things of the floor here and
yeah that's it i'm chased onto wheels i
will see you guys in the next video
i don't know if i can link this material
in the description but if i can
i will you are not
now turning off okay now we get good
audio
awesome i'm gonna go jump off a cliff
later the second
the second i stopped talking wrapped it
up
two times perfectly
[Music]
okay
[Music]
you
