hi welcome to Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana I'm
Roopa yo we are here with party starters
and let's do something interesting with
lamb chops it's called as a sticky lamb
chop let's go ahead and look at the
ingredients we have some lamb chops
tomato ketchup finely chopped onion
minced garlic lemon juice soy sauce
brown sugar fennel powder
Stoney's fennel seeds chili powder salt
olive oil okay to begin with we have to
marinate the chops for about a hour so
let's start with that
take a bowl take the lamb chops they're
nicely cleaned add lemon juice the
fennel seeds salt and olive oil rub it
well in the chops the fennel is the main
ingredient it gets a lot of flavor to
the chops fennan and meat always goes
very well leave it in the refrigerator
for about a hour till the lambs are
getting marinated we'll proceed with the
sauce so take the wok and olive oil
once the oil goes hot add the minced
garlic sathi
add the onions
sahteen let the onions go Brown it'll
take about a minute you can do this on
high flame the onion is gone Brown add
the tomato ketchup add the chili powder
the stone is the fennel seed powder
similar gas mix the laws of flavours get
incorporated add the soya and mix well
as it's cooking add the sugar
give it a mix the sauce that we have
made already has the ketchup and soy
sauce in it so before you add the salt
just check for the seasoning yeah
the salt is not needed and we have
already added salt to the chops so let
the sauce cook add very little water and
simmer for about two minutes the sauce
is cooking on simmer for two minutes
it's got a nice glaze let's add the
marinated chops to it let it go to well
on the chops the sauce and cover and
cook on simmer for about 10 minutes see
almost half done the chops are cooking
as I said for 10-15 minutes
they are half done so let's shut the gas
in the grill pan just brush the oil put
the lamb chops on the grill pan do this
on high flame lower the flame after five
minutes and on either side just see that
it gets a nice mark and a little sticky
texture turn then they've got a lovely
barbecue marks iam soaked let it cook on
the side for another three minutes and
take it out forming the chops
we have brushed it with the sauce and
turn them over and on either sides they
are done it's nicely got caramelized as
you can see and it's got a lovely sticky
texture so let's take it out for sowing
the sticky lamb chops are ready a lovely
party starter it's got a lovely fennel
aroma or the flavor and it goes very
well with the sauce of your choice
