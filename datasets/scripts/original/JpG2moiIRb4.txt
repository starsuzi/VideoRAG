it is supposed to go up to 115 today my
temperature gauge is outside on the
window ledge you want to look
outside today our directions here say
heat oven to 350 degrees it's a peanut
butter
it's got butter in and it's good
now it's time to put the cookies in the
oven
the cookies have been in the oven for
over an hour and I'm going to take a
chance that they're edible at this point
the car high temperature was 200 degrees
it tastes like it's been cooked for
about half time
to pull the cookies out yeah
I think they cooked awesome
no nothing's burnt but look at that
is a cookie
that is a well-cooked cookie
hmm
it's crunchy
and the bottom is still kind of gooey
that is so
amazing
thank you
