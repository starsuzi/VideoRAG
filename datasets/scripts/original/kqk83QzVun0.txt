and for now let's see how cappuccino is made
you can also follow me now on
instagram on twitter at cooking_creative
so now let's talk what's a cappuccino
it's a beverage with expresso steamed
milk and topped with milk foam and
sometimes even chocolate
first to make
an espresso hot water is forced through
freshly ground coffee beans
next milk is poured in steel pitcher now
the milk is steamed and froth until it
becomes double in volume
at temperatures
of 65 to 70 degree Celsius the milk
turns into a microfoam
the base of pitcher is tapped firmly on the counter top to compress the form
now the milk is
poured directly into the cup first
aiming at the center and then continuing
in a circular motion out towards the rim
