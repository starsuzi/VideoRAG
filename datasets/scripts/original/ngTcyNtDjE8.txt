- I'm Coyote Peterson.
And I'm about to be bitten by
the giant desert centipede.
(anxious intense music)
Here we go.
(painful screaming)
(panting and sobbing)
Just, cut the, cut the
cameras, cut the cameras,
we gotta get this
venom extracted,
we gotta get this out of my arm!
(yells)
(intense drumming music)
- I'm rolling cameras.
I'm rolling, I'm rolling.
Um, Mario, here.
Can you turn on the
satellite phone just in case?
I'm gonna get this
venom extractor out.
(Coyote sobbing and grunting)
- Oh, my gosh, guys, okay.
(yells)
- [Camera Man] Tourniquet
or no tourniquet?
- Ah yeah, use the, gimme, I
just want to like so you can...
I think I'm gonna vomit.
Okay. (groans)
- [Cameraman] Let's
put the camera down.
- Oh my gosh, this
is really bad.
- [Camera Man] Alright,
Mario, you're gonna have to
keep rolling on this, We've
got the GoPro going too.
Okay.
- That is spreading, right?
- It is spreading,
it is spreading.
Now we have never
used a venom extractor
before in an episode,
guys, and ah...
It is so painful
right now, and given
the isolation of
where I was bitten,
and when I was bitten by
a Gila monster in my film,
we couldn't use a
venom extractor.
I'm gonna try and see
if we can't suck some
of that venom out of
my, out of my forearm.
Ah, the pain is so bad I
actually was almost in tears.
- I'm gonna try that.
- Cut camera for, (yells).
- [Camera Man] I'm gonna try
and just get some of this off,
so I don't wanna put
venom back in there.
- Yep yep yep, you
can actually see
the venom seeping out
of the edge of my arm,
now look at the
welt, it is swelling.
And now if a centipede
attacks a prey,
- Yeah, I can feel--
- Item--
- It's swelling bad.
(groaning)
Okay, so there's two,
there's two sites.
There's site one, site two,
do you know which was first?
- [Coyote] No, no, the one
up front was the first one,
and then it tucked its
head back and it bit again,
and actually you can see the
black and blue mark there.
I actually think that second
spot injected more venom,
so what you wanna do is
yeah, cuff down on that.
- [Camera Man] I think I,
I think I can get them all.
- You may be able to get it all.
Mario, you got a
tight shot on that?
(yelling)
(yelling more painfully)
Aaah, my gosh, that's
only making it hurt worse!
(muffled scream)
- [Camera Man] Let
it do the work.
- [Coyote] Oh my gosh, that's
crazy, you can actually see
the venom coming up through
the holes where the fangs went
Let's see if you
can zoom in on that.
(grunting)
- [Camera Man] You gotta
tell us if you feel like
you gotta get out of here.
We'll get you out of here.
(heavy breathing)
- Okay.
Like the Gila monster bite,
it comes in waves of pain.
Right now, I'm at a
down trend in the pain.
Now, (screams),
waves of pain, guys.
Okay, let's take this off.
- [Camera Man] Yeah
you're going, no, you
have to unlock it.
- Okay, unlock it.
(exclaims painfully)
- [Camera Man] I gotta, I gotta
put my camera down, hang on.
Here we go, ready?
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- [Camera Man]
Okay, let me know if
you're gonna take it down.
- (yells) Okay, zoom in on that.
- [Camera Man] You can
definitely see the venom.
- Oh my gosh, you can see
the destruction in
the arm right there,
see how black and blue
it's already turning?
It is not, aah, it is not
as bad as the Gila monster.
In the sense that
the Gila monster
sliced through my
thumb and opened me up.
But this, absolutely eclipses
any insect sting
I have ever taken.
It makes the bullet ant
feel like a bee sting.
It makes thirty bee
stings to the face
feel like putting on
facial moisturizer.
This is the most intense
pain I have been in
since the Gila monster, and in
this moment, I am regretting
being bitten by the giant
desert centipede, guys.
I do have this tourniquet on me
just lightly placed,
you don't ever wanna
place a tourniquet down too
tightly, 'cause if you do,
all you're doing is forcing
your heart to beat faster
and that venom to pump
through your system quicker.
Now okay, I'm gonna
wipe that back,
we're gonna put the
extractor on a second time.
- [Camera Man] Is it
pins and needles pain?
Or is it--
- Ah, no, it is searing pain.
It is, someone has
taken a hot poker
and shoved it into my forearm.
My arm is in a state
of paralysis right now,
I cannot move my hand at all.
My arm is swollen
taut. (painful panting)
Let's do a second
extraction here.
- Ready?
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
This actually hurts really
bad just to do this, ready?
- One, two, three.
(screaming)
- [Coyote] The venom
extractor just puts so much
isolated pain
right in that area.
(yells)
(panting)
- [Camera Man] Is it subsiding?
(pants)
- Now the venom from the
giant desert centipede
has a cocktail of potency.
And that cocktail's
called cytolysis.
And right now, what's happening
is that venom is attacking
my red blood cells
and it is breaking them apart,
and that is the pain that
I am feeling right now.
And trust me when I say,
it is unbelievably intense.
(groans)
Let's take off the
venom extractor.
Alright, to do that
I gotta turn this
and just unlock it, right?
Okay, ready?
(Camera Man muttering)
(groans)
- [Camera Man] Oh yeah,
you can definitely see
there's some residual
venom coming out.
- [Coyote] Okay, let me get a
shot of that with the GoPro.
Man.
- [Camera Man] There is
a lot of venom, actually.
- Man, that is painful.
(panting)
It is easily as
bad as I imagined.
Oh my gosh.
- [Camera Man] It is, I take
the tourniquet off your arm.
- Yeah, it's alright, go ahead,
take that off, take that off.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- [Camera Man] One-two-three.
- There's you guys.
- Oh, man.
First time we ever had to
use the venom extractor.
- The venom seems to have
stopped at about the area
where we had the
tourniquet, which is good.
I do believe that the
venom extractor helped.
And right now, all
I wanna do is simply
get out of the hot desert sun
and into an air
conditioned environment.
All I can say is this guys,
if you ever come across
one of these
myriapods in the wild,
simply admire it from
a very safe distance.
Do not try to catch it,
do not try to handle it,
because take my word for it,
this pain is absolutely
unbelievably intense.
You do not want to be
bitten by this animal.
I'm Coyote Peterson, be brave,
stay wild, we'll see you
on the next adventure.
If you ever have an encounter
with a giant desert centipede
in the wild, it's
important to remember
that these animals do
their best to avoid humans.
And interactions, let alone
bites, are incredibly rare.
As the hours pass by, my
arm continued to throb.
And the worst part of
it all, was that with
every wave that rushed
through my body,
the pain was only intensified.
Several hours into the ordeal,
I threw up the white flag
and requested medical
treatment for the bite.
This was the first time
that my mind and body
were unable to endure the
pain of a bite or a sting.
It was truly that bad.
Alright, guys, well
it has been 30 hours
since I was bitten by the
giant desert centipede.
(screams)
Now that you've seen
me go through this,
hopefully you will truly
take away a message that is,
you simply admire these
things from a safe distance.
I do not want to see
pictures out there
on Instagram or
Facebook or Snapchat
of anybody handling
one of these myriapods.
Guys, I'm tough, right?
We know that, I've got a high
pain tolerance, but this?
Put me over the edge.
It is more pain that
I have ever been in.
You can see it in my face,
I am exhausted right now.
I have not slept in 36 hours,
and it's a pain that
I couldn't stop.
That was the scariest
part, is when
the pain was taking over my arm,
all the way up into my shoulder,
I couldn't stop it and it
was only becoming worse.
In all of my time
filming episodes
for the Brave
Wilderness channel,
I have not once gone to see a
doctor after a bite or sting.
The giant desert centipede
put me in Urgent Care.
That's how serious it is.
In the end, was facing my fear
of being bitten by
this nightmare of a
creature worth it?
(screaming)
Well.
At first as I rolled
around on the ground
in agonizing pain, I
would've told you no.
(screaming)
However,
now that the pain is long
gone and all that remains
are the haunting
memories, I would actually
have to say that
yes, it was worth it.
Because together we learned
about the giant
desert centipede.
And most importantly, how
bad the bite really is.
If you are ever
unfortunate enough
to be bitten by one
of these animals,
seek medical
treatment immediately.
As for me, I'm sure
that some of you
still think I am
absolutely crazy.
But at least I can
now proudly say
that what was once
my fear of centipedes
has now evolved into
a newfound fascination
and respect for one of the
planet's creepiest creatures.
If you thought
extracting venom from
my arm looked painful, make sure
to go back and watch
where the chaos began
as I was bitten by the
giant desert centipede.
(screaming in agony)
