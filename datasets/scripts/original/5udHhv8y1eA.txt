Hi there
this video is about how to make egg cucumber sandwich
so let's get started
first in a pan, put in 4 eggs and cover completely with cold water.
Now set the stove in medium high heat and boil for 6 to 7 minutes
I like to use my egg timer though
also add a tablespoon of vinegar to
prevent the eggs from cracking
Now while the eggs are boiling, cut the cucumber in sticks.
Make it a rather thick cut because you want some crunchy texture in the filling.
then sprinkle some salt
 
rub it in, and set aside for about 10 to 15 minutes
you'll only need a teaspoon for one cucumber
next, butter the bread
I prefer the ones that has seeds in it so here we go
but really you can use any kind of bread
you want.
now when the hard-boiled eggs are ready, rinse them in cold water
crack the eggs, roll it, and put it back in the water
crack it, roll it, put it back
this will help peeling the eggs more easily
then under cold running water, peel the eggs
the more the eggs are shocked in cold water
the easier it peels off
there, you can see the eggshell almost slipping out from the egg
easy!
Now we want to separate the eggs in egg yolks and egg whites
in the egg yolk bowl, you put half teaspoon of dijon mustard,
about a tablespoon and half of mayonnaise
then season it with salt and
pepper and mix it all up
now I'm using a fork this time
but you can also use a blender, mortar, whatever suits you
mix it until you get a nice smooth paste
okay so it's a little bit stiff
but we're going to add on mayo later, so it's okay
Now prepare the egg whites
cut them in small pieces
chunky, small, it's up to you
now the cucumber is ready
so put it in a cloth, and squeeze it tightly
it gives an extra
crunchy texture by extracking the water from the cucumber
so I hope you don't
skip this step
then, add the egg yolk paste, and mix it well
now if it well looks a bit stiff like
this
you can simply add more mayonnaise to make the paste smooth and moist
I added an
extra one and a half tablespoon here
at this point, you can refrigerate the egg filling and use it the next day
paste the egg filling on the buttered bread
sand it and press it down
it's also a great lunch box menu
so you can just wrap it up in a parchment paper
throw it in your lunch box and you're good to go
so this is it!
it's a light sandwich but still packed with great nutrition
like protein and vitamins
so I think it's a great for
lunch for people who are on the go
I hope you enjoyed my ever first
