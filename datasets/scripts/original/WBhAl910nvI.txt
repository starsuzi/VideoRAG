take a piece of paper that's 50 cm by 8
cm and then from one end mark a line at
32
CM now in this square that we've got
left we need to divide it into three
sections the first one is 6 cm
the next one 5 and 1
half and this final one should be around
6 and
A2 at this point is probably a good idea
to fold the paper in half length ways
cuz we only need to draw half the
pattern and we want it to be
symmetrical so from this half line you
need to Mark 5 and 1/2 CM
evenly which is going to be around 2.75
there so make a mark there and
there and at this line we need to Mark 3
and
1/2 which is about about
1.75 on the middle
line so from here we're going to draw a
curve around there that goes through
there and then up to that
corner at this point you can leave it a
little straight along that edge just
there doesn't need to
be
exactly and then from here right to the
end a straight line so again Mark
1.75 from the middle
there just join those two lines up extra
extra
one that's basically it now what you can
do
Let's Fold it in half and just cut out
the
one side and you're going to get your
symmetrical B tie
pattern that's the button
so using the pattern you've made cut out
four bow tie shapes and also four pieces
of interfacing the interfacing only
needs to reach to the end of the bow we
don't need to do the
strap the side which is going to be the
wrong side of the fabric the one that's
going to be inside the bow tie and iron
interfacing onto each
side always make sure you get the glue
glue side down otherwise you make a mess
of your
iron now pin these together
together right now we're going to sew
from here a tin tiny little bit around
the corner all the way around and back
and make the top corn matching so
basically we're leaving a hole between
those bits so that we can pull
everything back through you're going to
sew half a CM from The
Edge so now it shows better where we've
stitched we need to clip the corners
both that side and that
side and clip the curves up to the line
of
stitching which helps it to lay flat
when we turn it inside
out now here comes the fun part we need
to open the hole and pull everything
through
the right way
out using your pencil
gently pke out the corners
let's make them
sharp took that little Edge back inside
itself so it looks nice and neat
I'll repeat that with the other
one that's both ready we need to now
iron them
now we've got to stitch this hole
closed invisibly so this is how we do it
we open it up and we start our
thread from from inside
there and always keeping it just inside
the top
line and then go just under just again
under
there take a
stitch which is now coming on that side
cross over just again Under The
Edge another Stitch just a running
Stitch
but all the time keeping it just inside
tie off the knot
and I like to pull my thread
inside so that I don't have an end
sticking
out just pull it a little bit tight cut
off and then the Loose Ends saved inside
the
tie nice neat invisible stitched
Edge now for the next
one you're almost there now then all we
need to do is overlap these two straps
and attach them need to overlap them by
about 5
cm you can attach
velcro I like to put some button holes
and two shirt buttons because I think it
looks smart so I take one side and I'm
just going to use the machine to do two
machine stitched button
holes like this and match that up with
two shirt buttons on the other side
and that just means once he TIY tie nice
and tidy if it doesn't want to undo the
knot it can just undo it from the back
instead and that's it tie is ready
