all right for the bottom this is just a
piece of old maybe 316 P something like
that I think it's old it came off old
shelf or something that I found
and I just it got the raining on out
there and I had to squeeze up in this
shed real
quick so I just grabbed that and cut it
down before I came in
here some of these pallet boards will
fit up a little funny I didn't do a
whole lot to smooth them I didn't do any
kind of plain in or anything like that I
just smooth them
enough the insid and stuff anyway to you
know to get a decent fit up it's just a
bird house
so but still needs to stay
together
to
you
feel
all right I finished this bird house up
and it came out looking pretty good all
pallet
wood there a couple different kinds of
wood you can hear these chickens back
here holler everything came out looking
pretty
good it's got these plants these I think
they're vas or something these plants
can be changed if you want to change
them whoever gets it and on the top I
put a ey hook on each side and it'll
just hang up like that off this little
hook
also and I I don't think I showed that
on the video but I put this little perch
in there uh I put a coat of polyurethane
on it just to kind of add a little
weather protection to it that pallet
wood I mean it last in the weather quite
a while
anyway and
uh but a little polyure thing just to
help it out and you seen I put that oil
on I just put the oil to try to bring
out the colors a little
more everything came out looking pretty
good but uh
so I guess that'll wrap that one
up also I went ahead and done this one
too and this one I I'm trying to do a
aged kind of look to it I painted it
white and then painted some brown over
it and then sanded a lot of that off of
there and then put some of this
uh decorative glaze on there it's
supposed to make it look aged it works
sometimes depending on the color you got
and a PL to go on the side of there and
I I'm just letting it dry up right now
but it came out pretty good that's just
plywood some more cheap plywood that's
off it came off of a pallet but I just I
didn't want to leave it as just
plywood so anyway I guess that'll do
it if uh if you like these type of
videos man I don't usually I mean I'm
not building a lot of bird houses around
here I'm doing them now because of um
I'm still doing the farmers market in
Boer and I'm just trying to get some
more stuff for it and I'm thinking
something like that will probably sell
pretty good but uh and I'm still waiting
to get steel on that Barbecue Pit I know
yall waiting on part two for that and
I'm going to get it done it's just this
is kind of what I'm doing little Oddball
stuff until I get the steel for it but
