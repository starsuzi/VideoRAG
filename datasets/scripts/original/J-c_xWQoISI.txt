hello this is Carrie Ferris with the
battle of the yeasties and today we are
going to learn how to make our own
liquid Stevia um I use powdered whole
Stevia leaves um you can grow your own
stevia plant dry out the leaves and
powder it yourself but I just don't have
time for that right now um you will also
need a funnel and a regular coffee
filter a small glass boiling
water and it's good to have an Amber
dropper bottle I I'm actually using an
old bottle from a commercially made
Stevia that I had bought before I knew
better so what you do is you put
your your funnel into your glass and put
your coffee filter down in there and you
put about one
teaspoon of the powdered Stevia Leaf
into the coffee filter
and you're going to pour your boiling
water over that until you
have about 4
oz of liquid Stevia down
here you do not
want the stevia to sit in steep you want
it to run straight through your filter
as quickly as possible because the
longer the water sits
on the stevia itself the more bitter it
becomes so if you just want a sweet
liquid then you want it to run through
as quickly as possible okay I've got
about my
four ounces there so I'm just going to
take this and throw it
away and then I'm going to
take my liquid
Stevia and put it in my dropper
bottle I actually have two dropper
bottles each one holds about 2
oz
um
so that's why I make four at a time and
one teaspoon does a really good job of
doing
um doing four liquid ounces and you want
this to cool a little bit before you put
your dropper back in there but it's
really that simple and that easy if you
taste this straight from the glass it's
going to taste like a very very sweet
tea you can use this in baking you can
use it directly into tea or other
liquids that you're sweetening and I
hope you learn something and have a
great day
