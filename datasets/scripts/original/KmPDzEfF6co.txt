so now they'll go ahead and put the
so fairly straightforward fairly easily
done takes a little bit
of patience to kind of get it done so
that you do a nice clean
job it's not overly complex but you just
have to take the time and
care and so Hae
is attaching the the bottom corner
corner and we going to leave the face on
this so we're going to leave it so that
we leave this protective coating on top
H I don't I don't know I don't think so
you want to take it off yeah
yeah it's always fun removing this
stuff we just peeling away that material
so this will be hung we already have
produced two pieces for this guy's a
producer so he's happy about the ones
that we've already done so now we've got
this last well I don't know if this is
the last piece but certainly an
additional project for
him so real simple real
easy and so
[Music]
just about
done this one turned out fairly
well a whole lot easier to do it this
way than what we had done before which
was put adhes of vinyl on the whole
whole piece
there it is okay good job so let's go
ahead and tilt that up and let me take a
look at
[Music]
it so that's how that's going to look
and then what we're going to do is we
just going to have a cleat on the
back that's going to
actually support the
piece and that's
it real straightforward real simple and
so this actually has the polished
Edge and so that's how that looks
