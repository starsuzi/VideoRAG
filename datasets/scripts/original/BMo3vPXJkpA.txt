Ok, and now we're moving on to the next stain,
which is ketchup and mustard, very common,
for people that like to eat in the living
room, so ketchup and mustard are removed from
the same method. It means they have a lot
of water content to them , so it's actually
not that difficult, as long as you catch it
as soon as it happens. First thing you want
to do, is remove as much of the excess as
you possibly can, so that you're not spreading
it around,
and then just finish blotting it with a paper
towel. Then, you want to use some cold water,
with about a third teaspoon of soap, and then
you want to sponge that into the area, pretty
thoroughly. Now, most of the time, this will
be able to remove the stain completely, but
if it doesn't, you can also use a laundry
stain remover, that you would to get these
same products out of your clothing, so now
that the stain is gone, you would want to
let it air dry, and if you come back, and
the stain is still a little bit there, it's
because of the water behind it, that would
leave a ring around it, and you just want
to repeat the process, with that ring staying
in the area of the stain, so it doesn't spread.
Let it air dry again, and the stain should
be completely gone.
