hey guys today I'm going to be showing
you how to make a hamster um a hamster
treat yeah a hamster treat
ball um and you will just need a ball
like this one and it doesn't need to be
scented or anything and I'm sorry if you
can hear that cat in the background
that's my cat and he's trying to get my
room so you will need um a ball like
this one and I got mine at Dollar
General I think well it came with like
lights it was like a light set and I was
going to use them for my hamster cage
but then my cat no my little sister did
something to them and she broke them so
I just used the balls now um you will
need
some hamster
treats
and I already have mine out of the
package um you're going to need some
hamster hay Timothy Hay
sorry um and you're going to need some
of your hamsters favorite
foods so let's get
started what you want to do first is you
want
to
um get your head
and take it and just fold it in half
like every little piece that you fit in
there um and find like a pretty good
size hole like this
one and just stick it
in and you don't have to do a lot of hay
or
anything but I like to do a pretty good
amount of ha
um cuz to hide the
treats and my Syrian hamster she tore
her ball up so like there wasn't even a
ball left there were just these like
half wooden
circles um lying around our cage and so
I had to pick those
up
but um it was worth it cuz she loved it
so much
much
and you can do more than one at a time
which is what I'm doing to save
time and you can like cut up some
whimsies shoes and you can probably
stick them in here or some green
which I Greenies are easy to cut
so um I'm not going to do that today
though so I think that's enough hay and
it's kind of sticking
out
um the sides so and you just want to get
your hamster treats and I think these
are too big so I'm just going to break
it um so it can fit through the ho
um and then you can get um like all of
your treats and stuff and you can just
start stick them sticking them in
there
um yeah
it's not it's really not hard and
sometimes they fell out they fall out
like this one just
did um you just got to just keep shoving
them in
there
