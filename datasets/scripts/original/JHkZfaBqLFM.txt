Breakfast is the most important meal of the
day — but only if you do it right.
Right?
"Like most women in commercials, I love to
start each day doing yoga in my underwear.”
“Or journaling, in my journaling nook.”
"And eating a wholesome, farm-fresh breakfast."
You can power up your morning with a superfood,
or instantly feel like you're running on empty.
It's all up to you!
Here are some food tips that every healthy
person knows will make them win their day.
No excuses
The first rule of the breakfast club is that
you have to actually eat breakfast.
Whether you're trying to lose weight or you're
just not that hungry in the morning, it can
be tempting to skip those calories and hold
out 'til lunch.
Sound familiar?
If that describes your morning routine, science
would like a word with you.
Skipping breakfast can increase your risk
of diabetes and heart disease, on top of actually
making it harder for you to lose weight.
"My head's about to explode.
My whole life sucks.”
Fruit freak
Adding fruit to your breakfast not only provides
you with critical vitamins and minerals that
help your body fuel up when the sun's up.
"Good morning,good morning / we've talked
the whole night through.”
The extra dietary fiber can also help you
feel fuller for longer.
This simple addition to your breakfast packs
a one-two punch of nutrition, while helping
you maintain your weight since you won't get
the munchies and eat all the things for lunch.
Hey, even adding a few raspberries amps up
your antioxidants, and immune-boosting nutrients
like Vitamin C. But did you know they also
help prevent eye disease and arthritis thanks
to their anti-inflammatory properties?
Mm-hmm!
They're berry important!
Go green
A smoothie is a fantastic way to start your
day, but the color is oh-so-important.
Why go green?
Because we're talking about veggie-based smoothies.
With fruit-based smoothies, it's easy to accidentally
load your nutrient-rich breakfast with tons
of sugar and calories.
Vegetable smoothies, on the other hand, offer
a bounty of health benefits like increased
energy and crucial antioxidants — without
all that extra sugar.
That's the smooth, sweet taste of victory.
"It looks very healthy."
“It’s very filling because of the fiber.”
"Oh that is really good.
I thought it was gonna taste like grass.”
Roll your oats
Oatmeal is the breakfast triple threat: high-fiber,
low-calorie, and loaded with critical minerals
your body needs.
On top of helping control hunger through high
fiber content, oatmeal is naturally gluten-free!
Just make sure you, like, know what that means.
"You have no idea what gluten is."
“I do know what gluten is, gluten’s a
vague term.
It’s something that’s used to categorize
things that are bad.
You know?
Calories, that’s a gluten.
Fat, that’s a gluten.”
Greek geek
There are so many health benefits to eating
Greek yogurt — it's simply jam-packed with
nutrients.
It's also got plenty of protein, which helps
keep your stomach from growling even longer
after a meal.
The calcium contained in Greek yogurt has
been shown to help with weight loss, too.
On top of all that, this superfood is loaded
with probiotics to give your immune system
a natural boost.
"The angle's all wrong."
“Aren’t you supposed to just tip the little
plastic cup part up and dump the jam into
the yogurt?”
"How would you know that?
Have you been eating my Fage yogurts?"
Cuppa joe
It turns out a cup of coffee or two a day
is fantastic for your health.
Studies have shown that it can decrease the
risk of Alzheimer's, as well as improve your
cardiovascular health.
Heart disease is the number one cause of death
in the world, so anything that keeps your
heart happy is a great way to start the day.
“You did it!
Congratulations.
World's best cup of coffee.
Great job, everybody!”
Tea time
Not a coffee person?
No problem!
The many health benefits of tea include: protecting
your heart, improved weight loss, and cancer-fighting
antioxidants.
Tea can also help your immune system, as well
as help strengthen your teeth and bones.
Going nuts
Time Magazine asked five health experts if
we should all be eating almond butter, and
every single one said yes.
Its main draw is that it packs a ton of health
benefits into one little dollop, including
fiber, protein, and healthy fats.
Almond butter even contributes to lowering
your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and
stroke.
And the cherry on top?
It's as easy as adding a spoonful to your
green smoothie or oatmeal!
The best kind of germ
Wheat germ is nutrient-dense, and filled with
energy-boosting B vitamins and fiber.
It can also help lower cholesterol thanks
to its omega-3 fatty acids and phytosterols.
Wheat germ provides your body with vitamin
E, a powerful antioxidant, and minerals like
zinc, calcium, and manganese.
As if that wasn't enough, it even contains
compounds that can help those who suffer from
certain cancers, as well as rheumatoid arthritis.
Add these foods into your morning mix, and
you'll be slaying your day in no time!
"Come and get your breakfast / now eat it
/ eat it."
"Now chew it up / cha-cha-chew it up."
