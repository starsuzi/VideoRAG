hi Phyllis here from southernfrugal.com
we're getting ready to make salmon
patties um these salmon patties are made
just like you would make crab cakes and
you have to use the pink salmon because
it's not
as fishy as the red salmon but here are
the
ingredients we'll
need 13 a cup of um
red bell pepper let me turn the camera
so you can
see the juice from one
lemon about A3 of a cup of shredded
onion some uh bread
crumbs Old Bay
Seasoning dill
weed 13 thir a cup of self-rising
flour one egg and of course a 14 and 34
o can of pink salmon all right now let's
get started first thing I'm going to do
is dump my salmon in a bowl after I've
drained
it just drain it as thorough as you can
can and the next thing I'm going to
do is pick off the
skin see the skin there going to take
all that off and my dogs will get this
treat later okay so I'm not just wasting
it but you want to uh have a real mild
tasting Seafood
so any that's dark on there or the skin
you want to
remove so that you've just got the pink
meat from the
salmon now I don't particularly like
salmon
patties in fact I don't like them at all
but I love this um now my sister told me
about this
recipe and of course I've altered it a
lot uh because I didn't like the recipe
she gave me however I did like it better
than just regular salmon patties so so
try to get all that uh dark skin off cuz
that's where that fishy real fishy taste
is going to come from sometimes I just
use a spoon to Rack it
off and again I'm not going to throw it
away I'm going to actually mix it in
with the dog's food
tonight cuz they love
fish but they don't get it very often
just once in a while
W so see how I'm raking all the dark off
all of
it and all the
skin and of course any bones you'll want
to take out
also see there's some skin I'm just
going to scrape it off with my
fingers okay there we have it
then you want to just crumble that
up in your
bowl any little bones you want to pick
those out
also just crumble it all up with your
fingers okay now we're going to add the
1/3 cup of shredded onion now shread
those so I don't run across cross any
big hunks of onion just shred them on
your
Shredder third of a cup of red bell
pepper 13 cup of self-rising
flour and one whole extra large
egg now I'm just going to mix that up a
little
bit all right next I'm going to put in
the dill weed and I'm just going to
shake some
in Dill uh weed goes very very well with
any kind of seafood there it is dill
weed next I'm going to use a tablespoon
of this Old Bay Seasoning that's one
whole tablespoon and I know that seems
like a
lot but it's it's really not that much
get it out of this
side there you go got a tablespoon of
that mix that all
in next I'm going to go ahead and pour
into the juice of two lemons
[Applause]
mix that all up
thoroughly and now just for good measure
I'm going to put in a really big heaping
tablespoon of
breadcrumbs all right now it already
smells like crab cakes and it's going to
taste like crab cakes so so just mix
that all up now I'm going to form it
into patties and then coat the patties
with this uh breadcrumbs bre breadcrumb
mixture there and then I'm going to fry
them so we'll be back when I get these
formed into patties and I'll show you
what they look
like okay the salmon uh patties are U
frying now and by the way I do fry those
in a couple of tablespoons of butter and
a little bit of canola oil so for lunch
we're going to have some of my frozen
collards jasmine rice and we're going to
have some Tomatoes over the rice I just
call these stewed tomatoes I just use a
can of tomatoes with a little bit of
butter all right now we're going to make
the sauce to go on the salmon patties
and it's really really
simple all I do is take a couple of
really Heap tablespoons of
mayonnaise
okay
and cream style horse radish and a
really heaping teaspoon of that a whole
bunch
right and then I'm going to just squirt
some ketchup in there not a whole lot
maybe you know about three squirts one
two
three
and then I'm just going to mix that
up looks almost like thousand Isen
dressing except it's got horseradish in
it and it's not really that hot but that
horseradish will give it a a real
distinct taste okay all right so this is
the sauce that we're going to put over
our salmon patties when they get done
all right that can made eight patties
let me take it over here so you can
see and I'm frying them in a couple of
tablespoons of butter and a little bit
of canola oil now when all this gets
done and we're ready to Plate it up
we'll be
back okay Lunch is ready and we are
having the uh salmon patties with the
little horseradish sauce on them
collared greens that I got at the
Farmers Market and some jasmine rice
with stewed tomatoes and a little piece
of cornbread and of course the
everpresent iced tea I want to show you
a closeup of the salmon patties now they
do taste very very much like crab cakes
and since I don't like salmon patties
this just works great for me so we're
going to go ahead and have our lunch and
we will see you next
time
