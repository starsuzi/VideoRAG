hi it's Glen the ball Chef it's 4:30 in
the morning and today we're making up a
turducken now I've made turduckens in
the past that could be difficult I
actually ordered this one online from a
company down New Orleans and we had to
get it for I'm going to show you exactly
how we're going to put this together so
we're going to watch you follow these
clips to show you exactly how to cook
your Trucking okay the uh uh JRE here is
we're going to be preing this oven here
to
225 uh and we're going to put this bird
breast side up for uncovered now 4 hours
for 4
hours all right this is a
trucking and uh we're getting ready to
pop this guy in the oven it's going to
take
about 8 hours to cook this
bird and uh this is what it looks like
we got it breast side up so we're going
to place this into the
oven and so now we've got the uh
turducken nested into the uh oven we've
set our timer for 4 hours which we're
going to be cooking the uh bird at for
uh initial stages here and uh there she
sits let's Let Her
Go um you got to start off earli here
it's 4 4:25 in the morning I want to be
able to eat this thing uh at a
reasonable hour I want to be eating than
give you dinner at midnight so you got
to get up early if you want to do one of
these our truck's been in the oven now
for 4 hours and what we're going to do
now since we've been cooking it
uncovered is we're going to Simply cover
the turducken up it's starting to get a
nice golden
brown the aroma smells good looking good
uh everybody wants a piece of the turkey
or the D ducking but they're not going
to get it until it's done so let's go
ahead and put that top on pops there you
go put that on there we started this
this turkey or this production at 4:30
and now we're at 8:36 we're we're 4
hours in in in the uh time's clicking
and we're going to be eating soon The
Next Step here is we're going to brush
some extra virgin olive oil onto our
Trucking to keep that skin nice and dry
don't want it to be uh
dried out we want it to be
moist so this the stage of the game we
don't really have any drippings yet so
we're just using
plain extra virgin olive
oil uh since our deduction was
completely seasoned at the factory uh we
don't really need to season it we just
need to keep some oil on it to keep the
skin nice and
moist and then we're going to pop it put
back into that oven all right we pulled
the trucken out of the oven uh it's been
in there for 8 and 1/2 hours the
thermometer is reading at
164 and what we're going to do is we're
going to let this sit out for
about uh all right folks now I've
covered it up with aluminum foil built a
little tint on it and we're just going
to let this rest like I said for about
an hour got the timer set and we'll be
ready to eat some diru before you know
it all right we now have the turducken
and we're going to start uh carving this
turducken up again this is a
