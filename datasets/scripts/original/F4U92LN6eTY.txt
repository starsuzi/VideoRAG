hey everybody thanks for stopping by my
easy cooking channel I was watching a
food review video yesterday uh by a guy
named Ken and he lives in uh uh Canada
kbd Productions and um he did this food
review and it was on a western sandwich
and I'm like what's a western sandwich
so I Googled it and it's actually called
it Denver sandwich as another name for
it and it's basically a Denver
omelette between two pieces of bread so
I said well what's in a Denver omelette
basically it's ham and eggs peppers and
onions so I'm like aha that would be the
perfect toaster oven recipe so let's get
toasting so I dug through the fridge and
here's what I had in there I had this
little ham and some eggs green onion and
and red pepper now I think a Denver
umblance calls for a green pepper but I
really don't care for green pepper and
uh when do I ever follow uh rules anyway
I just cook out of my head so basically
I'm just going to uh put a little bit of
this coconut oil in the bottom of this
cast iron skillet here and then we'll
cut this stuff up and mix it in with a
couple eggs there and put it in the
toaster oven got a little bit of that
red pepper cut up
I'm cutting up a little green onion here
scissors work really good on green
onions I like using scissors better than
a
knife and I don't use the bottom part of
the onion I don't like that part I just
use this the green part I got some ham
all cut up there and put three eggs in
the cast darn Skillet and I'm just going
to put a little bit of kosher salt in
there um look how nice and lean this ham
is look at that perfect it's a honey
cured ham but really lean not much fat
in that this will be good for this and
then I got my peppers and onions
here and
uh heck I'm just going to mix all this
together now I'm just going to use my
hands it's the easiest
[Music]
way now when I'm done here we'll get
this in the toaster oven turned the oven
all the way up to 450Â°
have everything all mixed up here looks
real pretty so we'll just put that on in
there and we'll be back in a few minutes
it's been about 10 or 15 minutes here so
let's check on
this oh yeah look at that that looks
nice I think that's probably done I'm
going to pull it out of there that
almost looks too pretty to cut into I'm
letting it cool down while I make some
toast and then uh we'll make our
sandwich here in a minute all right so
now now we'll see what happens here what
I did is tried to carve out a piece
about the same size as a piece of bread
see if I can get out of the
pan and I put cheese on the bread so
that that'll melt
[Music]
it yeah look at that it worked I
think okay let's put our sandwich
together here that came out of there
pretty good it's kind of pretty looking
too now we'll just put the lid on
there well my Western sandwich looks
pretty good question is does it taste
any good so let's get a quick bite
here man that's good anytime you have
ham and eggs and cheese you can't go
wrong but that red bell PE pepper gives
it kind of a nice
sweetness um yeah really enjoy that so
I'm going to finish eating it thanks for
watching you guys and I'll talk to you
next time
