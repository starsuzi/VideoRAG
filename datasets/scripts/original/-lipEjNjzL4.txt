right from apex detail here today we
want to clean up some mats before we
throw them back in the car and I don't
want to drag out the heavy pressure
washer so we're gonna use the steamer
let's see how it works
some pretty nasty mats here
first a quick back
[Music]
some all-purpose cleaner
and steamer with long bristle brush
you
a quick vac followed up by some
compressed air
[Music]
that looks pretty good
and we're going to clean these as well
[Music]
[Music]
good to go so there is yet another use
for the steamer I'm gonna have more
videos coming out on this stay tuned
thank you bride from apex detail see you
next time
