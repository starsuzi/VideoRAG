okay everyone here i have as a cushion
um we've got wine coffee mustard
and ketchup because i'm figuring these
are the most common stains you can get
on cushion
i've unzipped the zipper to the cushion
and i got a towel underneath where my

pointing color stain remover is very
kind to fabrics
let's see what we get here what i want
you to do is rub it in
best you can with your hands and then
this is all this is water set it to
stream
so what i want you to do
and block
and wow first shot
we got looks like everything out but the
little bit of mustard is left right here
of course it depends on what type of
fabric it is i have no idea
what this is or if it's scotch got it or
anything
else but i want you to blast it a stream
of water that's all i want you to do
winning colors loves water and
this is just wet that's all you're
seeing there

just
uh knocked out in less than probably a
minute the stains were probably on there
for about 10 minutes

four most common stains
