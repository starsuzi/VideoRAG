WELCOME TO COOK'S CORNER.
WE'RE JOINED BY LIZ BARBOUR,
SHE'S ALREADY AT WORK FOLKS.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING TODAY?
TODAY WE'RE WORKING WITH
FIDDLEHEADS.
IT'S AN EARLY SPRING PLANT, IT'S
LIKE ASPARAGUS, WILD LEEKS.
THEY'RE HARVESTED FRESH.
WHAT'S THE FLAVOR LIKE?
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
THEY'RE A LOT LIKE AN ASPARAGUS
ACTUALLY, BUT I FIND--
THE THING IS MANY OF US ARE NOT
FAMILIAR WITH WORKING WITH THEM.
THESE ARE FERNS THAT HAVE NOT
UNFURLED, OK?
SO THEY LOOK LIKE THE TOP OF A
VIOLIN, HOW IT KIND OF CURLS
AROUND LIKE THAT.
FIDDLEHEAD.
THE KEY WITH WORKING WITH
FIDDLEHEADS, FIRST OF ALL, YOU
HAVE TO BLANCH THEM IN BOILING
WATER BECAUSE THERE'S ALMOST
LIKE A BROWN FUZZ THAT IS
WRAPPED UP IN THAT FIDDLEHEAD
AND IF YOU BLANCH THEM AND YOU
CAN SEE THE STUFF THAT'S LEFT
OVER, IT'S NOT DIRT, IT IS THAT
FROND.
SO, YOU BLANCH THEM.
THAT GOES AWAY, OK?
YOU LEAVE THAT BEHIND.
YOU CAN RUN THEM UNDER COLD
WATER SO THEY DON'T GET TOO HOT.
HERE I'VE GOT GARLIC AND THESE
ARE PARTIALLY COOKED NOW AND
NOW, I'M GOING TO SAUTE' THEM
UP, I'M GOING TO LOWER MY HEAT,
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.
I'M GOING TO GET MY GARLIC AND
BUTTER AND YOU CAN DO THIS WITH
OLIVE OIL IF YOU LIKE, SAUTE'
THEM UP.
TAKES ABOUT TWO TO THREE
MINUTES.
AND THEN YOU CAN SERVE THEM
JUST AS YOU WOULD WITH ASPARAGUS
OR OTHER VEGETABLES.
IS ANYTHING KIND OF--
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
THEY WON'T UNFURL.
DON'T WAIT FOR IT.
DON'T WAIT FOR IT.
BUT THEY'LL SOFTEN UP AND FINISH
WITH SALT AND PEPPER PAN YOU CAN
ALSO--
THIS WOULD BE WONDERFUL WITH
LIKE SOY SAUCE OR SESAME OIL OR
STUFF LIKE THAT, TOO.
DO YOU LIKE TO ADD SPECIAL
FLAVORS?
I THINK THE SIMPLER YOU DO
IT, THE BETTER.
THEN YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO
TASTE THE VEGETABLE ITSELF.
IT'S A WONDERFUL SIDE DISH.
A LOT OF PEOPLE NEVER TRIED IT
BEFORE.
BLANCH IT FIRST AND THEN SAUTE'
IT.
SHOULD I BE LOOKING FOR IT
MYSELF IN THE FOR REST OR--
NO, YOU WOULDN'T FIND THEM AT
THIS POINT BECAUSE THEY'RE
UNFURLED.
SO I WOULD GO, I KNOW MARKET
BASKET IS CARRYING THEM.
AND YOU CAN GO TO WHOLE FOODS.
MOST STORES NOW ARE CARRYING
THEM.
THESE ARE THE ONES THAT I'VE
BEEN INTO RECENTLY AND I'VE SEEN
THEM.
SO, YEAH, THEY'RE AVAILABLE AND
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE
ENJOYING FIDDLEHEADS.
AND IF YOU WANT TO LEARN
MORE, YOU DO CLASSES.
I DO COOKING DEMONSTRATIONS
AND CAN DO THIS IN YOUR HOME.
THESE WILL BE DONE SOON AND
