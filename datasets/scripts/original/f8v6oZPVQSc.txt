Today's topic is how to remove a sticker from
a car window like this one on this car here.
The best way to do that is to use a razor
blade and some Windex or some type of glass
cleaner. To remove this sticker I use a razor
blade and some glass cleaner. I spray the
windshield on the sticker. Use the razor blade
to scrape it down. Very carefully. These are
sharp these are industrial razor blades. You
can see how it's coming off. It's coming off
fairly easy. Now that I have it wet I can
actually peel it off. Spray a little more
on and peel the sticker off. If you have problems
use your razor blade. In this case it's coming
off fairly easy. I have the sticker off and
I'm going to take the razor blade and scrape
and scrape and scrape and scrape. This will
get the rest of that off. Then I need a proper,
a rag to wipe it down. Use a paper towel or
a rag to wipe it off. And you can feel it
with your finger there is nothing on there
anymore. There's no glue. Now with a proper
towel, paper towel just wipe it down and you
are done. Make sure you don't leave your razor
blade lying around so some kids don't get
it. These are very sharp, these are industrial
ones. You can get them at any parts store.
This is the proper way to remove a sticker
from inside a vehicle.
