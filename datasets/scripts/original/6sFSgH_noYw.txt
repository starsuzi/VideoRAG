through the ingredients I have and I'm
not going to chop
these vegetables on the screen I'm going
to chop them off the screen I want to
keep this video as quick as possible now
to start off this is what I have h a
kilo of
oxtail I've got here three spring onion
a small
onion one red
pepper a scotch Bonny chili
five Maggie cubes ginger and garlic
paste now I normally use the fresh one
but I don't have any at the moment so
I'm just going to use that for now and
here you've got dry time allp purpose
seasoning ground nutmeg and a tin of
chopped
tomatoes I'm going to go through the
measurements on what to put into the
elil as we go along so yeah let's get
started
now I'm going to boil the meat I'm going
to turn on the heat on
[Music]
low and add 800 mL of
water alongside with that I'm going to
add four Maggie cubes
[Music]
just squeeze it with your
fingers and here you
go now I'm going to add 1 tbsp of garlic
and
ginger and now I'm going to
[Music]
add 1
teaspoon of allpurpose seasoning
[Music]
half a teaspoon of BR
[Music]
nutmeg
and use half a teaspoon of dry
th and I'm going to close the lid and
leave it for 45
[Music]
minutes so it's been 45
minutes now the oxar is soft
enough but is not yet
[Music]
ready on this stage you can also taste
it just to see if
tast it to see if everything tastes the
way you want it if anything you can just
add Maggie cube a another Maggie
Cube but if not that should be
[Music]
fine okay now what I'm going to do is
fry all the
[Music]
vegetables just going to
add bit of
oil I just add a reasonable amount of
oil and what I'm going to
do is just pour everything in
there and
[Music]
and now I'm going to add one in here
remember we starting off with five and
we added four here and then I'm going to
add a teaspoon of all purf for
seasoning give it stir
so with the tint of tomato I'm not going
to put everything in there I'm just
going to put about a quarter to
half so I'm just going to pour half of
it half of the Tomato T in
there and just give it ftir
[Music]
I left it to simmer for about a minute
what I'm going to do is add the
oxil just the oxil not the juice
okay so what I'm going to do I'm going
to use
this just get the
O and mix it with the sauce
[Music]
what I'm going to do is just stir it and
just put my heat to
medium continue to give it
[Music]
stir now I've been stirring it and
mixing everything together for 5 minutes
so what I'm going to do is get
the get the pot that we
used and just put the heat to medium
make sure this medium and we're just
going to pour it in there okay just
going to pour everything in
[Music]
there that's why you have to keep your
juice you don't have to throw it away or
use water we're going to use the stock
the
stock that we use for the oxtail we just
going to use it now I'm just going to
stir everything thing together just
mixing the
stock with all the meat and
vegetables now what I'm going to do next
is add the scotch Buon of chili now this
is completely optional it's just
something that I like to do so I'm just
going to cut into
[Music]
half and just put in
there and here's the lid
turn the heat bit up so it's just
between high and
medium so we're just going to leave it
for 15 minutes and it should be
done so it's been 15
minutes I'm just going to quickly give
it a stir so on this stage what I do
I'll just get rid of one or two because
you can't mess with these bad boys
just give it a
stir and here you
go can you smell it like literally can
