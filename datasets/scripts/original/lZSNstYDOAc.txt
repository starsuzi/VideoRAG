how to clean a kitchen sink so it shines
hello and welcome to videojug a sink
must be one of the most used areas in
any kitchen food scraps and dirty water
soon built up making it look far from
perfect let alone hygienic luckily help
is at hand
Jacqueline Hansen our experimental
cleaners is going to show us how to
clean a sink so it shines step 1 you
will need rubber gloves cream cleaner a
metal scour a household sponge a soft
cloth and paper towels step 2 out with
the old have a good look at your
cleaning cloths if you have any that
look grubby throw them away they will
only spread dirt and germs step 3 remove
scraps brush new food particles from the
draining board into the sink use your
hand or any suitable utensils to gather
the dirt and food pieces from the sink
and throw into the bin do not try and
push the pieces down the plughole as it
will block the pipes step 4
cream cleaner give the sink a quick wipe
under a running tap to rinse off
superficial dirt squirt a cream cleaner
over the sink and draining board a cream
cleaner is best on kitchen sinks as its
thicker consistency coats the grime ear
areas working into grease and dirt make
sure there is a generous amount around
the grub ear places these will be the
sides of the sink and the plug hole
step 5 get scrubbing if you have a metal
sink use a metal scour
use a less abrasive scour if your sink
is ceramic scrub the entire area pay
particular attention to any details such
as around the plug and fixings clean the
taps to don't forget the base as well as
the handles and spout
step 6 rinse start the water running to
rinse the cream cleaner away working it
around the sink with a scarer use a
sponge to rinse the draining board
wiping the cleaner along the draining
board and back into the sink
step 7 dry dry the entire sink area with
a soft cloth this is important as it
removes any final traces of residue left
from the cream cleaner
step 8 the taps
to give a really good shine on the taps
give them a final polish with a paper
towel
Jacqueline advises using paper towels as
they buff without leaving lint have a
final check over the sink lifting any
smudges with the paper towels spotless
done
