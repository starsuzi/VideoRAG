The Italians, they make a big, glorified sponge
like this and they put it in a posh box, and
we love it.
It's a brilliant little present and you can
toast it.
But it's beautiful, absolutely beautiful in
bread and butter pudding.
All I'm gonna do is take the end off, about
one centimeter and then we can take the base
off one centimeter.
And then the sides like this, just one centimeter
slices.
We don't waste anything.
I'm just gonna trim this base here of this
brown crust.
I'm gonna put this onto the bottom, just like
that.
And then all I'm gonna do is use these little
crusts, squeeze them and push them up against
the sides like that.
What I love about this is, instead of having
to worry about perfectly rolling out pastry,
you know, you can really make a great job
of this.
If you do it sort of a little bit scruffy
and not so perfect it's still great.
So that's our base done.
It's gonna flavor that beautiful custard cream
there.
Just a third...goes in.
It will get sucked up straight away.
It absorbs very quickly.
Then we have the rest of this custard.
In actual fact we've got all of the bits that
have fallen off of the wonderful panattone,
plus this bit here, and actually if I rip
this open you can kinda see, see that texture.
And whether it's stale or fresh it really
doesn't matter.
So I'm must gonna break it up then just get
in there with a spoon.
It's just like the most gorgeous sludge you
can get.
So I'm gonna put half in and I'm just gonna
lay that...into our mold, and then we've got
really nice quality 70 percent chocolate.
Give it a spank and then I want about 60 g.
Just little chunks and I'll save half for
on top, and then marmalade.
That lovely bitter sweet orange and the chocolate,
fantastic.
So just about 60 g...in and around here.
So there you go.
A really easy, delicious desert ready to be
cooked.
In it goes.
Look at that.
You've still got a little wobble in the middle,
which I like.
Here we go.
Crispy on the top.
Gorgeous.
Little bit of ice cream.
Mm, that is the chocolate marmalade panattone
bread and butter pudding.
A beautiful thing that anyone can do that
tastes absolutely delicious.
