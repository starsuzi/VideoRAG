you know what I haven't had in a long
time cuz uh you know you hear organ
Meats aren't that good for you but once
in a blue moon and this is the Blue Moon
we're going to have some nice and The
Price is Right too some Cales
liver uh cooked with uh bacon and
[Music]
onions because just cooked
alone
isn't that great so for me the living
needs a little help so we first
do I slice the
bacon cut it in
[Music]
pieces sauté it with the
onion you need herbs with this no C
liver has a a wonderful taste all by
itself and the only thing that we do
have to add to that is just a little bit
of salt and
pepper and I got a salt and pepper mix I
always tell people about this this
is sea salt and if you can look at it it
has black pepper in it that I put in
there but the color of the sea salt
isn't that white which is good that
means it's not as refined as other crap
so we put a little in there and then
we're going to put a little on the uh
liver too so all we got to do is just
sort this
first now it's up to you if you like
crispy crispy
uh bacon so just cook it now I'm not
going to waste film on watching this
this is not a big deal to some people so
that's a low
Flame
raise it up just a little so it's a
moderate frame and I'll just go about
cooking this until the Bacon's done and
the onions are I'm going take it out
leave the fat in there dust the liver
season the liver dust it in flour so it
gets a nice
finish simple you know I was going to
make this simple like this but I totally
changed my mind I found something in the
refrigerator that's going to work very
nicely with this and that
is heavy cream
and it will deaz the
pan look how nice that's
working we're going to take
this just put this into a
bowl so you lose a little bit of the
cream
cuz now we're going to go and clean this
pan cuz you really can't sauté it in
this the way it
is so now we can
sauté uh we need to season The
View so into this we'll put a little
salt and
pepper and do both
sides and you can either use
oil or
butter or a little bit of both I've had
too much butter already so I'm going
with just the olive
oil and people don't like to use olive
oil don't use your other oil uh do
whatever you want mix it or don't mix it
now this has to be a little bit hot
because caves liver doesn't take long to
cook and you don't want to overcook it
but there are some people that going to
eat this well done
anyway but not me and not a lot of other
people
so we just dust this in
flour like
so and get all the pieces ready because
these three pie P are going in there now
this is enough for three people that are
watching their
weight or two people that are hungry cuz
this does shrink up a lot and this was
like
a like I describe 11 oz it seems like
more but it's
not so that's what you do and now as you
see it's smoking now it's time to put it
in and what we're going to do is
after a little bit on one side and the
other we're going to take it
out and pour off any excess
fat like I said this is not going to
take long so we're going to keep the
uh the film
going
is another one I like the only problem
is like 30 40 years ago you could find
this liver nowadays you
[Music]
can't and the flour gives it a nice
finish a little more
Flame
and when it's done then we're going to
toss the
onions back
in notice how nice it looks
put the fan on so we
don't with all the cooking I do have to
paint the ceiling here in the
kitchen once
every 2 years it's
unavoidable unless you have the exhaust
that goes out the building which this
isn't all it does is
just go over your head
and all the little particles are F just
find their way stick to
anything now this is
like a piece of steak lower the
flame I'm going to eat
two and there not going to be a lot of
uh
onion and that's it let put this back
in now the amount of heavy cream that I
put in I bet you we lost about 30% of
it
I did say we're going to pour the grease
off but you know what it wasn't that
much and it's olive
oil okay that's it we're
done shut that
off put that on a
plate that's my dinner right
there and that's enough bacon and onion
mix for me and we'll save that for the
next
person and now all we have to do is
just cut into
it I'll show
you the
color I want to put it directly on top
of that
burner so how's that and we get a KN and
it looks
pretty little chopped parsley on there
that would go
well and that's how you want to eat
this
good been years since I had that I hope
you enjoy it
