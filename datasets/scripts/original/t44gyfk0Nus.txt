Hey Guys Welcome Back to another episode
My name is Ali Haider Rehman
& today i am going to show you the easiest method
of drawing a hyperrealistic eye
its a step by step process so i would suggest that
you don't just skim through this whole video
and waste your time.
if you really wanna do something
Grab a paper
Follow the instructions in this video
i bet you'll end up with an amazing eye drawing of yours
So without any further delay, lets get started !
We're going to use these 4 types of pencils in this video
If you don't have these specific pencils,
you can use a little darker or a light shade
for example if you don't have this 5B pencil
you can use a 4B or 6B pencil
it'll work the same!
I already drew this simple outline
to minimize the time duration of this video
so lets start by drawing a simple light outline
now i am going to fill retina with 7B pencil
okay, lets darken the outline of the iris
now i'm going to add these small lines
around the retina
lets shade the iris with back-&-fourth stroke technique
I'm using the same B pencil for this shading
okay, lets blend these shading with a dry brush
now i'm going to add these small textures
inside the iris
you don't have to follow the same reference
just add some random textures and shapes a you like
and you are good to go !
now i'm a dding these small lines around the iris
make sure to keep them inside the iris
now adding the same lines around the retina
As you can see the texture in this small portion is ready
now follow the same steps for whole process
looks cool right ?
now take your 5B pencill and add some darker shade
around the iris
lets blend the shade with the same
dry brush technique
Now take a sharp eraser
and highlight these faded areas inside the iris
By the way,  its a Tombow MONO Zero eraser
and i'll provide an amazon link in the description
or you can make a replica at home
just click this 'i' button here, after this video.
as we are done with the highlights
now take your 6H or whatever H grade you have
and make a perfect shape
of this rectangular highlight.
now add some shadow on the upper part of iris
lets clear this highlight and add
some reflection of eye-lashes
actually drawing with a lighter pencil
and then making it darker is the perfect method
to avoid any unremovable mistakes
lets darken the reflection with 7B pencil.
okay the iris is almost ready
lets add some base shade in the white portion
with the same B pencil
now blending with a dry brush
lets add some darker shade in the corner
because we need this eye to pop out of the page
and look more realistic and 3D
blending the shade smoothly
its time to add some blood-vessels in white portion
using the same b pencil
or you can use a mechanical pencil with HB leads
for more precision and accuracy
by the way, you can skip this step
if you dont want these vessels in your drawing
Repeat the same process on the other side
now lets shade the upper eyelid, so that
we can add some eyelashes on it
blending the shades
now start with some small hairs
because this portion of eyelashes always have small hairs
i'm drawing a rough sketch of these hairs first
now lets darken these hairs with a 5B pencil
you can add a light shade on the eyslashes
for better results
Now add some dark shade on the eye-lid
and you can also add these small hairs
with a mechanical pencil
to make it more realistic
lets repeat the same process for lower eye-lid
shading the lower eye-lid with an HB pencil
and blending the shade
adding some highlights like this in lower portion
and some white dots here
by the way, you can use a white pigment marker
or a whitener for better results
blend the lower eyelid with a brush
you don't have to add some shade here
now add some darker shade on the lower eyelid
and blend it smoothly
also add some highlights here on the upper eyelid
and for the lower eyelid
yoy can use a pigment marker or a whitener
but as i don't have one yet
so i'll use my MONO eraser for these highlights
and here you go !
its looks better i think !
now add these wrinkles here and blend them
with a stump or you can use you finger if you want
so moving on to the final step which is
adding some skin texture
lets add some white dots with MONO eraser
and it will look cool
lets darken some of these hairs to get a perfect contrast
