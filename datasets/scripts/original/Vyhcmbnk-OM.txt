hello everybody I'm Sarah and this is my
first video on YouTube and I am so
excited so I thought I should do
something fun for my first video so I'm
going to I'm going to be teaching you
guys how to make colored sand so here's
what you'll need some table
salt um some bowls I recommend styrofoam
bowls so you don't ruin your
B okay um container to store it in I got
this at the dollar store s these I just
ran out of these ones so I'm using
this a funel it's optional you don't
have to use
it something to mix with I have I'm
using a spoon and some plastic sticks
but what plastic it's not plastic wooden
it wooden yeah it's popsicle sticks I'm
so confused like I'm so excited I'm just
getting so confused so I have some
examples these I mixed up oh yeah food
coloring um these um I mixed these
up I don't know why I just Ed so much
blue on this
one this one I have a lot of green I
shook them up you don't have to shake
them up and these you don't want to take
them out and play with it obviously you
can just poke at it so let's get to
it so first I have I'm going to have my
balls going to start off with
one and I'm going to put some salt in it
put the salt
in okay that's good now I'm going to put
some food coloring and this is like a
pink three drops is
enough spoons and forks like they're
really good for like pushing
down okay I'm not doing this good cuz
I'm just looking through the camera to
see me a little more
have the spoon push it down a little bit
so you want to like smush them down
right away cuz they'll just Harden and
they'll turn into like a little hard
bits see this that's what the spoon is
good
for you do that for a second
teeny tiny bit
more just a tiny
[Music]
bit so if you want to stop you can stop
wherever you want if you want it to be
really light like this you can stop
right here but you want to make sure you
don't have any of these chunks
if you want a darker color you can use
more food coloring cuz we use the neon
colors cuz we want brighter
colors so yeah this one is kind of like
an IC color cuz I yeah I add I added
more salt when it was in so
now we are going to put it in the
container if you're using containers
like this you want to use the funnel but
since I'm since I'm using a container
that is like more wide I'm going to be
using nothing I'm just going to dump it
in you know what actually I might want
to use this so I'll put it
and see this it just makes it go a lot
slower this is what I do I just go like
this I go like
that if you're afraid you're going to
get it all over your place you're yeah
that's why you use your
funnel and if you're like doing it on
the floor or on the table and you don't
want anything getting all over the place
I recommend using
[Music]
this I also recommend using a place
mat flatten it down a little
bit if you want it to be just one color
you can I'm going to layer it I'm going
to do two colors I'm not going to do the
blue because we don't have that much we
only have like two drops okay next color
okay this like the neon yellow it shows
up
green where is this oh yeah you're
getting the
thing she's just getting the stuff off
of it the other color
going do that to the
fork everyone says your first video is
always very short it's not even a
minute this is long
so this I think like if you want to
color like this use like five drops five
or six
drops cuz I use five or six I don't
know oh when I made this one I gave it a
name I called it Arctic rush cuz it's
blue and it has some white in
it and I don't know why there's other
colors
too
yeah now we going to wait make sure this
color is a little
flat now we add
this I'm going do three colors yeah I'm
going to do three
and you're going to spread it
out you can also buy like little kits
for this but this is a lot
cheaper okay next
color I think this is going to be the
last
color next
good
enough now I'm going to add this
color and that's about six drops
so we finished the purple and we put it
in the container
so now we're done I want to poke at
it that's pretty much all you can do
with it plus it's great
art so yeah this is my final product
yeah so couple of shout outs shout out
to my good friend Kea cuz she told me I
should do DIYs and stuff for my channel

that and shout out to my mom for the
