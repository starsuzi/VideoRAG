hi I'm Sami with TNS Plumbing I got
called to this job I had a a shower that
got some water backing up into it when
they use the laundry room I already
suspect what the problem is but we'll
have to go inside and take a look see
what we got I came here and we found out
that there's a shampoo bottle that was
dumped in the shower most of it was
dumped in there and I ran everything
flush toilets put toilet paper on the
toilet ran the shower and we couldn't
get it to back up at the time so I
assumed the shampoo was in the P trap
and it backed up because of that reason
the homeowner used the washer and as she
used used the washer she came into this
bathroom to look at this shower and and
the washer was backing up into the
shower so what we're going to do here is
we're going to pull the toilet we're
going to put the camera down there maybe
we'll be able to see what's down there
clogging the drain line
and here there's light on the end of
this thing outside in the middle that's
where the lens is okay here we go we're
going to shove this camera head down
into the drain
line there we can start
seeing inside of the pipe that's the
side of the pipe
there fitting there it's full water but
it's clear water so we can still
see there we ran into the
clog of some kind I can still push and
then that that's it there's probably the
clog right
there this huge drum spins which spins
his cable that's
[Music]
inside he went off
that means I open the clog so that water
is
gone you can hear it you can hear it in
the drainy
W drain pretty clearly now and you can
see how dirty see all that crust that's
what we want to clean with the jedar
you can see the um the pipe is a lot
cleaner than it was when we first put
our camera down
there still going to have rust cuz the
cast iron pipe it's going to be a little
rough you won't get that out of there
but you won't get all those flakies
hanging around all over to catch debris
[Music]
this was a job that we had the shower
backing up in we found out that about 35
ft from the toilet there was a major
clog uh we ended up uh taking a jedar
and cleaned it all up and we camera the
line everything looked clean and good
and we're all set ready to go
