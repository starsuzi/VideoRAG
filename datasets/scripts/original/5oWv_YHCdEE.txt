glue borax liquid starch and all the
other ingredients you need to get to
make slime so yeah so please have a like

the comments down below give us some new
ideas so let's get right into the video
okay guys so what you will need to make
this slime is hand soap I'm using soft
soap you'll also need
flour you'll also need a bowl or a plate
to make your slime
in and last but not least you'll need a
mixing tool so let's get making some
slime okay guys so the first step you're
going to do is take out your bowl or
plate you're going to add your hand
soap I'm going to add around five
pumps four five
okay and The Next Step you'll do is
you'll take out your flour I'm actually
using allpurpose flour you're going to
add it into your hand
soap I'm going to sprinkle it
over now I'm going to take out my
toothpick I'm going to start mixing
you're going to see that like the flour
is going to dissolve into the soap and
that's actually a good
thing you see it's going to get very
thick and you want it to get thick so it
can turn into
slime so
yeah add a little bit
more so I'm going to keep
mixing this actually takes a while to do
so I'm probably going to fast forward
this basically need two ingredients to
make this in a mixing bowl and like a
mixing
tool look it's already like all sticky
and stuff you guys can see this see all
the flowers like dissolving in
that's so cool going
everywhere so guys I'm going to get
mixing all this so I will be back so
next part will be fast
forward okay guys so I just finished
making the slime and here it is and just
saying I use that entire container of
flour and I'm pretty happy with how it
is and I use so much
soap and it's very sticky and smells
like
flour you know dug I added
flour and yeah it doesn't make the
poking slime really see cuz it get so
sticky but like I'm planning on like
maybe like doing something with this
slime slime like maybe when I'm done
like showing you guys this I want to
turn into maybe like fluffy Slime by
adding some shaving cream or something
maybe it would help but you know at
least I made slime you know now you guys
don't really have to go out to the store
and buy glue cuz you know now you have
ingredients in your house you might have
to make slime so this is how you make
slime without glue borax liquid starch
