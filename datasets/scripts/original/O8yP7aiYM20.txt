all right welcome back to episode two of
are there bugs in my flower if you
happen to have caught the first
episode there there there were bugs on
my
flower so uh now I have another bag I
found it in the
cabinet it's also shop right oh no no
this one's stoping shop I'm sorry got to
share the blame here got to be fair to
everybody I want Stop and Shop flower
uh it's been in the cabinet it it
couldn't have been in there too long I
don't know how long but certainly less
than a year and so the big question is
will there be bugs in my flower all
right let's take a look as you can see
this bag has not been
open that bag has not been opened at
all
okay so uh no tears in there oh I'm
mistaken I do see some flower coming out
there is a little hole
there so I suppose something could have
gotten in I see there little little hole
there all right let's take a look but
certainly the package was never
opened per se all right let's take a
look are there bugs in my flare
hopefully you can hear the
teage so I'm ripping that
open tough to do it with one hand as I
hold the
camera but I think I'll be able to do it
okay open that open there I should have
a little music playing while I'm doing
this I don't want you to get bored okay
so will there be bugs in my
flower and yep yep we got bugs yep yep
we got bugs in there yeah there are bugs
in my
flower yes they are they're have a
little party all they need is a little
music and they'll be dancing the night
away but uh yeah
yeah there are bugs in there all
right so I did a little research on the
internet those are called
weevils weevils we v i l I believe that
that's what we're looking at so it's not
just one particular
brand not just one brand you see that in
many different brands and uh if I blame
shop right wrongly I certainly apologize
because they
are in multiple
Brands what I read is that really what
you should do is you should freeze your
flour freeze the
flour uh that will kill the larae which
inevitably get into most brands and then
the larvae will never grow into
fullblown B
bugs but there you have it there you
have it yeah another
brand it's my wife if you heard her
taking a look at the bugs there so again
last time it was shop right this time it
is stoping shop and it just sort of
proves the point that you can find
Weevil bugs
in many different brands of
flour so perhaps good advice that I read
on the internet to First freeze your
flow which will kill the
larae and then you could
avoid well the title of my video bugs in
your
flower
