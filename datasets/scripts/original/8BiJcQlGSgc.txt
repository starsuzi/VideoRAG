hi I'm going to make something called
cold
porcelain it's a type of
a air dried
clay you'll
need potato starch or corn starch or
whatever you
have
white schol
glue for you guys in America it's Elmer
[Music]
glue baby
[Music]
oil and lemon juice the real lemon is
better but I don't have it so I'm going
to
improvise and that's it you you need
some kind of a bucket or
a bowl or something that you don't mind
when it gets ruined because you will use
glue
so it's not a good idea to use something
that uh is used for food and some kind
of a mixing
tool I will measure out cup and
a/4 of uh
starch and you have to be really
careful because the
starch flies
[Music]
everywhere
[Music]
quarter and now the
[Music]
glue and we are going to
[Music]
need whole cup of
[Music]
glue
[Music]
and we will add one
tablespoon of lemon
[Music]
juice the lemon juice is there
so that the clay
doesn't
spoil
and then 1
tablespoon of the baby
[Music]
oil you can always add more if it's
needed
and now we will mix
it
[Music]
thoroughly so at the end I think I put
two cups of starch in there
and it's like
this you're going
to dump it on your
surface and knead it as
though it's a good idea
to oil your surface before you will need
it so it doesn't
[Music]
stick and you want to oil your hands
or use
these
[Music]
gloves
[Music]
he
you want to knad it till it doesn't
stick it is
still a little bit
[Music]
sticky I think this is little too dry
now
[Music]
so I'm going to add a little
bit of
[Music]
the
[Music]
[Music]
oil and when you're done
you will rub it in
the
[Music]
oil and put it in the
airtight
container it should be good
for I think if you put it in the fridge
it should be
good for a month I
[Music]
think so I have
these
molds they are perfect
for for Halloween I have Jack Lantern
bat
[Music]
ghost Kitty
and I think this is
Hulk but you can use it as a
Frankenstein
[Music]
monster all you'll do is just take a
little piece of the
clay and smoosh it in
[Music]
[Music]
there
[Music]
there are several ways to color this
clay either you could take a little bit
and take a
marker and just color it like
this but then the color will be
really
[Music]
subtle but I much prefer doing it
another
way let me
[Music]
just right this real tight so no air can
get into
it I will have to really dry completely
before I'll try to take it out because
it's really soft now but I have
some already made
here and as you can
see they are really
hard and how I colored them this these
two these two are colored with a black
marker
and you can see they are kind of
marbled I will take a pictures and show
you later but these two I colored with a
marker but after they will dry so when
it's dry you will just take a marker and
go over
it just like you would color with color
f pencils or I don't
know and then you would take a black
marker and just go
over the eyes the
nose and the
mouth it doesn't even have to be
[Music]
permanent I've done that with just a
regular markers and it's fine you can
glue a magnet on the back and you will
have nice magnets on the
fridge and if you don't want it you can
make a jewelry out of
it
just uh make a hole before it's dry
before then you would have to drill into
it
or glue
the the
pieces
afterwards and that's it for today so
thank you for
watching happy Halloween have a lot of
candy and take care
bye
