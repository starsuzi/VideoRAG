Hey guys, so in today's video I am going to be talking about how to get your hamster to chew on its chew toys
I often get a ton of comments asking. How do I get my hamster to chew on its wooden chews?
It has no interest. I've tried everything. What do I do?
so it is really important for your hamster to be chewing on different materials such as
Wood because their front incisors actually never stop growing so they need to chew on things to help wear them down
now, of course, they need to be chewing on safe things and they should not be chewing on things like plastic items or
Cage bars. That is not healthy or good for your hamster to be chewing on
So the first thing I recommend is to try a variety of chews
Don't just try one wooden chew And then think your hamsters never gonna want to chew on anything else
try a variety of things because every hamster is of course different some will like chewing on
Certain chews while others may not so try a variety of different types
There are different types of wood kinds of chews and there is sea grass types
You can also try things like these mineral chews
But these really should only be given as kind of like a treat. hamsters don't need no mineral or calcium
Stones because they should be getting all of the vitamins and minerals in their diet
So this is just kind of unnecessary, but you can try it to see if your hamster does like chewing on it
But it shouldn't be given to them 24/7
So my first tip to try and get your hamster to chew on different things is a whole walnut here
these have a very very hard shell so it
Kind of takes the hamster quite a while to maybe even break it up open
Some hamsters can't even break them open, but they will generally chew along the edges of them
So that is good for the teeth because it is hard. It is perfectly safe because walnuts are safe for hamsters to eat
so the next tip I have is
taking the wooden stick type chews and putting these in your Hamster's seed mix and you can leave it in there for however long
you want but basically it's going to get the scent of your hamster seed mix onto this little stick and
Your hamster might be more intrigued to chew on it because it's gonna smell like their regular seed mix
the next thing you can try of course is one of the most popular tips I can give is to take a little bit of
Peanut butter and to scrape it onto the chew and then scrape it off that way
it is getting the scent of that peanut butter onto the chew and
That's gonna make the hamster more likely to chew on it because it's gonna smell like peanut butter so that can help a lot
Something similar to the peanut butter hack is to take any type of berries. So blueberries raspberries strawberries
To mush them up and then add a lot of water to it
you can even put it in the microwave to heat it up to help the juices mix with the water and then you soak a
wooden chew in there
Of course
You're gonna want to soak it for a couple of hours and then take it out and let it air dry
But then it's going to taste more  berry-ish to the hamster so it can help make them chew it
So these last couple of tips that I have are towards more edible
Chews so these shouldn't be given more than once or twice a month
so the first thing I have here is a whimsee dog chew, these are perfectly safe for
Hamsters, they have minimal ingredients in them so they are safe. But basically it is a hard dog chew and
Hamsters absolutely love them. So these can be good to help wear down your hamsters teeth. Of course
I don't give more than one a month due to the fact that it is edible and generally they are fairly big
So you don't want your hamster should just be constantly eating this another thing
That's really similar to the whimzee dog chews is cheesy chews. These generally are sold in Walmart or Petco
I think but these are made for small animals and they kind of taste like cheese
I'm pretty sure and it's in the shape of a cheese
Hamster generally also like these but of course, I wouldn't give it more than once a month in the last one
You can try out to help wear down your hamsters teeth is dog biscuits now try to go for the
most organic least ingredient dog treat that you can find
these are really good because
Generally, they're fair a fairly decent size and they are fairly hard so it is good for your hamsters teeth
So yeah, guys, those are all of the tips that I can give to try and get your hamster to chew more
My main tip is just to give a variety of options try different chews because sometimes some hamsters prefer
Different wood chews over the other even though they're both made out of wood. Sometimes they just prefer a different type
So, yeah guys. Thank you for watching. Bye
