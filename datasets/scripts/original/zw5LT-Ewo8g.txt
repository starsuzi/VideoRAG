Bottlight is a revolutionary project
that will change forever the concept of
bottle lamp.
You have seen other bottle lamps before,
but none of them have the innovative
features of Bottlight.
Open the package, plug the USB cable into
the bottle, touch its top and control
the light to change the atmosphere
around you.
Bottlight is the first and only bottle
lamp in the world with touch gestures
applied to the top.
Each Bottlight is unique and entirely
handmade and reproduces the color of
your favorite drink, while the QR code
and the sensor inside guarantee the
uniqueness of each piece for the
happiness of collectors.
We started by recycling empty bottles
because the end of the party is never
the end of the party for us
You had the fun and now we want to give
you the magic by applying our innovative
touch gestures to the top.
Every single day we work to add new
features to Bottlight because this is
just the beginning
the second version of Bottlight will be
something that you can't now even
imagine.
Hi my name is Daniele Ciattaglia CEO of Bottlight. 
When we started this project
our focus was to create a unique product
different from any other bottle lamps
that you can find around the world, 
and today we can finally and proudly
present to you the most innovative bottle lamps that has ever been created. 
The top is
the controller of your Bottlight. 
Touch once to power on and off. Hold the finger
on the top to dim the light and set your
favorite intensity. Touch twice to go
full light. On the colors version you can
also swipe the finger to swap between
different colors. You can change the
environment around you with one simple
gesture, as if your finger was a magic
wand.
Please help us making Bottlight a
reality
thank you for your support share and Touch the top.
Bottlight. Touch the Top!
