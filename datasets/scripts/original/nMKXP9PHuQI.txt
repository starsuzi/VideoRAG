hi guys it's Edie with raw Mama nature
we're actually going to have lunch today
and we're going to make papaya salad or
sunum which is a um pretty traditional
Thai Dish and we're normally have this
for lunch with sticky rice and other
grill food and it's kind of raw really
healthy and refreshing and it's really
popular so I want to show you how to
make it authentically and also how you
can replace a few ingredients and make
it really raw so um we normally use
green papaya and you can find this at
the Asian grocery store if not you can
use carrots um apples and other
vegetables that you like and you would
shred it into little thin um noodles and
I'll show you later so we have that as a
base and then we use a lot of lime juice
tomato cherry tomatoes and um garlic and
a Thai chili or any kind of chili you
want but this is really really spicy so
you're probably not going to need it you
can use other type of like jalapeno or
something just to spice it up according
to how spicy you want your dish to be
and then you would use um traditionally
we would use roasted peanuts and
you might you might want to replace that
with maybe pistachios I have here pine
nuts um use almond
butter um Jungle peanuts anything that
you like and you can add some nutty
flavor into it um and to make it tasty
so we
have lime and bitter and spicy here then
we would use normally we use fish
sauce and we could replace it with Nam
showyou or coconut raw coconut aminos or
just salt and then for sweeteners we
used the um pure palm sugar in the
traditional way if not you can just use
coconut syrup honey or any other
sweetener you
like so I'll peel the papaya cut it up
remove all the
seeds and then we would use the
slicer make it easy but I wanted to make
sure that you know that this green
papaya is different from the sweet
papaya that you would buy from a grocery
store you have to find this at the Asian
grocery
store so we're going to start
with garlic put in a glove of garlic I'm
going to use maybe just half of the Thai
Chili Pepper cuz it's really really hot
and
spicy and then um handful of
pistachio this is like you can make a
party out of this because if you prepare
all the ingredients your friends can
make their own papaya salad and you can
adjust to your liking like if you some
people really like get um a lot of
garlic some people love a lot of lime
and you know you just play with it and
very sweet or not sweet so I'm going to
use the palm sugar because it just this
is just pretty pure cuz it's only palm
sugar and water and if you want to be
really careful about the ingredients you
can use the coconut the raw coconut
crystals or the coconut syrup but I'm
going to use pom sugar and I kind of
like my papaya salad to be sweet and
Tangy so we
use that and you're going to crush
it the authentic Tha Sal Thum actually
has dry shrimp in it and also string
beans but I don't have any string beans
and then we're going to add the
papaya a handful of
papaya a little bit of
carrot and then we're just going to do
this with the drying ingredient first so
we not splashing the liquid into our
face so now we have sweet we have the
lime juice we have the bitter and the
spicy we have the Nutty fatty flavor
we're going to add salty now so that
let's use the coconut
aminos or
salt C little salt mixed it
well now we're just going to add some
Tomatoes at the
end this is so simple and really
tasty please try and let me know what
you think we're going to go enjoy this
outside again until next time
bye-bye
