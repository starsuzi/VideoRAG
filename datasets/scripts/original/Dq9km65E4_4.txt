hello everyone welcome back in this
episode I will show you guys how I did
all these mer Sky glasses made from the
Dollar Tree actually I just cleaned the
glass and spray painted and that's the
effects that I got into bed I don't have
very good lighting but actually the
video does not does it justice it does
nothing actually in real life it is
beautiful so I will show you guys how I
created these just keep so what I did I
added uh one part vinegar and and one
part water I got this spray bottle at uh
Ikea and you're also going to need your
kryon looking glass mirror like
paint I purchased this uh spray band at
uh Walmart for
$8.99 and you're going to find your jar
of your choice uh this is an old
recyclable uh Yankee Candle that that I
just cleaned and
depotted um what I did was I cleaned the
inside with some
Windex and you're going to have to shake
your Looking Glass uh spray paint for at
least 2 minutes so now that my can is
already uh shooken up I am going to
spray it
[Music]
[Music]
and as you
see it's all the liquid inside or all
the paint
I'm going to take my water and
vinegar and just sprad it
now with my
napkin I'm just going to dab it
[Music]
inside and it is a little messy
and I am loving the look so far now
we're going to let this sit for 10
minutes and we're going to repeat the
process so it has been 10 minutes and so
far it looks great just as this but I
want to make it more
vintage so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to repeat the same process all
over again and try to capture the spots
that I have missed if you could see
there I don't like that so let's try it
again I did this great mercury glass
vase off from the Dollar Tree I actually
connected one vase to the candle holder
with my E6000 I let that dry overnight
for 24 hours I'm going to do now is I've
been doing a few mercury glass
myself and I find that weding first the
base will work better for me or it gives
it a better look
so I did try to do it how I was
instructed with vinegar and water and
whatnot
I actually didn't like the smell or the
scent that it left so I tried it out
with water just plain old water and I am
going to just spray
inside and I don't know if you guys can
see this
but that's the look I like we're going
to
shake we're going to shake the uh spray
paint for about 2
minutes so once it's sprayed I am going
to try to spray it
[Music]
inside and I'm going to let that dry off
for about 10 minutes okay it's been 10
minutes this is how it's actually
looking which I like it already but I'm
going to do a second cool to
[Music]
it and with my bottle
