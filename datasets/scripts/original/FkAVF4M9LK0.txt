everybody welcome back and I know I know
I normally do car stuff but I'm a big
avid pool fan as well and one of the
things that I have is I have a table at
home and I have these fancy these are
centennial Brunswick Falls and these are
very pricey and I've been noticing a lot
of skids lately and I'm probably
wondering what a skid at a skid is is
when the cue ball the where you you
aiming for the ball to go this way but
it actually sticks for a split second
and then let's go and then goes in the
wrong direction so that that is duck
task in there's a lot of theories as to
why that is but I think the most
plausible theory is that you get a lot
of chalk dust on the cue ball on the
table and then that gets transferred to
the balls and what happens is is that
chalk sticks to it just forever brief
second and you'll see it you'll see the
ball contact and then stick for a second
and then shoot off in one direction or
the other and they usually screws up
your shot so skids are bad that's why
you got to keep clean balls I want to
make sure I polish them up but they're
you know they're round and you can't
really it's hard to polish her round
object easily with your hands and a
regular ball polisher is gonna run you
at 250 300 bucks so basically he got
myself a bucket got myself a cheapo da
orbital buffer with a free soft pad on
it and then I've got a piece of carpet
over here that I've kind of taped in the
shape now a couple of improvements you
could I don't want to that's mine it's
my new bucket I don't want to ruin it so
I don't want to cut holes in it although
so you could cut holes in it if that
doesn't quite fit the cylinder that
you're gonna be putting it in but for me
this fits just fine
and of course you know I get a smaller
one a you know attachment but proof of
concept is that it works so basically
just gonna drop it kind of straight down
here so you got nice and nice and tight
in there I've already got the trigger
kind of taped down on that side
and I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my
carpet like yeah okay now take a couple
couple balls fill er up
does shiny balls a happy ball am i right
okay so I filled it up there and then
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead
and plug it in to watch
works better it's level
I'm spinning around there
[Applause]
it's whisper-quiet yeah you let it go
for five or ten minutes
and I could put something in the middle
here to you know agitate them you know
something this
basically
concept is I just want to get a nice
even polish all the way around so and
the very end you get my back
well and there you have it nice shiny
ball it looks a million times better
look at that gorgeous anyway thanks for
sticking with me subscribe at the bottom
have a good one
hope this was helpful you could also use
this to polish up the things too I just
happen to be using pool balls here but
especially if you got a lot of if you
got a round object you want to throw it
in there and tumble it around and the
best part is I take I take this apart
I still got my bucket
