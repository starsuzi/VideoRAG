I'm going to show you how to make the
wonderfully refreshing Moscow Mule a
wonderful drink for summer but it also
works through winter as well because of
the spiciness and the firness of the
ginger beer now kick things off with 300
M of
Vodka it's probably best that you
measure these things
out which is what I'm doing now pouring
my vodka Into The Jug so that we can
share it with all our friends and family
there we go just to Splash more
like so fantastic to that I'm going to
add 15 dashes of angerer bitters this
stuff is phenomenal it's great for
making drinks more balanced and to give
you a really depth of flavor because
it's got lots of different herbs and
spices as well as a slightly alcoholic
kick so 15 dashes I hope you're
counting there we go to that I'm going
to add in 75 Ms of freshly squeezed lime
juice squeeze it just at the last minute
really make sure you get that fresh
Sharp that you want from your limes okay
I've measured that out it's 75
Ms in we go topping that off with my
favorite ingredient in the whole
universe spicy ginger beer
delicious pour that in
there also if you're going to make
drinks for summer and it is a warm day
what you want to make sure is that
there's plenty of ice in your jug you
don't want it to melt in the Heat and
get really dilute so I'm just going to
top that back
up like so
and while I'm at it I'm going to add a
little bit of ice to my glass as well so
that when you give it to somebody you
don't have to pour the ice out it's
already there in the
glass there we are going to give that a
little stir just to make sure it's all
mixed through
nicely like
so then just top up the glasses as
required that looks fantastic
just to make it look even more fantastic
what I'm going to do is add in a sprig
of mint going to give that a quick slap
just to wake up the
aromatics and then add in your classic
lime
wedge there you have a wonderful Bosco
mule
