hello namaste
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at
Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to
make chicken chimichanga, this is very
easy to make you know here I've got some chicken which I have boiled in my
chicken stock
ok and all you need to do is just shred the chicken for the chimichanga and this
chicken is very nicely cooked so it's
very easy to shred them out the chicken
is all shredded and this is what i'm going to use in my chimichanga because
this is cooked in the stock it's very
flavorful and rest of the ingredients are
allready so we are ready to make chimichanga. For this just put this refried
beans you know if you want to make your
chimichangas thin you can make little you
can add little less but I want my chimichangas to be nice and fat here on this you know
put this shredded chicken you know whenever i'm making it for myself at home a lot
of chicken goes into making my
chimichanga and now on this put guacamole
haha you know spread it and wow this is
good on this add some salsa in this add
some sour cream just fold it in the
center like this
ok lot of people don't even add egg
white but I love to make sure that this
is sealed properly you know they just
roll it and put it in hot oil and they
feel somehow I don't feel comfortable
doing that so I'm just going to apply a
little bit of egg white on this so that
this seals the chimchangas properly then
fall it and
here here just press the stuffing inside
and put this top tortilla and pull it
back and because there is egg white here it's going to seal properly
this is nice and round chimichangas in the  hot oil and we're going to cook till
they're nice and crispy; these chicken
chimichangas
Wow mm-hmm
what a stuffing what a stuffing wow make this tortillas fresh as I've shown and your chimichangas
will be super awesome
