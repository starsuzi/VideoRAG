I'm so glad to have you
here for today's recipe.
This is one that my family loves.
And even though I have picky eaters,
who typically don't like a
lot of their foods touching
or mixed, this recipe is always a win.
At a first glance, you might think
this is a chili mac and
cheese, but it's not.
There's no chili and no
beans in this recipe.
I'm using fire roasted
tomatoes to give this dish
a smoky Southwestern flavor,
but if you don't have any around,
use regular diced
tomatoes, other than that,
we have basic ingredients that I know
you probably have on hand,
which is another reason this recipe
is in my regular rotation at my house.
So, let's get started by
sauteing the onions in a skillet.
So, once they've softened,
we're gonna add the paprika,
Italian seasoning, a little
salt and black pepper.
Let's just saute this for
an additional minute or two
to make sure that the onion
takes on the flavors from the spices.
Next we're gonna cook the ground beef.
Now you can use ground
turkey or ground chicken
for this recipe if you'd like.
You just want to break
up the meat as it cooks
until the meat has cooked through.
Then, we add the garlic, crushed tomatoes,
diced tomatoes, and water.
Let's give this a quick stir
and bring it to a simmer.
This dish is great,
because you can make it
ahead of time if needed.
Leftovers keep in the fridge
for three to four days,
and I think that they taste
so much better the next day.
If you're wondering why I
don't have the pasta cooking,
it's because the pasta is going to cook
right into the beef and tomato mixture.
All you need to do is
take this oven safe pan
and place it in the oven
for about 22 minutes
until the pasta is tender
and it has absorbed most of the sauce.
The final step is to add the cheese
and cover it for a minute or two
until the cheese has melted.
Whoa, I can't wait to dig in
and show you, cheesy, meaty.
