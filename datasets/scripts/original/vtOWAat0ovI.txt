this is my how firts two and a half ton
trolley Jack it's been running out of
oil for a long time now so that's some
jaco island instructions say lower to
Jack to the lowest position so we're
already there remove the filler plug
which I guess is somewhere underneath
here see a little red plug they're
interested in trying to catch the fed up
look let's just do not adjust some seeds
under there
dolls on the back that says your mother
just another set up club
so there's your filler plug I think it
has this little rubber bung inside it it
just pops out with a screwdriver not
really sure I'm going to get it back in
both so my miniature funnel it says on
the instructions press pause if you want
filled with my brolic jack oil to not
use brake fluid fill it until it's 10 ml
below the federal level but unloaded
five or six times six billion inside the
pump unit
so seems simple enough at the moment I
can't see any oil in us
you
you can see oil I think it's just on the
cylinders opening another shot
the MOT my van went broke well Phil
yesterday so I've got to do a few jobs
so we can try and show you in that hole
you can see that there's something in
there but it might just be a tall it's a
layer children it doesn't change any
children so I'd say it's like a bit more
world's smallest funnel
so failed anyways on a front track rod
end near side on the left so that part
will be in this morning and I need the
jack to get the van up off the ground so
the symptom of this broken Jack was that
he only really got a little bit of the
end of the stroke each time
so every time you did it only raised up
maybe suppose a little there and we
raised up about five millimeters instead
of a good inch
put in about 50 milliliters so far so
inside push
Oh
just pump it again a few times
so what about 100 milliliters
now
well I'm risk filling so it's bad idea
we should have paid more attention there
it's open leaking out but that's okay I
just have been an air bubble drop
straight back in
equally we're pumping the oil into the
chamber so I should go down
as high as it goes
there it is going back up the topic so
we've got much more infiltrate
there's like it's so colorful that with
my tissue I do that and then plug it up
call it a job
we have been an oil about to shoot
this little plug
it's kinda much room so that it's there
entirely sure I have to make that fish
let's push it into the sweep over
such
Oh
seems okay to me
there you are that's where you put it in
on passwords one that's it that helped
