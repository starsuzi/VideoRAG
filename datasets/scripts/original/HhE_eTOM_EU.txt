Chocolate Martini Recipe
Hello, welcome once again 
to TheFNDC.com’s YouTube channel.
I am your bartending host, Jöhnny Dîablø.
And today, we’re making the Chocolate Martini.
What you’re going to need: Godiva Chocolate Liqueur,
dark creme de cacao,
half and half,
vanilla vodka, 
and Kahlúa if you want it. It’s optional.
Okay.
So, chilled martini glass —
We’ve got a shaker full of ice,
and we’re going to add — start by adding
 One and a half ounces of your Godiva Dark Chocolate Liqueur.
That one was half of an ounce.
Okay, one and a half ounces of the 
creme de cacao.
De Cocoa? I don’t know.
Somebody please teach me how to say that word correctly.
Okay...
1 ½ ounces there.
Okay, 
One ounce of vanilla vodka.
This is Smirnoff vanilla vodka, which I use 
in about half the drinks I make.
You’ll need 1 ½ ounces of half and half.
Alright, and then just a —
I’m just going to add a splash of Kahlúa.
If you don’t have any on hand, that’s OK.
Just a little bit.
OK, shake it up.
Nice and cold.
Strain it out...
Ooooh...
Look at that. Goodness.
Goodness in a cup.
Add a little bit of chocolate shavings,
which I got ready beforehand.
