hello and welcome to baking mad.com
kitchen I'm going to show you how to
make fairy cakes and it's a basic sponge
mixture like a Victoria sponge cake
mixture really um but for fairy cakes
I'm just using 100 gram of butter
softened butter at room temperature two
eggs 100 G of Silverspoon castor sugar
and 100 G of self-raising flour half a
teaspoon full of vanilla and a drop of
milk if I need it but before I do that
it's important to line the cake tin with
your cupcake or fairy cake cases now
there's quite a difference in cake case
size that's a muffin it's quite deep
That's a classic cupcake case and fairy
cake case is just a bit
smaller you can see it's quite a
difference in size there so just line
your tin with your fairy cake
cases and I say you can use the same
mixture if you're making cupcakes or
even and muffins
um but I'm just going to show you how to
make classic fairy cakes today if you're
doing cupcakes just increase the mixture
and you'll find all the recipes on the
baking mad.com
website so just add the
sugar to your butter and you can either
use a wooden spoon or I'm just going to
use an electric mixer so I won't talk
while this is mixing but the idea is to
cream this until it's really really
smooth and light and fluffy
don't rush this stage the longer you
take to whisk the butter and sugar until
it's really light and creamy the better
texture your uh cake will be cuz you've
got to incorporate lots of air and you
shouldn't feel any granules of sugar it
should be really really
creamy now I'm going to break four eggs
and whisk them gently and again they
should be at room temperature because if
you add Freez and cold eggs straight
from the fridge into your butter it will
just make the butter hard and you're
more likely to get the mixture curdled
make sure you beat your eggs really well
and then you're just going to add them
gradually a little bit at a time to your
creamed
mixture all right that's really light
and creamy and fluffy I'm going to add
just a teaspoon full of um vanilla
Essence to give it a really nice flavor
if you want to make a coffee cake you
can add a teaspoonful of strong coffee
if you want to make a lemon cake add
grated lemon rind or orange rind and if
you want to make a chocolate cakes take
out a tablespoonful of the flour and add
a tablespoonful of cocoa instead so it's
a really versatile
recipe so then I'm just going to fold
the flour
into the butter and sugar egg mixture
using a sort of figure of eight
motion so I'm going to divide the mixure
between my fairy cake cases and I
usually use um a dessert spoon not too
rounded for fairy cakes cuz we don't
want them too full
so
just dollop that into your fairy cake
cases if you're making cupcakes you want
want deeper cases and I would say a
heaped dessert spoonful of
mixture there we are so that goes in the
oven at 180c or 1860 fan for about 15 to
18 minutes until they're lovely and
golden so here are my fairy cakes all
baked and I just like to tip them up to
let them
cool and when they're completely cool
you just just decorate
them and what to make a fairy cake you
just with a knife just go around
the edge of the
cake I think it's much easier if you use
a little serrated
knife and take off the
top that then gets cut into two little
wings now you can either spread your
buttercream and I'm just using ordinary
vanilla
buttercream but you can obviously you
could use strawberry
buttercream chocolate buttercream and
you could also pipe it in there if you
want
to then you
just pop your wings on
top and a little dust of icing
sugar that is a classic fairy
cake
