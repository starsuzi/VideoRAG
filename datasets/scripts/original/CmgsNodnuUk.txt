greetings my beautiful lovelies it's
emmy welcome back today i'm going to be
tasting
this
the contents of this red box this is an
instant
hot pot so this just came to me in the
mail yesterday and it was sent to me by
matthew matthew thank you so much for
thinking of me and for sending this i
have never seen this before and what it
is is an instant hot pot now hot pot is
eaten all over asia in all different
forms but basically you have a communal
pot of broth different flavors of course
in different areas and then you add
vegetables and various meats and usually
it's served communally so everyone sits
around the table and dips their meats
and their vegetables and cooks them
together in this bubbling cauldron of
broth it's so much fun and absolutely
delicious
now this version looks like it's chinese
and
here are the instructions on the back
now i can't read chinese but these
instructions include illustrations it
looks like it has some kind of water
and you put two trays so i think this is
going to act a little bit like a double
boiler you're going to have the food on
top and the heating device below just
like you would if you're cooking
something tableside my one little
concern is that you're going to be
boiling and cooking at very high
temperatures in plastic
which
you know doesn't seem like such a great
idea but
i'm going to try it anyways so thanks
again matthew for sending this to me
let's go ahead and see what's inside
this thing
okay
so
here are the full instructions
this plastic is pretty thin too yeah can
we say off-gassing people okay so
there's that and there's a little vent
for the steam and here we go so there's
a suit base
oh look at this
this looks like
bamboo shoots
and oh awesome a pair of disposable
chopsticks love it already
look at this pack
this looks like it might be
woodier mushroom
okay i'm gonna try google translate
so it's not doing that so let's take a
picture of it look i can't find it it's
like i can't see i can't sing
oh hot pot side dishes cloth festival so
hot pot side dishes it can read
because that is in a very clear typeface
it can translate that but when it's in a
little bit of a script
it cannot recognize it like this do this
spicy taste ooh fire pot material okay
so this is going to be hot
let's take a picture
looking for chinese texts so the picture
function isn't working as well
okay we're going to see if it can
translate that one
bamboo shoots yes that is bamboo shoots
great
this one looks like it's going to be
some kind of
fake meat crisp cognac awesome so cognac
is a type of vegetable and they use it
to make konyaku jellies it's used a lot
in japanese food as well it's very low
in calorie i believe it's like kind of a
swamp plant
but it's used as kind of a filler it
doesn't have much of a taste but
sometimes it does have a kind of strong
smell this one is lovely this is lotus
root look at that isn't that gorgeous i
used to love eating that as a kid has a
great crunchy texture
side dish but oh it doesn't it's hard to
read because it's kind of wrinkled this
last one oh maybe this is bean curd some
kind of tofu let's see
yes crisp beans according tofu crisps
tofu great so we have our sauce and we
have a five additions
the lotus root the crisp cognac
the i think wood ear mushroom
the bamboo shoots and
tofu that looks like it's been marinated
and cooked so this is absolutely vegan
and vegetarian
okay
here's the cooking tray
oh and here down below we have a couple
more items oh boy
this is dried bean curd nice
and this
looks like it might be noodles looking
for chinese no chinese text found i
don't see any water though
so it doesn't say how much water to add
to this
let's see if we can translate the
directions
rip package place and add mineral adjust
to not to heating package can be so i
guess you just cover the heating package
it doesn't say specifically that you
need an x amount of water okay first
we're going to add our noodles
at the bottom
oh those are great look at that
they're so rubbery tofu these are almost
like little pieces of dry tofu skin
there is the soup base
these i believe are the woodier
mushrooms
yeah that's what they look like
whoa flying bean curd
there's the bean curd and here is the
konyaku
this is a lot of food look at all this
here are the bean bamboo shoots finally
we have our lotus root
beautiful
finally we're going to add 210
milliliters of water to the top tray
we're going to add the heating pack
the heating pack
so
we'll do an exothermic reaction here
place this on top
and place this on top and cover it
tightly
okay i already hear some
bubbling and sizzling that's great so it
gives you about 10 or 15 seconds to get
the lid on
i can really hear it now can you hear it
look at that
[Applause]
yes
it's instant it's an instant hot pot
all right be back in 11 minutes
okay so there's my alarm now i have to
say this thing gets wicked wicked wicked
hot don't move it don't touch it don't
do anything because you
are likely to burn yourself
it looks amazing
have you ever had black bean chili sauce
that's exactly what this smells like
chili black beans fermented black beans
have this really great almost smoky
earthy smell to them and flavor they're
delicious they're very salty as well
used in a lot of chinese cookery all
right so let's mix everything together
this
looks
hot look at this oily
chili you can see chunks of chili in
there oh my goodness here is the wood
ear mushroom love that here's the lotus
root
now there's not a lot of room here to
maneuver so i'm going to try to
slowly stir this up to make sure the
soup base is mixed in
with everything else i should also have
some extra water i think okay now i'm
very curious about the noodles to see
how well they're cooked look at the
noodles these look great
oh boy okay i'm very excited about this
so i'm gonna try to transfer this to a
bowl so i can stir it around better and
so you can see things better okay there
we go wow
and once you put in a bowl you can see
how large of a serving it is all right
let's have a noodle first
itadakimasu
mmm
can you hear that it's almost got like a
squeaky bouncy texture to them but
delightful it's a little bit like
fat rice noodles but a little bit
thicker and bouncier and chewy delicious
the sauce itself is very spicy and oily
and full of black bean flavor
delicious all right now i'm going to try
some bean curd
to me this is almost more like a stew
rather than having just like a bowl of
like noodles
can you hear that that's a lotus root it
has a very crunchy texture to it and
it's so beautiful with those holes
crunchy and starchy
this is very spicy though if you're not
into spicy foods i don't suggest trying
this
very spicy
the chili oil kind of coats the back of
your throat so it initiates that
coughing reflex but i love these noodles
so delightfully chewy chewy and a little
bit slippery
delightful
let's try a little bit of whittier
mushroom
those two also have a nice crunch to
them a little bit more jellied
a little bit more cartilaginous kind of
like some seaweeds that you might have
like a really like kelp has a nice kind
of almost vegetal jelly cartilaginous
crunch love that
what else haven't dried oh i haven't
tried a piece of bean curd yet
has a very chewy almost meat-like
texture to it in terms of consistency
it's almost like a hot dog
it's very homogeneous but bouncy and
meat-like but the flavor is more
five-spice
i've never had this kind of form of
cognac it almost looks like tripe but
it's not
again really great texture
kind of cartilaginous a bit like the
woodier mushroom but it just absorbs all
that sauce it doesn't have much of a
flavor of its own i think of all items
in here i think the noodles are my
favorite
just so delightfully chewy and slippery
delicious this is a bamboo shoot
that actually has some bamboo shoot
flavor to it which is pretty subtle but
you can taste a little bit in there this
is a lot a lot of food there's no way
that i would ever be able to finish this
is a huge portion but if you are a big
eater and if it's really cold outside i
think this would be fantastic of course
you must like spicy foods otherwise i
cannot recommend this but absolutely
