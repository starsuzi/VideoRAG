today on gardenfork learn how to prepare
dandelion stay
[Music]
tuned hey everyone welcome to Garden
Fork today we're going to talk about
Urban foraging homesteading Urban
homesteading basically eating weeds out
of your lawn uh we're going to pick and
make dandelion salad
today M dandelion grow out their
ubiquitous in the United States
uh we've got them in our garden here
we've got them in the yard and you can
eat them they're really healthy they
have some really good vitamins in them
they taste great especially in a salad
we're going to make where's the urban
part uh well if you're in a city and you
go to a park um and it's an area that
hasn't been sprayed or hasn't um been
trampled on been trampled on you can
pick the dandelion and uh eat them make
sure that it's an area that you're
allowed to do that in that's kind of
become kind of an issue I think lately
about people foraging and parks and
things but you know in your own yard or
in your garden like right here we have
dandelion look at that yeah so instead
of digging these up or spraying them and
getting rid of them you can
just pull them
up here's the tap rout we're not going
to eat the tap rout but you can pull up
your dandelion
plant break off the tap rout shake that
out collect it collect it and make a
salad and you've weeded your garden at
the same time there you go it's what you
know we don't we don't spray our yard
I'm not real big on that um I mean a
weed is just a plant that's in a place
where you don't want it uh these yards
that are like Immaculate that's that's
just not just not me and you want it in
your salad it's free food and it's in
your yard you don't have to drive
anywhere it has a real low carbon
footprint so eat it all right let's go
in kitchen I'll show you to make a
really cool salad all right let's
go getting better at
that all right in the kitchen it smells
like bacon in here uh We've collected
our dandelion greens run them through
your salad spinner one of these guys
cleans things up
nicely and then it's brilliantly simple
you see you have your greens
here we have some bacon this should kind
of be cut up though I have to cut the
bacon
up it's kind of
hot a poached egg 3 minutes poached egg
and you can watch your other video about
how to poach an
egg oh I broke the egg okay don't look
at that
part bacon
grease balsamic
vinegar oh that looks pretty
good I had some avocado throw that on
there
I guess the real Chef would kind of make
this look fancy but is that you no no I
eat weeds out of the yard you
know what I really like about poached
egg is you you poach the egg you punch
poke the egg in the salad and the yolk
is part of the sauce so you've got a
little bit of the Bacon Fat you got
balsamic it this looks really good
and I put this together in about 4
minutes literally I cooked a bacon
poached an egg went out and got salad
greens for basically pulled weeds out of
the yard and I made this amazing salad
is it bitter mm- it's
amazing that's really
good I'm also going to show you how to
slice of an avocado in another show but
um yum you know eggs are good for you
bacon in moderation is good for you you
could put less bacon in
here um you could even if you just have
a little bit of bacon fat in your fridge
you don't need to have the cooked bacon
but yum
salad
