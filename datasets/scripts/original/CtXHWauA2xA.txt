How to Run with a Dog.
Dogs love manic running as much as they love
chasing cats or rolling in dirt.
But before you go on a jog, there are a few
things to keep in mind.
You will need A three-to-five ft. leash A
plastic shopping bag for poop Running shoes
for you Comfortable athletic clothing Doggie
treats A full water bottle A fanny pack Portable
doggie dish and an old towel.
Step 1.
Keep an old towel handy to dry off your dog
after runs through rain or snow.
It’ll help him stay warm and keep your house
clean.
Did you know Ultramarathon champ Scott Jurek
used to run up to 30 miles a day with his
husky, Tonto—the only training partner who
could keep up with him.
Step 2.
Have your dog checked over by the vet to make
sure he doesn’t have any physical issues
that would stop him from regular running.
Step 3.
Dress for your run, grab an empty plastic
bag, fill up your water bottle and load up
a pocket with dog biscuits.
Avoid running with your dog right before or
after you feed him.
Give his stomach at least an hour to normalize.
Step 4.
If you’re running in the woods or through
fields, check your dog and yourself for ticks.
Step 5.
Hold your dog on a short leash so he concentrates
on you and your pace.
Too long a leash and he’ll fixate on squirrels,
passing cars, clouds and whatever else it
is that distracts dogs.
Step 6.
For the first few times, run on dirt, sand,
or grass until his paws toughen up and his
joints adapt to the pounding of running.
Run for 20 minutes every other day.
Each week add five minutes to the run time.
Step 7.
Avoid forcing the pace with your dog.
If you do, they’ll hate running.
It will take a few runs for your dog to develop
the fitness and stamina to keep up with you.
If you’re thirsty, it’s highly likely
that your dog is as well.
Map a route that allows for water breaks for
both of you every 20 minutes or so.
Step 8.
Consider the weather and its effects on your
dog.
Hot asphalt and salted frozen concrete can
hurt paws.
Short-haired dogs may need doggie coats or
sweaters 
to help them stay warm in sub-freezing temps.
