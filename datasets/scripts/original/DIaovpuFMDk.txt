okay how to change the brakes
the rear brakes brake lines
we're going to be using a foot long
brake line with the flared ends and then
the bendable brake load brake hose and
then on the other end
there's a new brake hose on there so i'm
just going to use a
brake line on there that goes to the
wheel cylinder
there's the bending
tool uh i'll need that mallet
pb blaster
uh i break fluid
various tools to get the brake lines off
for some uh
pliers and goggles and
i need to
jack the car up and then they're you
know the flashlights them in the garage
it's nice and cool in here it's hot but
you need tools for everything
even to get this stupid
protecting thing off you need a tool
it's crazy you need a tool for
everything
all right your gloves on and your
four-way this is 19 millimeter get the
uh
the uh
okay before i forget block block the
tires
and set
the parking brake a little
setup all right
so back here
there one two bends
three that
and then the brake hose
and then that's the culprit
and then it goes
okay 13 millimeter on the bottom and let
y
you twist 11 16 right here you twist
that off
take that off and relieve the pressure
hold this
with a pliers
while you turn that
little clip there it needs to be pulled
out
so this will be twisting off you'll be
twisting this
off of that so earlier i said twist that
you need to pull that pin
you pull one of these pins or whatever
the clip pull it out and then you pull
it up
and then this
part you can twist the whole thing twist
off of that
but there's brake fluid getting
everywhere
now take off that
make it easier put it on there
and then
hit it with a mallet okay i took again a
gander at this part and it don't look
too bad this brick line i mean there was
one little spot that's a little rustier
than i'd like
but just paint over it spray paint
and it all looks pretty good
so i'm just going to put it back on dry
it up clean it up
use the wire brush on the on the threads
and just put it back on
so that end will go there and then
this end will go
in there
now this you'll have to pick it up
straight up straight up and twist it on
okay so pretty much there's a clip
right there
and you push that in
and then on the other end there's a clip
that one's really hard it's sideways
there's a clip
and it goes in there you get to push
that down and that up at the same time
while you
pretty much hammer that in
that clip
and uh yep i should do it
brake hose repair
i said oh it looks like you can do the
job yourself now
so go do it yeah yeah yeah
