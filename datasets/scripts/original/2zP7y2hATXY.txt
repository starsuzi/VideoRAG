okay here's the my sale rig for the
canoe 16t canoe fiberglass canoe that I
built you've got a
uh see the lebard
here and I have a
quick release so I can pull it up I need
to
I used electrical conduit for the
Mast an inch and a quar I
believe homemade sale out of sale
material made my
uh homemade
little things that go on the Mast with
uh
PVC uh actually it's electrical
conduit
um Rudder system is pretty neat
it actually these lines
here you pull on one it Returns the
center because of the bungee
cords pretty in interesting little setup
it is a kick up Rudder when you get
close to shore you just pull this
lock you can pull the rudder up so it
doesn't damage
it
Etc looking at the
Outriggers I just took off this 2x4 off
of the uh the top Mass partner if that's
what you call
it and uh actually used some old
crutches from
a from a thrift
store I made these Outriggers from pool
noodles and PVC with a 45 on the
end
um the mass step you can see
it there's a piece of 2x6 treated
lumber kind of shaped out to the bottom
of the canoe and uh it's epoxy to the
bottom this main Mass partner here is
actually bolted to the seat which is
bolted to the
gunnels and then this top Mass partner
is actually if you can
see there's an eyebolt that comes down
there's a bolt sticking this it's coming
through the
gunnels and gives it a lot of
extra stability
there
so that's that and I have made this me
metal
thwart uh ready for another lebard if I
need one I haven't tried this yet so I'm
going to have to see if I actually need
one before I build
it and then these canoe stand hands are
really easy to build you just build them
out of 2x4s and put a strip of carpet in
between not very
hard so
anyway that's that's my uh canoe
sail with Outriggers and
lebard I don't know if that's overboard
having the the Outriggers but at least I
have stability if I want to take the
sail down and go fishing uh I have
a a cable shroud on the
front with a turnbuckle at the
bottom that uh connects it
so yeah looking forward to its maiden
voyage I have no idea of when that will
be but it should be soon because it's
warming
up
