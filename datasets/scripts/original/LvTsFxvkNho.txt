welcome to howto videos from
bugspray.com
today I'm going to show you how to set
up a snake art snake trap and
demonstrate how the snake trap Works a
couple of things to keep in mind while
you're setting your snake trap one is
you want to have it along a wall because
typically snakes are going to be
traveling along a wall and the second
thing is to have maybe a roll of tape on
hand duct tape or masking tape should
work fine you just want it to be held in
place so that uh as the snake's
traveling into it it doesn't get pushed
around it's a pretty good size trap but
at the same time a really good siiz
snake might push it out of the way
so I'm going to go ahead and set it up
now first thing you want to do is
just there's a little piece of uh paper
here that holds it together inside of it
there's
some instructions we'll set those to the
side since I've done this before there's
a uh everything has folds in it so it's
very easy to follow and there's some
little dimples on here you want to make
sure you hit
those this just gives the snake some
areas have some traction and you also
notice that there's some uh some grip on
the bottom of this as well next thing
you want to do is remove the wax paper
from the
glue another feature of this trap is
that the
glue is in a
vshape so as a snake's traveling in it's
not going to actually hit the glue till
it's Midway into the Trap so even if
you're catching a large snake uh it
works really well next thing you're
going to do is fold
this
and slip it into the
notches again everything's
precut very easy assembly as you can see
[Music]
says very clear on it place this side
against the
wall and
again I'm going to use a little bit of
masking tape to hold it in
[Applause]
[Music]
place it's going to have a tendency to
want to pull because the way was folded
for
all that time
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and it may even be helpful to put a
couple extra
pieces above it depending on how your
wall is made this particular wall
happens to have concrete
which masking tape doesn't want to hold
on to real tightly
so that should give me just enough to
hold everything in
[Music]
place and that's really all there is to
setting up the snake trap next we're
going to uh basically just monitor it if
we see a snake coming we'll try to get
the camera on in time to uh Catch It On
video okay as you can see here comes the
snake and now that I see it I can see
it's a rat snake and I can probably just
go over and pick it up but really for
the purposes of this demonstration I
wanted to show how the snake art snake
trap works now one thing you'll notice
uh I put a little extra tape on this
ledge uh I know that snakes like to not
only go along edges but they like to go
along on top of an edge as this rat
snake
is showing right now so hopefully the
tape that I built up there to kind of
guide it back down into the Trap is
sufficient for uh getting it to go where
I want it to go the great thing about
the snake trap is that uh it is a dark
place and snakes like to feel protected
so they'll go into a dark place like
this another thing about it is once that
snake gets stuck on the glue it's going
to try harder and harder to get off of
the glue and as it struggles to get off
it's going to get more and more stuck to
it the great thing about about the snake
art snake trap is I'm actually going to
be able to take just a little bit of
cooking oil or olive oil and once this
demonstration is done I'll be able to
release the snake without any harm to it
whatsoever okay you can see it's moving
a little bit now he's working himself
trying to get off the glue I he's
apparently stuck on
now as you can see the snake's
definitely
stuck and is currently trying to work
his way out okay from this shot you can
see the snake is uh currently stuck on
here a little bit and it's
currently trying to work his way
[Music]
off and we'll just watch and
uh see how successful he is we'll just
leave this on and see how long it takes
for him to get good and stuck on there
more he struggles the more he pushes
himself against that glue the more
firmly he'll be caught
[Applause]
okay you can see he's still struggling a
little bit the more he struggles the
more stuck he gets okay here's a shot of
the snake from the other side of the box
and you can see as you look down the
glue that uh that snake is fairly well
caught in
there and I am pretty certain that there
is no way that snake is going to be able
to get off that
glue okay at this point the snake's been
on the board for about 5 minutes and I'm
pretty certain his entire body is inside
this box so I'm pretty certain he's
fairly well caught on it I'm going to go
ahead and open it up and see if we can
uh get a good view of the
inside okay there you go you can see
there's no way this snake's getting off
of this glue
board I'm going to
to the
[Music]
wall going pull it up here just so you
can
see it's a beautiful rat snake and I'm
glad I was able to trap him with the
glue uh for it be very easy to release
and then I'll show you that in okay I've
got the snake over here in a shady area
of my yard um I personally don't mind
having a rat snake around they eat a lot
of mice uh but at the same time I
wouldn't want him in my garage either so
uh I'm going to go ahead and release him
I can tell this one's about to
Mt
so ahead and just pour the oil on here
we're using canola oil cuz it's healthy
healthy
snake this size as strong as it is it
should only take a minute or two for
the you just got to make sure you get
this canola oil all over every Edge so
that the uh glue will start to
dissolve with the snake working its way
off it should only take a second or
two come off
[Music]
you already see down here look at this
it's already broken Lo good portion of
it again the snake's getting oil on
it see here you can always add a little
bit more you already see look at that
it's about uh 40 50% of the way off
slowly but surely pulling its head away
yeah that's not happy with me at all
[Music]
the snake Works its way off look at that
it's almost completely off now it's not
real accurate at the
moment look at that
[Music]
[Music]
all right he's completely released and
off he goes nice and healthy that's how
you trap and
release a snake with a snake guard snake
