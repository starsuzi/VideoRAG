hello I'm Matt with applian video.com uh
what we have here today is a mayag
topload
washer basically pretty much sto
midcycle it's completely full of water
uh when we try to pull the timer nothing
happens you know you got a regular this
would be the agitation we're not getting
anything there rotate it down to the
spin cycle pull it sitting totally
Dead uh basically the only thing way we
checked so far was just check the the
outlet made sure we had 120 at the
outlet which we do so what we're going
to do is we're going to just pull it out
here a little
bit
and we're going to unplug
it and we're going to remove the access
panel on the back here so we've
got three philli screws along the
top and there are two more looks like
516 screws on the back
panel they're a/4 inch on the back panel
so we got two4 in screws on the back
here that we're going to
remove all right now you have two screws
one on each Corner that are/ quarter
inch that hold the back side of the
panel
down they're kind of uh kind of in a
tight space so you might need a little
ratchet or a stubby
screwdriver and now I just grab on both
sides there
and you can kind of flip the control
panel up that'll get you some access to
your lid switch your timer and you got
your pressure switch in the back
here all right now we're just doing
through the contacts on the lid switch
here uh the contact that we show that is
good is from Blue to Yellow it's opening
and closing and sending the power but
there's the other contact in here which
goes to the timer
itself which is between black and blue
which we're not
getting continuity
through so we're suspecting at this
point that we've got a bad lid switch uh
so what we're going to do is go ahead
and put a new lid switch in and see
where we're at with it so what you're
going to want to do is just sort of push
forward on the lid switch with the lid
up and it just pops out of its position
there and just remove the
connector
reconnect your
[Music]
harness
okay okay uh so we put the new lid
switch in now uh what we're going to do
is just just test it out so make sure
you're not touching any wires or
anything plug it back in and we're just
going to go ahead
and turn it to like an agitation
setting pull the timer
out and it is
agitating when you open the lid it stops
STS so now we are going to check the
spin cuz there is multiple contacts on
this particular lid
switch uh not all lid switches will stop
agitation when the lid is
up it is spinning and
draining and it's stopping when we open
the
lid
[Music]
okay so now at this point we're just
going
to shut it off unplug it and put it all
back together all right so we're just
going to go ahead flip the panel back
over
here watch this air
tube just sort of seat it in place and
push it back and it'll lock in
all right we're going to go ahead and
put our screws in on the back panel
here don't really want to overtighten
them because just plastic so you can
crack that back panel really all they're
doing is just kind of holding it in
place you just don't want it to slide
forward or
backwards all right now we got our back
panel here
of set it right up on top like
that and you
got two4 inch
screws and you've got three Phillip
screws along the
[Music]
top okay now we're just going to push it
back into
place
okay once you get it back in place just
check your fill hoses make sure you
don't have any leaks make sure your
drain hose didn't come
detached everything looks good so we'll
go ahead drain the rest of this water
out
[Music]
here okay and that's going to complete
the repair on the topl load May tag
