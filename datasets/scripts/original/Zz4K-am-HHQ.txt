so it'll burn out a tree stump
fill some holes
one of these
it's a one inch size uh drill bit you
want to go at least 12 inches deep
and you want this hole
to go in at an angle connect with these
holes in the top
um
which stumps about 18 inches in diameter
I drilled one
two three
some side holes
and after you do this pile uh
charcoal on top
light that baby up and you'll get
something like this
has been burning for less than six hours
and you can see
right here is where the side holes were
going in
um
I
clear out these holes once in a while
you can see
the oxygen is being sucked in
through these holes
it's getting a real nice burn in there
so
I messed up on this side didn't get the
hole all the way through you can see the
difference
and uh
so that's it that's how you burn tree
stump out pretty effectively
