this is our 4bt project
if you're thinking of doing this project
there's a few things to consider
the manifold exhaust manifold on the 4bt
puts the turbo straight down
we want to put the bigger turbo on and
that doesn't give us any room for the
intake so what we're going to do is take
the exhaust manifold off of the 5.9
which has the turbo coming out on an
angle
rather than it going straight down and
that'll put the turbo a little bit off
to the side and will allow us to clear
the oil filter housing and we're going
to steal this
assembly for the thermostat we also
stole
the plate that goes on the intake and
we're going to put our preheater on
there as well so we're going to modify
the plate what happens is straight 12
volts goes in and these plates become
cherry red just like the
stove would the problem with glow plugs
is
individual glow plugs go in cylinders
and they get red hot but if your glow
plugging while you're cranking over your
engine the cold fuel hits the gold plugs
and burns them out this pre-heater will
never burn out
this
housing
is off of the 5.9 and it has the
mounting bolts for the ac compressor i
want to keep the ac so we're going to
adapt that to fit the gm ac compressor
we're also gonna do our dreaded um
stud that rattles out and mashes up all
of your teeth
um so we'll show you how to do that
little piece we're just gonna cut a
piece of steel just a circle with a
point sticking out to cover up the pin
and um i've seen other people put a bolt
through the outside or a self-tapping
screw but that looks kind of like a hack
job we're not going to do that one on
this one
this is our crankshaft as you can see
it's got a little groove in it that's
worn from the old seal the old seal was
flush with the top of the timing cover
if we put the seal back in the same spot
it'll ride on that groove and a leak we
want to do is push the seal a little
lower making sure it's perfectly even
and
making sure we do not pull this little
plastic ring out that ring is meant to
go on the crankshaft and that eliminates
any chance of cutting that seal when you
put it on
this is the 4bt just about dressed i got
the exhaust manifold of the 5.9 on there
i'm not exactly sure what the best spot
for the turbo is this manifold is nice
that the fact that you can put it upside
down
the bolts still line up and because it's
a six cylinder going on a four cylinder
i can move it uh an ear forward or near
back and that will um put the turbo in a
different spot wherever i like it best
but we'll leave that for when it's in
the in the tahoe i've got my cooler
lines off of the 5.9
i got to put my alternator on but it's
going to go right here but i have to
take the manifold off to do that i put
the ac compressor on yet
i also have the preheater on off the 5.9
so this is the plate off the 5.9 we just
cut the end off of both sides and then
welded the connection tight and then
machined it flat so that the gasket will
seal properly
we're going to
take our
fuel pump apart give it a little extra
fuel i also have the turbo off the 5.9
on there so just give her a little more
boost
nothing crazy
and then
there we'll go
and show you guys how to braise
this is my cast manifold off of the 5.9
which is going on the 4bt so i cut two
cylinders off i took a piece of the
casting cut it out of my cutoff piece
and stuck it in that way we've got the
same materials you can weld cast the
problem is it expands and contracts so
much that if you weld it cold it'll
crack you need special cast rod for it
and you'd have to heat up the entire
thing
so it's red hot and then weld it so
everything shrinks at the same time and
your welds don't crack another way to do
it is brazing there's not much pressure
here
so i prefer to braise you can buy your
brazing rod just at your hardware store
it comes with a nice coating on it
to protect it but
if you want to be cheap you can use a
coat hanger if you want
there you go whatever you do do not cool
it
with anything but
normal air and that's a nice
look another breeze
so this is what your 4bt should look
like as it's about to go into the truck
um close of a mock-up as you can saves
time later what we've done is put the
fire the 5.3 alternator on it we've kept
it as close to the engine as possible so
that we've got room for our intake pipe
to come off our turbo
put the turbo on a 5 3 exhaust manifold
and then braze the ends shut
you can actually put that manifold
however you want you can have it farther
back farther forward and then flip it
upside down too so essentially you can
have your turbo here here here here here
or here works out really really nice
whatever you want um
that's the beauty of the five nine and
the three nine
to make the turbo spool up faster we've
added some mexican chrome
we've uh shortened the exhaust so that
it drops down as quick as possible
hopefully doesn't get in the way of
the
ac otherwise we'll have to add another
bend but we can do that later we're
gonna tune up the pump and give it a
little more oomph with the uh android
valve the uh
fuel um
screw there and um
we put a new lift pump on so we're good
to go we're going to degrease it paint
it and
get ready to start putting it into the
tahoe
if you ever wondered what that extension
cord sticking out the front of your
vehicle is it's a block heater
what it is is a heating element that
goes into your antifreeze or cooling
system and warms it up for easier
starting
very helpful for diesels and almost
necessary in canada here it's minus 30
outside today
couldn't get my 5 9 going because the
heater was burnt out
what it they sit in these water jackets
sometimes mistaken as frost plugs they
are not frost plugs
some people believe that if your
antifreeze uh is not strong enough to
deal with the cold temperatures and
freezes these will pop out and prevent
your block from freezing that is not the
case all they are are water jacket plugs
so we'll show you how to install one of
those today
a little bit of vaseline
put it on your o-ring
no chance of cutting the
o-ring when you're putting it on or it
reduces the risk
this is our 4bt and you can see the
cylinders through our oil cooler hole it
has a little film on it this should have
had antifreeze changed earlier we
wouldn't get this film if you have a
coolant filter you do want to see a
little film here and what that is is
generally you have a wet sleeve engine
what that means is you can pull your
cylinders out and replace your cylinders
when you're rebuilding your engine and
you get a brand new engine this would
have to be machined
uh if i wanted to do a rebuild you can
see that's a it's a one piece so it's
called a dry sleeve meaning you cannot
pull these cylinders out um your coolant
filter doesn't filter your coolant what
it does is it puts a little film on the
cylinders um as your piston is coming
down on its uh power stroke it's
actually vibrating coming down in
minuscule little forms um what it's
doing is pushing your coolant away from
the cylinders and creates an implosion
that if that film wasn't there it would
eat out the steel with the film on there
it um
eats out that film and keeps your
cylinders in good shape it's called
cavitation i know the john deeres were
bad for it way back when
the coolant filters seemed to take care
of that change your filter every time
you change your oil
they're cheap enough and unless your
manufacturer says
to do it at a certain recommended time
shouldn't be a problem to change it
every time you do an oil change
our oil cooler consists of the oil
filter housing with valleys at the back
where the oil transfers through these
holes into the cooler that sits in the
water now the the point of this is to
moderate the oil
temperature of the engine keep it steady
as pieces are expanding and contracting
with the heat you want as little of that
as possible because different materials
expand and contract at a different rate
it's less wear on the engine if
everything is very consistent now your
oil pressure runs up to about 70 psi 20
at an idle whereas your
coolant pressure runs up to about 14 psi
so while you're running if you've got a
leak in your cooler the oil pressure is
putting oil into your antifreeze when
you shut your truck off
the oil pressure stops now the system is
still under pressure you can get water
in your oil
so
if you
do an oil change you see water in there
you don't it might not be a head gasket
necessarily it could be an oil cooler
this is also very common if you've had
freezing because there's very thin
layers of uh
gaps in between here the water freezes
in there and wrecks these coolers so
pull your cooler before you diagnose the
uh the head gasket
installing a fan belt with an idler is
really easy if you know what you're
doing i know i've before i knew anybody
i'm trying to push on this and get my
fan belt around every single idler has a
square socket in it for either a half
inch or a 3 8
ratchet and all you have to do is lean
on it
put your belt on
make sure all your ribs are lined up
properly
and you're done
so follow a variety of projects that
include conversions and repairs to
anything from ferraris to chainsaws and
