thank you
hey guys real nice Guyana here again
with another realized recipe
today we're gonna be making fried okra
or okra and these are the following
ingredients we're going to be needing
for this recipe
first of all we have the okroas there
it's two packs like this here
they are each about half a pound
so it's going to be about one pound
double Cruz
and we're gonna be using
about five steps of shallow half an
onion one tomato
one very very pepper optional
we're going to be adding some shrimp to
this as well
but of course you can leave the shrimp
out and this will be a very nice
vegetarian recipe
we also going to be using four cloves of
the garlic and salt it is
so I know a lot of people don't like Oak
Rose because it's too slimy but there's
just a few steps you can take to
minimize the sliminess and we're gonna
show you what those are okay guys
so let's begin
for the first step we're gonna watch the
overalls
and then you're gonna dry that off
before we cut it up
so to minimize the sliminess of this
okra guys after washing it we're now
gonna dry it out
like that
you want to take away as much water as
possible
and you can individually wipe them off
like that with a paper towel
or if you have a cloth
after drying these off now you're gonna
cut them up like this here
so these here are completely dry now
so we're gonna be mincing the garlic and
the pepper in this mortar here
foreign
to this dried pan here
so we're gonna burn out the water from
the front here
this is for our shrimp
as I said you can make this
a very nice vegetarian dish
without the shrimp
so this is just for about half a minute
or so to burn out the water from that
and then we're gonna put it aside so
after the occurs later okay
so we have about two to three
tablespoons of oil in the span here
which will heat in
and okra needs a bit more oil and other
vegetables so we're gonna add our
seasoning there now
as a salad
on the tomato
we also gonna add the minced garlic and
pepper here
this smells so delicious guys
bringing out all the flavors from the
Tomato the onions
the shallows
good
okay guys so after about a minute or so
once this all the seasonings have
released all these flavors we're gonna
add the okra in there now
[Music]
we're gonna mix that all in
foreign
It Off
now the Second Step would be to cook
this uncovered because if you cook a
cover
that's gonna produce steam which is
going to drop into the okra there
and positively sorry
and the other thing that you do
to minimize the sliminess is the salt
when you add salt to any vegetable it
brings out a lot of juices from the
vegetable which is going to cause it to
be more slimy so we're gonna add the
salt towards the end of this dish you
don't want to add it
cool it
because it's just gonna overpower the
dish
but as close to the end as possible
don't add it now or too early
because that's going to add to the
sliminess okay guys
so we're just gonna leave this here now
and let it cook
I will see you
we also going to add the shrimp here now
and in Guyanese cooking we usually add
the shrimp early because the shrimp
usually
flavors the main ingredient which is
okra here now
the shrimp is usually overcooked and by
these dishes okay
so now we're gonna let it cook guys
okay guys so another yet another step to
reduce the sliminess in this okra is
that you can add some vinegar here
this is about five minutes since we
started
so we're gonna add some vinegar here
just a tablespoon
you can also add some lime juice or
lemon juice to this as well which will
help to cut the slime in this also
foreign
you also want to spread out your okroas
in the pan as thinly as possible
that also helps it helps to reduce the
sliminess okay guys
it's been 20 minutes since we started
cooking this here
and we've added a little vinegar as you
can see there's not much sliminess in
the tofu look at that
so those are the steps you can take to
reduce the shininess
and your o4 is going to come out perfect
so we're now going to add the salt here
because it's almost done
and today we're adding about
one tablespoon
so some like their okroas like this here
as it is here this color
what are we gonna cook this for a little
bit more we're getting a little bit more
Brown
and then it'll be done already guys
so I'm gonna take a test here guys
mmm yummy
nice very good I love all fruits and
this here is perfect
not too slimy
and the salt is okay here
okay guys so this is about ready
okay guys so this okra fried okra is
done and ready
and here it is as you can see it's still
piping hot
and it is not as slimy
very nice
and as I said this is a very nice
vegetarian Dish as well
without a shrimp of course
