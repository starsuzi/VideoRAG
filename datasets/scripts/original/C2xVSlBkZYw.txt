hello friends how are you all welcome to our channel
Today I bring you a rich recipe for the heat that has been in these days
today we are going to make a delicious classic and ancestral drink
We are going to make a rich tepache, they accompany me to know the ingredients
tepache
Delicious traditional Mexican prehispanic drink
ingredients
for your tepache you will need:
- 1 medium to large pineapple washed and disinfected
- 1 cone and a half of brown sugar
- 1 slice of cinnamon
The first step for our tepache is to perfectly wash the pineapple
I already have my pineapple washed here and we are going to remove the skin
I already have my pineapple peels, I put them in this container they will serve us for the tepache
This part is going to be stored in the refrigerator to make a delicious fat-burning smoothie that later on we will have in the canal
and the rest I put in my blender to prepare a rich pineapple water
as you see the pineapple we can take several uses and make the most of this fruit
the next step is to place the peels in a bucket and put water
once they put their peels they put water approximately three quarters of the bucket and cover it perfectly
and we are going to leave it for about 4 to 5 days covered and if we move so that it ferments
Leave to ferment at room temperature 4 to 5 days
It has been a week since we left fermenting our pineapple peel in the water and we already see foam in the water
and now we are going to dilute a cone of piloncillo in warm water
in this step you can add the cinnamon to the piloncillo according to your taste and choice
 I already have my cone of piloncillo in the water
so that it goes heating and diluting
while our piloncillo is diluted in the warm water, we are going to strain what is fermented with the pineapple peels
Normally we use blanket fabric from heaven, but as I do not have it now, we are going to use a napkin
I'm all strained and the only thing we're going to use is the caldito
Now our piloncillo completely diluted in the hot water, now they will put it in a clay pot
and we are going to stir it with the liquid that we strain from the pineapple peels
we move perfectly
and is acquiring the characteristic color of tepache
and the aroma
the only thing missing is to put enough ice and leave it for 2 to 3 hours in the clay pot to concentrate its flavor
and with this would be everything
I'm ready our tepache looks great
