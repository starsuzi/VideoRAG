welcome to Common Man cocktails I'm your
host Eric show today we're going to
create the Vanilla Coke reloaded I'm
using Coke Zero for this you can use
regular Coke just don't use Vanilla Coke
don't use Cherry Coke use regular of
some type diet uh get something that
kind of whatever get your favorite coke
uh we're going to do some crazy
ingredients here we've got both Fireball
whiskey again this is kind of what where
what inspired this was the fact that we
got the Fireball whiskey fans have been
watching it fans who either like
Fireball whiskey or or went out to find
Fireball Whiskey recipes to send me
because either they want their on the
show which by the way this was submitted
by Mike or because they've tried it
they've been inspired by the Fireball
whiskey whatever Fireball whiskey
vanilla vodka that's the vanilla part
Vanilla Coke reloaded is the recipe name
so Spiced Rum I have lots of Spiced Rum
I could have chosen
Kine uh the
Lash uh Private Stock one of my favorite
regular cath Morgan if you're into that
I went with Kraken haven't used it in a
while it's got a cool bottle and people
said How's Kraken it's good prove it
right now done so I'm going to build
this in the glass itself high ball glass
whatever you have and that's kind of it
we're going to
do some ice we're going to do a half
ounz of the Fireball whiskey a half ounz
of spice rum one full ounce of vanilla
it's got the vanilla in the name
right I I think this might be Overkill I
would not go and pick a spice rum that
has a high influence of cinnamon in it
because and it can it's spiced I don't
think this one does let's
see cuz you've already added
cinnamon smells pretty good to
me but not not too over
cified so there's your half
ounces we'll do a full oun and we're
going to do 6 oz of the
cola I guess you could technically use
Pepsi if you like Pepsi for some reason
but kind of defeats the purpose I think
it would be Vanilla Pepsi
reloaded that would be a different
drink to you probably just top it but
I'm going to be all specific see how
much I can actually fit in this
glass I don't think I'm going to fit
[Music]
six huh
H that's a little less so you probably
just top it got about six
[Music]
there Stir It Up a little
bit oh you can totally see the alcohol
sitting on the bottom
tooy it's coming in now make a nice
foam
[Music]
there you go looks like I don't know
Ramen coke
coke
coke smells like like a a cinnamon spicy
Coke I wouldn't from the smell I
wouldn't think
vanilla whoa but from the initial taste
just while sipping it I get the
vanilla and in the finish I get the
vanilla but all in between is this is a
spicy a little bit of alcohol just a
little bit of rum flavor to it a
spicy hot cinnamon finished with vanilla
so vanilla spicy hot cinnamon vanilla
and there's probably Coke in there too
right that the whole body is that
carbonated Coke but you get all those
flavors almost in like a roll of flavors
not all kind of at once not in this
weird jumbled pattern of disgustingness
they kind of all fit together it doesn't
have as much vanilla as I would have
thought it definitely has a little bit
of vanilla Vanilla Coke I think has more
and some people don't I don't think like
that this is more subtle than that
however it's got the Fireball whiskey so
it's got a little bit of heat to it just
a just a little bit of like that
cinnamon I think
realistically depending on the spice
drum you use you might not need the
Fireball whiskey because spice rum kind
of has some of that going with it so it
might be Overkill
but again if you're looking for an
excuse to use Fireball whiskey this is
an excuse excuses are good to have
that's the Vanilla Coke reloaded thank
you
Mike plus I'm a big fan of Coke Zero so
it's pretty tasty little drink everyday
