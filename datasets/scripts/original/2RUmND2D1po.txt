hello everybody and welcome to my
channel in this video I'm going to be
showing you how to make a marble cake
okay the recipe is going to be in the
description box so for the recipe you're
going to need some eggs canola oil sugar
yogurt vanilla extract and a vanola bean
which is optional some cocoa powder
allpurpose flour mixed with some baking
powder and some salt let's start okay so
the first step I'm going to do is
basically whisk the sugar with the eggs
okay now after whisking the sugar with
the eggs you want to add in your
extract and whisk that all
together along with your vanilla bean if
you are adding
this okay I just added my vanilla bean
I'm going to whisky it now
along to this I'm going to add the
canola
oil and the
yogurt and whisk that
all okay guys so here after mixing for
about 2 minutes all of your Li with
ingredients but using a handheld whisk
you can use the hand mixer there's no
need for a for you know a standing mixer
now we're just going to add in our
allpurpose flour our salt and the baking
powder all mixed together which are our
dry ingredients in
this bowl just add it all together and
whisk it gently you don't want to go too
crazy whisking because we don't want
gluten to form we want this to be nice
and
fluffy like this till the lumps are gone
not any further than
this so like here I'm almost done just
one final
whisk just like this and we're done by
the
Whisk now I'm just going to take my
satat and scrape down the sides just
like that here's our vanilla batter now
we want to divide this batter in half so
we can make the marble cake which is the
chocolate part here and the vanilla part
here so just take my bowl and divide
this in
half approximately you shouldn't be like
very exactly this you don't have
to okay and to this here the vanilla you
want to add in the cocoa
powder and
whisk
guys so after we whisk the cocoa powder
we've got our chocolate batter and our
vanilla batter here so what we're going
to do at first is add in like half of
the amount of the vanilla batter into
the
bottom and have the amount of chocolate
on top of
that
and
