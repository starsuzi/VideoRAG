hi we're going to make blackened fish
today you can do it with about any kind
of fish um we're using tilapia um you
can buy this commercially it's sealed
vacuum
sealed uh you can do it with fishy catch
like catfish you can it'll work with
about anything if you go down south they
do it with red fish here couple things
that we're going to do is we're going to
start with what we're going to blacken
the fish with and there's three people
in my family and we all have different
Taste of how hot we like it here's me
and I like it the hottest
so you really just can kind of figure
out what you like you start off with
garlic powder to begin
with
just it's a pretty good base on
it and then the other thing that you
want to do this is just a dried
mustard little dried mustard that's you
know maybe two
tablespoons maybe a little
more it's not a precise science as you
can
see salt I use sea salt I just kind of
like the consistency of
it white pepper a little hotter than
black pepper if you don't have white
pepper you certainly can use black
pepper and this is just a creole
seasoning you can get you can get those
about anywhere at the store um it adds a
little of the heat to it okay here's the
cayenne pepper this is the red stuff
that makes it pretty darn hot so if you
don't like it hot don't put this in did
you see how that kind of chunked in
pretty good there so we probably put
about three tablespoons in
so what we're going to do is we'll just
shake this up okay there's my hot mix
okay my son who's the film crew right
now likes it kind of medium hot so we
used What's called the slap your mama
and it's a it's a pretty good cuning
seasoning and this one is by Cajun
seasonings in Villa plot Louisiana so
we're just going C we're just going to
put his straight with that now my lovely
wife doesn't like it quite as hot as
either one of us so to do hers i' I had
some extra barbecue rub one time and I
went ahead and put it in here and she
really liked it once again Mustard's
kind of the base for the barbecue
rub
okay we want no Cayenne in this one
little garlic
powder once again this isn't a precise
science whatever your taste is little
sea
salt okay you can put it just a touch of
white pepper in white pepper is really
not that really not that spicy you put
you put too much in she'll know it
though okay the other thing that I put
in my barbecue rub is I put in sugar
so I'll put in a little sugar in this
one so probably another two teaspoons of
sugar right there so we got
that shake it
up and there you go you got your three
rubs you got your hot you're medium and
you're not so hot and uh sometimes if I
do this with with uh when I'm having
company over um I'll ask them how they
like it and most people will probably
lean towards these two cuz this is kind
of flamethrower on it the other thing
that you're going to need before you get
started is butter and a
Croc so basically all all we got is a is
a little Croc and we're going to melt
two tablespoons of butter in it just
going to melt it in the microwave and uh
what we're going to do is once we take
these out we'll cut it and we drizzle
we'll drizzle it over it and then we'll
spice it but I'll show you that on the
next
step hi now we're back outside here one
of the reasons we do it outside is it
creates a lot of smoke as you're going
to see here one thing that I got is I
got a nice cast iron skillet that works
really good for blackening blackening
fish I use this for blacking I use this
for frying the other thing I'm doing
this on is a turkey fryer and uh just a
propane cooker it really gives you high
heat quickly that's why I'm doing it
there if you look around you can see
we've had about 20 in of snow within the
last week or so starting to get a little
dirty looking but uh you can blacken
fish in pretty much any
weather my propane cooker went out
that's the only thing you got to be
careful about okay so you go ahead and
put your Skillet
on I camera man got scared so we backed
off all
right all right I'm going to show you
what you do
first is what you want to do is you want
to put the least spiciest in first that
way it won't get spiced from the other
ones on it so I got my tilapia just in a
dish
here got my melted
butter so take take your melted butter
drizzle it on just a little bit like
that
if it's cold sometimes it'll almost get
straight to
it right now it's 41Â° out
here okay this is my wife's so you
remember you remember how I said she
doesn't like it as spicy so we're just
going to take our seasonings here and
just kind
of put it on one
side
okay
good substantial
spatula I'm going to go ahead and just
drop it in the
skillet see how it's smoking that's what
it's supposed to
do
good we're going to take that take a
little more of the
butter be careful cuz that scale is hot
that's
that's the secret you really want that
to be hot so do that and what really
blackens it's not really the fish it's
the seasoning that blackens so just kind
of spread it over
evenly this tilapia works really good
cuz it's not real thick the thicker the
fish the longer you have to do it see
how it's starting to get white right
there along the edge that means it's
about ready to
turn we're going to look for little wide
along this
Edge once again you can do this in your
kitchen but you need a good exhaust man
okay we're going to slip it
over push it to stick to the
skillet turn it down just to
touch it's really important not to have
grease in a skillet when you're cooking
it you're just doing it straight to the
skillet that's what's causing it to
cook so you know it probably total cook
times two to 3 minutes on
this with a thin fish like this it's
really kind of it's really kind of hard
to
undercook we'll give it just
ghost more okay one thing you want to do
when you get this fish out you want to
get the next fish in cuz with that
propane roaring away underneath
there it will keep that Skillet up fast
okay so there's fish number one out fish
number two getting ready to go
in
and got a little butter on it we're just
going to put the Cajun seasoning
on now going to drop fish number two
in that's the butter burning off right
there we C it down just a
little
see how it really
smokes as you can guess I'm not really
Cajun but I decided I wanted to learn
how to block in fish cuz I like black
and fish so through trial and air this
is how we came up with it
so see starting to turn white
again and we'll flip it see what she
looks
like see with the different rub to get a
little bit different of a look on
it
okay I'm going get ready to pull this
one
off I think when I when I pull this one
off I'll show you what the other side
looks
like this is kind of a a good fun thing
to do for a company because
one it's
probably not something that's been uh
been a lot of people get so or know how
to do so it's kind of it's kind of a fun
thing to do for company so all right I'm
going to pull this one
off flip it over there you go that's
what that's what your blacken fish is
going to look
like
all
good
