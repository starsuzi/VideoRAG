hi everyone and welcome back to cooking
chair today we're doing one of the most
popular Street Foods in the Philippines
ququ so let's get cooking our
ingredients are corn starch anat powder
quail eggs allpurpose flour salt pepper
water and cooking
oil the first step we're just going to
take a common Ziploc bag and we're going
to put the cornstarch
in and we're going to place the quail
eggs
in now we're going to seal the
bag and now we're going to give them a
shake so they're nicely coated all
over now the the reason we're doing this
is just to make sure the batter sticks
to the
egg we're going to go to the next step
which is combining the all-purpose flour
with some
salt
pepper and we're going to mix this well
until it's well
Incorporated next we're going to dilute
the anat powder by adding it to the warm
water and we're going to whisk this
well until it's just about like
this now we're going to add the anat
mixture to the flour
mixture once again whisk until it
becomes a
batter next we're going to place the
eggs in the
batter now we're just going to stir
these around until they're fully coated
with the
batter
you can see the batter is thick and
sticky so we're just going to spoon it
over make sure it's fully
coated Next Step we're going to add the
cooking oil to a
pot and we're going to turn the heat on
and bring this up to deep frying
temperature which is about 350Â° or about
177 180 in
C and we're going to place our eggs into
the
oil we'll deep fry these in batches for
1 to two minutes now be careful because
the oil's hot and it might Splash back
on
you until they're a nice golden brown
just about like this now we're just
going to remove them from the oil and
set them aside on a plate with paper
towel to
drink next we're going to make our sauce
and the ingredients for this is garlic
chili peppers now this is if you want a
spicy if you don't want it spicy you can
eliminate the Chili Peppers soy sauce
vinegar
sugar now if you want it sweeter you can
simply add more sugar corn starch and
water and the method is pretty simple
we're just simply going to combine the
soy sauce with our
water
vinegar
sugar corn
starch
garlic chili peppers
and we're going to stir this until it's
well
combined now we're going to place it
into a preheated
saucepan and we're going to whisk until
it reaches the desired
thickness until it's just about like
this this is just about the perfect
thickness and after the sauce is done
we're ready to
serve now we're going to pour the sauce
over our
ququ and here is our ququ and believe me
