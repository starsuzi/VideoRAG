well hopefully i won't need to explain
too much but
all all we're seeing here is the edge of
where the paddock has been sprayed with
compost tea and the area here behind us
which is the track
where it hasn't been sprayed and how
it's dominated with onion grass so i
don't think it
it takes a road scholar to understand
that
compost tea does increase production and
um
and does encourage
the the better species to grow
onion grass is a real problem around our
area and
it's very unproductive and it can be
controlled chemically but we find that
controlling it through herbicides also
removes your clover from your paddock so
we're looking for another way to
to move forward with it
well if you can
have the biology
you have you can set up the biology in
the soil which you're obviously doing
so that the onion grass doesn't want to
grow and you're not using any poisons
well you must be well ahead in terms of
growth growing instead of poisoning
while poisoning something you're going
backwards in
productivity for that period yeah and
then of course you get a burst then you
usually have to re-sow the paddock um
now here what you're doing without
resewing you're getting
the onion grass being um
[Music]
put into a
much lower position of dominance yeah it
certainly looks that way
