hello my name is Rachel McAn and today
we're going to be making anet cookies
now these are a very simple Australian
biscuit and they originated in World War
I now for this biscuit simple to make
we're actually using equal parts of
flour plain flour sugar I'm using castor
sugar oats and slightly less coconut so
I've got a cup of each of the main
ingredients and 3/4 of a cup of coconut
we then use 125 G of butter 2 tbsp of
golden syrup and a small amount of
bicarbonate of soda we're going to add
each of these to our mixing
bowl so this is our 1 cup of plain
flour we have 1 cup of castor
sugar one cup of
oats and about 3/4 of a cup of
coconut all right so the next step is to
add our 2 tbsp of golden syrup to our
125 G of
butter and it doesn't really matter if
you use salted or unsalted butter I'm
prefer the salt in
it so that's one and it doesn't have to
be exact so just rough measurements is
fine
I'm just going to pop that in the bowl
we're going to take that over to the
stove and we're going to melt that
butter
[Music]
now now the butter is melted we can
bring it back to the dry
[Music]
ingredients this is definitely the best
part of making anet cookies we have our
half a te spoon of bicarbonate of soda
in the container we're just going to add
a small amount of boiling
water and we're going to stir that
[Music]
around so the lovely reaction between
the bicarbonate of soda and the butter
means that you get this fluffiness to it
and these bubbles that will create a
lightness in the
cookie I'm now going to add this to my
mixture my dry mixture over
here so just pour it all in there on top
of the dry
ingredients and we just going to mix
that all
[Music]
through you can see that that's all
blending beautifully and you can smell
the golden
[Music]
syrup so now that that's all mixed
together beautifully I can clear away my
mess and I can take out my baking trays
ready to shape my cookies
[Music]
