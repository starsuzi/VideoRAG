hey guys today we're going to make this
simple dresser before we get started I
just want to say that if you don't have
wood you can also use cardboard card
stock and
paper I started out by making a sketch
of the dresser in the right size
[Music]
then using that as a guide I drew the
pieces for the sides one for the top a
back side and a piece for the
bottom when I made the sketch and also
now when I make sketches for New pieces
of furniture I don't spend time
calculating how much more less space I
need on some pieces for them to fit
together instead I just file the pieces
down a bit as I go if some of them don't
fit

perfectly the wood I'm going to be using
is Basswood and I got this from a local
miniature store most miniature stores
and craft shops that specialize in
supplies for building models should have
a selection of wood like this I have
boards that are 6 or 7 mm thick and then
a variety all the way down to 75
mm I then cut out and transferred all
the pieces to the wood and used my saw
to cut it out
[Music]
[Music]
at this point I hadn't cut out any
pieces for the drawers except for the
front pieces
as you can see I just roughly cut out
the different shapes and I then used my
electric file and a normal file to sand
down the wrist
[Music]
[Music]
then begin gluing the pieces together I
first added the sides to the back piece
the front pieces and the
top any glue made for wood will work for
this
[Music]

[Music]
I also cut pieces off a skinny popsicle
looking stick and glued these to the
inside for the drawers to rest
on using the front pieces for the
drawers and the measurements from the
dresser as a guide I then cut and glue
together the pieces for each of the
drawers you'll need three pieces in
total for the sides and then one sheet
of wood for the bottom
[Music]
lastly I took a square strip of wood and
marked off the two front legs or feet
then used my electric file and a craft
knife to shape them
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
glue the feet to the dresser and sand
down any edges if
[Music]
needed I then took some filler and went
over some of the spaces or cracks before
sanding down the surface you can get
this at any hardware store
[Music]
store if you want your dresser to look
really neat or brand new you'll need to
use a fine grid sandpaper or
file paint it in any color of your
choice as most of you probably know by
now I prefer old or vintage looking
things so I didn't try to be too neat
with the paint and after the paint had
dried I used a file to sand it off some
of the
[Music]
edges to make the knobs I cut a strip
from this really thin sheet of copper
and bent a piece of copper wire I used
my round nose PES to make little tubes
from the strip and glued them to the
dresser like this
finally I added some patina to the knobs
and some brown acrylic paint to the
dresser itself
