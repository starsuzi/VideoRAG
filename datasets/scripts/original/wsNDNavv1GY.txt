what's that
what the heck is up
what the heck is that sound
what the heck is that sound
if something got in there
it's like there's a leaf or Sando stuff
that's a no stop my horn works my front
brake works hey I just got to put I'm
just gonna try not to use my friend
brake at all because the brake fluid is
starting to leak out the little the
little clear window is starting to break
so they told me I could put a dime on
the little window and glue it to it it
just happens to be the exact size of a
dime so that'll save me like sixty
dollars and you know replacing the whole
thing or something so I'm gonna try my
best not to use my front brake unless
it's like you know emergency stop of
course I'm just gonna cut through here
cuz I don't feel like waiting at the
light just keep moving and get the wind
on me
that was weird I saw the reverse lights
on that car light up so how save you
front brake fluid window cap thing
in this 10-cent fix you yeah see he's
got his reverse lights on again
that's weird I'm gonna stay back a
little bit like when he's got his brake
lights hooked up to his reverse lights
that's interesting I guess they're
brighter than the brighter than his
brake lights interesting I'm not sure
how legal that is though not to mention
confusing people are gonna think he's
backing up I thought he was that's why I
was about to stop back and then I
realized they when the brake lights
turned off the reverse lights turned off
weird is that a new thing No
it's a weird thing that you just think
that well it seems to be okay now I
don't know what the stone was maybe a
bug was in there I just glued that in
there and I gotta let it sit for like 24
hours come on focus
thank you yes there we go that's a good
view I couldn't get in there on the
bottom right corner couldn't quite get
in there cuz this plastic things in the
way here but this is supposed to fix the
leaky brake fluid problem so once this
dries I was told to shove a piece of
paper in between there I can't quite see
the there we go I can't even see my
screen this is so bright out here
but shove a piece of paper in there so
it kind of keeps it in place for a while
then after 24 hours it's supposed to be
a good 10 cent fix plus superglue or
whatever that cost so I'm waiting on
that to dry completely and then I'm
gonna do that
