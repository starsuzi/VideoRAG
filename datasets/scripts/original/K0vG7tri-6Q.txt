start the recipe is put my white
chocolate chips in a sauce pan and I'm
going to melt them over medium heat and
I'm going to stir constantly it won't be
smooth but it's not a problem and it'll
all come
together okay the chocolate's done so
I'm going to turn this off and I'm going
to stir in my lemon
curd we're going to stir this until it's
all
smooth my chocolate and lemon curved
mixture is smooth so now what I'm going
to do is pour it over my check

all over this uh into the cereal until
it's all well coated trying not to break
up any of the cereal
my cereal is all coated so now what I'm

is Seal our bag up

shaking and get it all coated with the
