hey guys I'm going to just show you how
to adjust your blade on the ultimate
mandolin you can see right here there's
an arrow that can point to thick or thin
slices and right on this side there's
this little lever that you can move down
or up or side to side to each one that
you want and if you also look you can
pull the blade out
completely and you get even better shot
of the thick or thin here and then on
the back it even shows you there's an
little arrow that can show you which way
to position it if you have a little bit
of a difficulty moving this you can even
press down slightly on this lover and
move it but usually you just need to do
side to side and it'll move for
you so do that then you're said
