hey everybody today I want to show you
how to make my mother's favorite dish
anytime I ask my mom you know hey you
want me to cook for you you want
something you want me to make you
something she's like can you make me
some glazed carrots I mean who thought
glazed carrots could be a superstar but
I'm going to show you how with just four
ingredients that's right 1 2 3 4 not 25
ingredients how in four ingredients you
can make super tasty easy glazed carrots
now I'm not a fan of traditional glazed
carrots that add sugar or honey to get
that sweetness I actually want to
extract the sweetness from the carrots
themselves and so with a little bit of
coing from some butter some chicken
stock and some fresh time you're going
to have some sweet and S glazed carrots
in no time so let's get started
okay you're not going to believe how
easy and fail prooof this is so all you
want to do is I've got a pan here I just
want to put it on high heat not medium
high you can't be afraid of a big flame
and I'm just going to
take about 2 tbspoon of butter I know
it's a lot but I mean you're eating
carrots so it's okay so we just want to
get this in here and get it melted to
that I'm going to add
oh how much time is that five or six
sprigs and let me teach you a trick the
leaves are going to fall off so we're
just going to put the whole thing in
here and then we'll just pull out the
stems later versus going through and
picking up all the leaves into the
butter I know you're like what are you
doing I'm serious this
works as that's melting
around cuz you want to get the time in
there all nice and good with the butter
beautiful I've got about one pound of
baby carrots here and the thing about it
is with me and baby carrots I'm going to
be eating them they look fine to me most
people think they're just for a snack
but I like to cook with them versus
cutting up carrots which can be a chore
so in go the
carrots and as you can see that's about
enough to cover the bottom of the pan
that's about what you want in the in a
flat
layer so now you just want to toss the
carrots in the butter and in the time
you kind of just want to warm them up a
little bit which is why you want your
heat to be on high it's a little bit of
salt because as it reduces that it'll
get
saltier so I probably added 1/4 teaspoon
you can always add some towards the
end you kind of want to just let these
sauté for a second you just want to get
warm
once the butter starts to smell a little
nutty or turns like a slight golden
brown you want to take your chicken
stock and all you want to
do is add enough chicken stock to cover
the
carrots you don't want them to be
swimming in
it you want to get them all in there
maybe a little bit more
perfect and guess what leave it alone
leave it on high heat let it cook until
all the stock evaporate and you'll know
it's time to take them off when you hear
the carrots start to sauté again because
all the liquid will be gone and it will
be just be carrots and butter and Thyme
sauté and Away in the pan all right stay
tuned
this is the point you want to get to
where all you have left is the butter
look at that you see that that is your
glaze just pull
out the time prigs the majority of the
leaves will have fallen
off and you just pull them out don't
burn yourself I'm a trained professional
and they're done look at that beautiful
glazed
carrot cut them off add a little bit of
salt a little bit of
pepper and you are good to go
