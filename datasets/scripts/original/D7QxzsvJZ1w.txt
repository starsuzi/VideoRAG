- You know what, folks?
Making our own homemade clotted cream
is actually really, really easy.
It is, it is easy.
It just takes a lot of time.
That's it.
Come to think of it,
it is actually a very
British thing indeed.
Yes, it is.
It's pretty much almost as British
as saying sorry to everything.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I do say sorry quite a lot.
I do.
Sorry.
In fact, recently I did a
video recipe with my mother
on some awesome lemon and blueberry scones
and I hinted in that video
that I was gonna show you how,
so today I'm gonna show you how.
So, for this recipe you just need
one ingredient and that is double cream,
also known as heavy cream.
Just be sure not to get the
ultra pasteurised stuff.
I'm not gonna go into
pasteurisation and all that stuff
but basically it's the heating,
you don't want it to be ultra pasteurised.
Pasteurised is fine.
That's what I went for.
I hope you're ready for these steps.
The first thing you need to do
is grab yourself a baking dish,
a clear, long, rectangular one is ideal.
Then just simply pour
your cream into the dish.
It would probably be about
two inches or so deep
but that's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Well, apart from pre-heating your oven
to 80 degrees centigrade,
I'm using my hand to make it
so you can actually see I
am preheating my oven there,
please make sure that your oven
doesn't switch off after a few hours
because that will annoy
you and it won't work.
That's more important.
When the oven's at the right temperature,
place it in there
and then figure out what you want to do
for 12 hours
because it needs 12 hours.
I'm going to show you exactly
what it's supposed to look like.
So, this is a package of clotted cream
that you would get in most
of the shops here in the UK,
quite a well-known brand
and as you can see,
it's got a gorgeous golden-y
sort of crust on the top
and underneath it
is the most succulent tasting cream.
It is delicious.
So, I figured I would make sure
that it is good.
I sliced up a scone,
put some cream and jam on it
and well, that killed
five minutes, didn't it?
Very tasty indeed.
You could sing power ballads in your car.

Truth be told, I've got 12 hours to kill,
so I'm going to go home.
Then I come back here 12 hours later.
Half past nine at night
while I should be sat there drinking wine,
watching terrible telly with Mrs. Barry.
I take it out of the oven.
I let it cool to room temperature.
It smells a bit like cheese.
I'm sort of excited.
Place it in the fridge covered
and I'll see it in the morning.
Basically another 12 hours.
When we come back in the morning
and reveal that layer,
we're gonna have that nice,
gorgeous crust on there.
You want to spoon that off
but what you are left with
is actual clotted cream
and it tastes absolutely
out of this world,
kind of almost fresher
than the store-bought stuff
and quite a bit cheaper.
You can store it in a container
for around five to six days,
unless you want to give it to someone
as a gift for Christmas.
If you want to do that, you can
but I would recommend serving
it pretty much immediately
because well, it's gorgeous.
Very Moorish and very naughty indeed.
On your merry way then, folks.
