hi this is Sarah from
politicallyincorrect
health.com and today I'm going to show
you how to make butter and buttermilk
because if you make one you're going to
get a product of the other so it's
actually very simple to do first we're
going to culture the
buttermilk and right here I have about
four cups or one quart of cream that I
separated from the
milk I showed you how to do that in a
previous
video um
I've left it on the counter a little bit
just because uh some of the cream was
previously frozen um you just you kind
of want it to be in a warm
area I'm covering it with a towel so it
can breathe because we're just going to
culture it a little bit and what you
have to do you have to make sure it's in
a warm part of the kitchen or else it's
going to take longer to culture so if
the kitchen isn't warm you want to put
it in a warm part of your house you want
to leave it there 12 up to 24 hours
probably if it's not warm enough and uh
we're just going to wait and then I'm
going to show you the
rest hey we're back so the the cream has
been sitting out on the counter for
about 24 hours um if you don't want to
culture the butter or anything you don't
have to do the Step at all you can just
use the cream Straight
Ahead just going to pour right in here
um and my food processor actually has a
max liquid fill line right
here just going to uh process it it's
going to take about 10 minutes I think
it just depends on how much liquid you
have really oh and by the way this isn't
the only way you can make butter you can
actually use just a jar a sealed lid
like a mason jar and you can just shake
it um that would be a fun project for
kids but but personally I like to just
speed things up um another way you can
do it right in your Vitamix or your
blender you can do it with a hand
blender too so there's many ways to do
[Music]
this let's check on
this all right it looks ready to
me um I just want to show you you you
can see how the butter separated from
the butter milk see the butter are the
solid yellow pieces and the buttermilk
is
the not exactly white color but it's the
Milky type of
color um and we're actually going to
separate
that
it's not very solid just because it's
been sitting out at room temperature for
about 24
hours um let me get a
strainer
I just don't want to lose any of my
butter
this is from about two cups of cream
here um but as I showed you before I
couldn't do the whole batch all at
once
and if you're wondering what you can do
with buttermilk um usually people use it
in baking like cookies and um just cakes
other things like that um also if you're
soaking any of your grains you can use
it sometimes as an acidic medium instead
of apple cider vinegar or or lemon juice
just usually whatever you have on
hand there's a tiny bit more liquid left
we want to get that
out right now going to put a little
filtered water in
it and what I'm GNA do is actually
called washing the
butter this is an important step to do
so make sure you don't skip
it there a little buttermilk in here
too just going to get all the solids
that came up on
top
[Music]
is
should be about
good I usually do this about one time
but you can do it a couple times just to
be
sure I think this is actually good I
don't need to do it a second
time but if you want to make sure that
the the flavor is less cultured I would
recommend doing this
step this would not be your buttermilk
so you don't want to pour that and mix
it in with your
buttermilk
next what you want to do is just put
this in any sort of dish for storage and
you can add salt to it you can add any
sort of flavor to it to make it compound
butter and that's all you have to do to
make butter and
buttermilk and I hope you keep it real
in the kitchen
