hey guys what is up gaming guy here with
another episode of Fallout 4 today I am
giving you guys a tutorial of how to
make a siren so let's get straight into
it first of all you will need a place to
put your siren so I'm going to put it on
the top of my base as you see so you
rock
in you go
to the place you want to put it you go
into your Workshop
and you will need
to first off put down the sirens so you
will need to go to resources and
miscellaneous and you will need to
scroll down almost all the way to this
s and you will place however many you
want I have three cuz I'm going to put
down a small
generator and as you see it requires one
power so I already have that set up so
I'm going to go into generators see the
generator the small generator produces
three power so this is perfect isn't it
I'm going to place it where you want to
you're going to go
back
and press triangle or Y
on the generator and then it will
connect a wire made out of fuses or
copper and then you need to drag it over
to the siren and press it
again and it is connected as you see it
is on these aren't you will need to do
that to however many Simons you
have boom
now you can exit your Workshop you have
your generator that you can turn on or
off I like it off but I wish it was sort
of smaller I mean smaller actually I do
wish it was smaller and a little bit
more quiet so going to press X or a on
your sirens and they will turn on
as you see your people will start to
freak out and run
everywhere you're just glitched what
were you doing she was like floating in
midair um they will run into my house if
I they will run towards the siren if you
turn them
on or at least of my experience they
have
so
you actually Mak the easier just
to turn
that and turn off the
[Music]
