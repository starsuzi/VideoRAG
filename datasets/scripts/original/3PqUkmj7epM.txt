um we're gonna do an experiment yeah
yeah okay so for this one we need some
honey and I happen to have this old jar
of honey it was almost gone and I bought
a new one and it's been sitting in there
for like eight years and so we're just
gonna use that up
and it's I've heated it up so it's not
crystallized I need some water
five jars
we're gonna put water in those a
teaspoon measuring stick a measuring
device and a tablespoon and then I also
want a timer and our freezer and we're
going to test
to see
how honey crystallizes with different
consistencies of honey and water
okay so what we're going to do is we're
going to put we've marked these
we're gonna put one teaspoon of water in
here plus one tablespoon of honey
two teaspoons of water tablespoon of
honey three teaspoons of water
tablespoon of honey four tablespoons of
teaspoons of water and one tablespoon of
honey and then just one tablespoon of
honey
and then we're going to stick them in
the freezer
then we're going to turn on our timer
and every two minutes we're going to
open up the freezer and see which one
has crystallized
and then we're going to see which one
does it first which one do you think
will crystallize first
the one with
a little bit of water with lots of water
or with no water
you think the one with no water is going
to crystallize first
that's your hypothesis
okay let's test it so we're going to put
the water in and then I'll come back and
then we'll do the honey
okay
so we put
a tablespoon of honey in each one and
then we put one teaspoon two three four
teaspoons in those and now what are you
doing
mixing it all together so it's all mixed
together huh
you want to make sure it's nice and
mixed together
is that all mixed together
you ready to do the next one
yeah here
okay now mix the next one
and then we're gonna put these in the
freezer and start our timer
so we mixed everything up
our honey is in the freezer
that one in the back has one teaspoon
two three four and this is straight
honey
and then we're gonna wait two minutes
and see if any of them have crystallized
and then we're gonna do it again so
tauren hit start
good job
okay we're gonna wait
minutes
okay tauren let's come look at the honey
and see what we've got
I'm gonna open this really carefully
and tauren come look
have any of them crystallized
a little slower
no I don't see any crystals
nothing yet should we wait another two
minutes
three minutes and 30 seconds
from our last measure
let's check and see
you see anything looking like it's
crystallized
what do you think
um
I don't see any
it almost looks like the honeys
the straight Honey's the most affected
interesting
half minutes open it carefully carefully
see if we see anything crystallizing in
here
you know the only one that looks like
it's gotten really really stiff
is the honey
yeah Honey's not even moving now
the honey crystallized first
and this one is still really liquidy
yeah that's like totally crystallized
already
yeah what about this one this one will
probably go next oh it's starting to get
a little stiff
yeah
that's the one with just one teaspoon of
water
interesting I was right downwind is that
the one you said yeah okay
tauren wins okay we'll keep checking on
this in a few more minutes
so open it carefully let's see if any of
the others are crystallizing
uh
so we already knew this one is pretty
solid
let's see if any of the others are
starting to crystallize
oh that one's getting more solid still
not there yet
okay
so we lost track of time it's been an
hour and 20 minutes
checking our honey ah
tauren you should come look
this is interesting
what so the honey it solidified first
right so it's just hard and it's not
moving
her
but look which one went froze first
the one with water with four that's the
four
that one's almost completely Frozen
let's see what the other ones are doing
so I don't think the Honey's actually
Frozen
yeah look oh that's interesting
so that one has just one teaspoon of
water
two teaspoons
three teaspoons
the Honey's solidified so it's kind of
crystallized and then the one that went
first
is the one with four teaspoons because
that's just water
whoa
been two and a half hours since we put
them in
and
that's basically yeah it's a little
sticky
but it's not moving that's frozen solid
thank you
and that is the least solid of them all
fascinating
huh one and two still haven't Frozen at
two and a half hours
that's pretty cool
down three has finally started to freeze
cool
