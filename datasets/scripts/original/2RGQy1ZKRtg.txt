so I've got a lovely hot pan here and
I'm going to add some Dy streaky bacon
into the pan it's a dry pan I haven't
added any extra fat next I'm going to
add eight pieces of chicken on the bone
into my pan we're just going to turn
those pieces in the
pan next I'm going to add a tablespoon
of plain
flour some dry white wine now you could
use stock if you want to right so next
in go our
leaks I've just left these whole in
their skins but you could have them if
you want to then some creeme fresh and a
little Dijon mustard which will just
give a lovely flavor to the finished
dish so just give that a good stir bring
it up to the boil and then I'm just
going to reduce it down to a
simmer Hot Pot goes straight from the
stove into your Wonder bag pop its
little hat on and then just pull the
drawrings to seal the whole thing
up so let's get my Wonder bag
open and get some supper sorted
[Music]
out oh that smells absolutely fantastic
I think all it needs now is a little bit
of seasoning some fresh herbs and I'm
ready to
[Music]
eat
