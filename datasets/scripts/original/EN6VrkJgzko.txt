00:22 Speaker 1: Gidday Knuckleheads.
Uncle Knackers is here.
[pause]
00:30 S1: How in the hell are you supposed
to cut a straight line?
Well never fear.
Uncle Knackers is here with a secret little
tip that will have you cutting a straight
line like a pro in no time.
Let's do it.
00:50 S1: Righto.
So what do you need for this job?
Well, you need one of these, a clamp.
And you need one of these, builder's square.
[Air guitar] That was a great guitar.
You need a set of these and a pair of these
goggles to cover these goggles.
Looking good!
Let's get to work.
01:31 S1: The first thing you need to do,
depending on which type of circular saw you
have, is to determine the distance between
the edge of your fence and the inside of your
blade.
You can do it with a tape measure, but a more
accurate way of doing it is to set up your
builder's square and do a dummy run on the
scrap.
Watch closely and I'll show you how to do
that.
01:57 S2: The first thing you want to do is
grab your builder's square, put that part
up against the back edge, make sure it's nice
and square and grab your clamp and pack it
to your square, nice and tight.
[pause]
02:24 S1: Okay.
Step number two.
We're getting up to the exciting stuff.
Take your circular saw and the idea is to
run the edge of this fence, up in there, hard
up against...
Built a square edge here and getting it nice
and tight.
This is going to produce a line for us that
we can measure off as a reference point.
[pause]
03:14 S1: We now got a nice straight line
here, but the purpose of the exercise here
is to get the measurement.
So you measure for a fresh new cut, back to
the edge of a builder's square.
In this instance, it's 40 mm.
That's all we need to know.
03:32 S1: Okay, step number three.
Let's do it.
Okay.
It's a fun step.
Are you excited?
You see here I've already put a line there.
That's the line that I want to cut, okay?
Now, if you remember back in step two, the
edge of our finished cut back to the builder's
square was 40 mm.
So that's what we need to mark on this timber
now.
Back from the line that I just put there,
okay?
So let's measure 40 mm.
Grab the tape.
Ten, 20, 30, 40...
Put a mark on 40 mm.
That's our reference line.
Okay, grab your builder's square, put it back
up again, and make sure that's nice and snug
up against that 40-mm line that I just marked.
Grab your clamp.
Clamp it off.
And now, it's the moment of truth.
Let's give it a whirl.
[pause]
05:16 S1: Look at that, absolutely perfect.
Great, Team Knackers!
