so now that you have
everything uh this pointing up this one
pointing down what you're going to do is
you're going to interlock them
[Music]
together the two
rows and then you're going to take your
uh needle nose
pliers and you're going to bend each one
of them
you're going to bend them this
way and the other ones the other
way and you're going to go all the way
down the row
eventually you're going to come out with
something like this and then uh use the
same technique for the bottom you're
going to cut a square out of the piece
that you had left over and using the
same technique you're going to
put the square over here and then you're
going to bend the edges securing it
solidly to
this and
then after you do that you can cut all
the
holes
for the nipple holder which is
this then you can put the
nipple goes right in here
and then you
insert the whole
piece at the
bottom and
eventually it'll look like
this then what you do after this since
you already have this Edge cut over here
uh you can use your Dro you can use your
wire cutters they both work pretty much
the same and what you're going to do is
you need this whole cut on top of
your your top that you have already
built all you have to do is cut a hole
right
here
and you're going to
attach this here by simply
bending the pieces of wire The Stick
Over the Top all you have to do is bend
them over the edge and uh there you have
your foot Hopper then you can connect
your water hose right here and uh and
it's pretty nice they've been working
for me for about a year and there's no
way they can get out and I only feed
them once a week uh change the water
once a week and it's pretty maintenance
uh free or as much maintenance free as
you can can afford and uh that's all I
have uh thank you for
watching
