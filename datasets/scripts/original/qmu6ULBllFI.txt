Hi! I'm Louis Ortiz on behalf of Expert Village
and today we are going to show you how to
clean and prepare, for cleaning actually,
a leek. Leeks are great to use in all kinds
of stocks; usually seafood stocks, chicken
stock, vegetable stock, they are a great addition.
At first glance, you notice the similarity
to green onions essentially. The green onions
and chives that usually come from this will
come from the top of the leaves as well as
the base. As you know from a green onion,
its a much more dense and compacted along
the stalk here and a little less on the leaves.
So with leek, we just kind of want to take
off those leaves. So I'm just going to make
a cut with my utility knife here and takes
these guys off; move those. On the base, I
don't want to cut too high up this direction
above the roots simply because it will pull
it apart. So I am going to get as close to
the base as I can still leaving everything
connected. That way, remove that. What I like
to do is cut these in half at this point,
straight down the center. That way we can
rinse the inside as well as the base and as
we cut this direction, we get some nice little
half circles that come off of the leek here
and they are nice and uniformed. I'll come
back in just a second, rinse these guys and
show you what kind of cuts we can get out
of these.
