something you may not know about me I'm
the world's biggest impulse buyer now
some things that I've bought in the past
was a drum set piece of art a bed frame
and it's just a problem that I have
impulse buying I went to a store to find
some elastics so I go to this craft
store to buy these 60 like mini a lot
mini rubber bands now when I was on my
hunch to find these rubber bands I got
distracted buying this uh Twisted
tie-dye cuz it looks freaking awesome
huh bright colors I figured I'd give it
a shot so today I'm going to make with
you guys twisted tie-dye tank tops cuz
it's the summer and you wear you wear
tank tops in the summer okay let's give
this a shot it makes 12 shirts but I
only bought two so let's do it this is
how to make a tie-dye t tank top it says
it's clean and it's easy let's open this
let's open this thing
up oh okay ripped
it that is definitely not how you open
the
box
there
okay okay so these are the fabric One
Step fabric D tablets Step One open your
foil packet there are four tablets color
so here's the D tablets they have four
blue four red and four yellow Place one
tablet in each corresponding color
bottle one in the red
[Music]
one boom we have red we have yellow and
we have blue now to get these colors
right here we have to mix like boom boom
boom I think it says this instructions
now to get a little bit of
orange we now have orange welcome to the
family orange now we need some purple
which is going to be red and
[Music]
blue how to prepare your garment wet
your garment with clean water then ring
it out before dying so I got a medium
white T-shirt here that the instructions
say I need to wet first so let's go and
wet this
t-shirt okay so this shirt is completely
soaked it then said ring it
out take your wet garment and twist it
so that it fits into the smaller tube of
the dye container there's no freaking
way there's no way I didn't even really
twist it it's just going to be all
splotchy fit damn it okay we did it so
line up the freaking holes but the holes
don't stay did it let the die
set
what yo I got to let this thing set for
13 hours I am not that
patient this thing is not at all going
as planned
[Music]
here this thing lied it's not it's
honestly not as clean as it's
advertising it just looks like a gunshot
wound
[Music]
here oh what is that flaw it shoots at
the
[Music]
bottom this is so freaking stupid now
it's
stuck the problem is I'm squeezing it
but it's falling between the two
[Music]
tubes this isn't Fun aren't I supposed
to be having fun like I'm really not
having
fun see it falls through the two tubes
directly into the
top like a snow cone
[Music]
all right I think I'm happy with
that
oh oh you are a joke I need to go get
more cloth this thing is just leaking
like so there you guys have it I'm going
to wait 13 hours now to see what this
shirt looks
like this was a terrible invention but
let's give it 13 hours and we'll come
back and see how it looks
13 hours later brings me into the next
day which what today is oh terrible
start de's a tiey shirt a lot more
colorful now I must admit I think the
ink has kind of seeped down into the
white Parts um but I'm looking forward
to opening this
[Music]
thing okay let's
see uh not bad very it's like you see
like they got like the lines it's very
tight high. it's kind of nice I like it
it's not bad for the first time there is
a lot of white that I would have liked
to get rid of right here butth the colar
blue a lot of color on this side okay so
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
turn this into a tank top so now to make
a tank I usually start from just below
the
armpit now this one is for the one with
the wide shoulders but I'm going to get
rid of the uh the collar here as
[Music]
well so there is how you make a tie-dye
tank top there's the
back right there okay so there you guys
have it this is a tie-dye tank top um
this color I it's too much pink in it
for me and tie dye just really isn't my
thing but uh I figured I had to try out
