hello everyone and welcome to journey
through my 40s today i'm going to be
making my own fabric softener and the
ingredients we're going to use is white
vinegar 3 cups and 2 cups of
suave conditioner and i'm using mango
mandarin and we're going to need six
cups of water which i've already added
to my container
now i originally paid 7.97 for the
snuggle accelerations i believe it's on
sale right now for 6.97
i paid
297 for the white vinegar
gallon container and i paid 1.47 for a
22.5 ounce of suave conditioner
so with just three cups of the white
vinegar and the
two cups of suave conditioner that i
rounded it out to be it's going to cost
about 1.56 for those and then plus my
cost of water which i'm not really sure
what six cups of water would cost
so
since i've already added the water i'm
going to add the vinegar
and then we're going to
add approximately two cups
of the conditioner
let's see
all right just a little bit more
i'm trying to make sure i add
enough
okay
and i'm gonna put my lid on
and shake it up
and i have my conditioner
um there is
yeah
i'd say maybe that there is about the
same amount in here as when i bought it
so in that i'm just going to use
it's concentrated so i'm just going to
go ahead and use this little cup for
each load and that's it thank you for
watching and please join me at my blog
