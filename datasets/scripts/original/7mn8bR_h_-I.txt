hi everyone this is sandy welcome to
easy cooking so today recipe is going to
be a mexican dish this one has been
highly requested in my channel so today
i'm finally showing you how to make red
enchiladas they are very easy to make
very popular in mexico and in the united
states too the preparation time is going
to be about 20 minutes and the cooking
time is about 20 minutes too so i really
hope you enjoyed this recipe let's get
started
let's go through the ingredients
we need chiles anchos you will find them
at the grocery store in the
international aisle we also need five to
six chiles guajillos you will also find
them in the international aisle at the
grocery store
two roma tomatoes
a quarter of a small onion one garlic
clove
two chicken breasts if you have any
leftover chicken you can use that
instead we need corn tortillas
for garnish i'm using queso fresco crema
mexicana and i'm also using half a small
onion cutting slices and for seasoning
i'm only using salt to taste and a pinch
of ground cinnamon
we also need about 3 cups of boiling
water and vegetable oil
let's get started
i'm going to cook the chicken in boiling
water i season the water with plenty of
salt a garlic clove and a splash of oil
cook the chicken until well cooked
let it cool
shred it and set it aside until you're
ready to use it
now in a hot ski little griddle toss the
dried chilies for a couple of seconds on
each side
about 5 seconds on each side just to
bring out the flavor in them
be careful not to burn them because if
you burn them the sauce will be really
bitter
so just keep on toasting the chiles
until you're done
now in the same skillet add a splash of
oil and roast the tomatoes
also roast a quarter of a small onion
and the garlic cloth
set the heat to medium low just to make
sure the garlic won't get born
otherwise it will also give your sauce a
really bitter taste
let this ingredient toast on all sides
until the tomatoes and onions become
softer it will take around two or three
minutes on low heat
while that's cooking now remove the
stems seeds and veins from the dried
chiles and place them in a large bowl
[Music]
now that the dried chiles are done place
the roasted tomatoes onion and garlic in
the same bowl with the dried chiles and
pour about 3 cups of boiling water into
the bowl
let this ingredient soak in the hot
water for about 10 to 15 minutes
after 15 minutes or so now place all the
ingredients in a blender season with a
pinch of ground cinnamon and salt to
taste
blend everything on high for about 5
minutes or until you get a soft sauce
now strain the sauce and bring it to a
boil you can add more water if you need
to and also add a splash of oil
you don't want the sauce to be super
watery otherwise it won't stick to the
tortillas
so bring the sauce to a boil and add as
much water as you need to but remember
you don't want it to be super watery
in the meantime i'm going to heat up the
tortillas i like to fry my tortillas in
a little bit of oil just because the oil
gives them a better texture
and also allows them to hold together
better after i dip them in the sauce but
if you prefer you can heat up the
tortillas in the microwave is all up to
you
so after you have everything ready now
you can start making your enchiladas
grab a tortilla dip it in the sauce and
then add some chicken
roll it like a taco
and keep on doing this until all your
enchiladas are done
and that's about it now you can place
them in a baking dish
spoon some of the sauce all over the
enchiladas garnish with onion slices and
place them in a 350 degree oven for
about 8 to 10 minutes or until heated
through or if you prefer you can place
them in the microwave for about 2 or 3
minutes or until well heated
but if you want to kick the flavor a
little more and you want to do it the
old-fashioned way or at least the way my
grandma used to make them
now on a large skillet heat up a little
bit of oil and cook the enchiladas for
about one minute on each side this step
is optional you can skip it if you want
to but this step will take your
enchiladas to another level it will
ensure that the tortilla has absorbed
and seal all the flavors of the chili
sauce you will be able to smell all the
delicious goodness in that sauce as soon
as your enchilada touches the hot
skillet
it will be like double roasting the
chilis without actually doing it so this
step is actually worth the extra time it
does give your enchilada a richer flavor
so after you're done and you have cooked
the enchiladas for about one minute on
each side now place them on a baking
dish spoon some of the sauce all over
the enchiladas and garnish with onion
slices place them in the oven for about
8 to 10 minutes or until heated through
or place them in the microwave for about
two or three minutes or until well
heated
once they come out of the oven garnish
with queso fresco and serve
you can garnish with more queso fresco
and crema mexicana if you want
and that's about it enjoy i really hope
