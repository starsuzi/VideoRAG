and here we have the kitten's first bath
what you do is you fill up a sink with a
little bit of water
and let the cat roam around think until
it gets comfortable with the situation
Next Step play with the water show the
kitten that it's water
bring your hand up let her smell it
put some on her paw
maybe on her body
don't let her jump off
now she understands she's getting wet
but she's not fully soaked She's Not
Afraid yet
now you hopefully your cat will just
decide to jump into the water and love
it but most cats don't so what you're
gonna have to do is put it in there nice
and slow
so she gets comfortable with it one
so another step you get your hands what
pick up the kitten
and let it hover underwater
she looks at the situation
put her paws in
and then she meows what you want to do
is see if she'll stand in their own room
as you can see she's a little scared
if that's the case simply hold her in a
comfortable position
it's okay
and just pour water on or you can use a
small cup I use my hand
and you see how comfortable the kitten
is
now if your kitten decides to scratch
and run what she's thinking about doing
you can always grab him right here
behind the neck
and they just basically get paralyzed
and you can still hold them nice and
easy and give them a wash
and they understand what's going on and
they feel safe when they're paralyzed
because they know you're doing it for a
reason and they just go with it
once you've gotten the kitten fully wet
you can just go ahead and let it sit in
the sink and it'll examine your
situation again it understands you're
not hurting it if you take your time
while you do this it'll make her
comfortable with the situation for
future bath
now she's gonna try to get out I'm gonna
keep her in here
and just try to wash her I'm gonna use
some Dawn dish soap
so I let the kitten sit out if she wants
to while I keep losing her body down
here in the water get the Dawn dish soap
everywhere I can
and one more thing if you remember when
we started we had the water ready and we
didn't have the water running
because if you bring the cat in here and
the water is running she's gonna hear
the noise she's gonna see the movement
and try to run away with fear
we did let this cat watch the water fill
up from a distance so she understood the
water was uh flowing but she wasn't near
it to freak out so when we did bring her
close by
she kind of had an idea of the situation
so again he's going to get everywhere
you can avoid getting any water into
ears the mouth and the eyes you want to
wash everything down and then the head
area nice and easy
and when you're done washing the cat
you can uh go ahead and just get all the
soap off of her by pouring the water
that you already have
what I like to do is get rid of that
and allow the cat to understand flowing
water
right now her heart just started beating
even more but she feels comfortable and
she's not trying to run
to make it warm
can you let her see it hit her body
now I'm not holding her tight she's just
relaxed and trusting me right now she's
something new to her it's the first bath
she's ever had
I'm holding her right here behind the
neck
going everywhere I can
see if she'll just stand up
kind of
yeah
[Applause]
you can go ahead and get him right there
alongside their mouth around their nose
they're really dirty
[Music]
and pretty much just put wrap them up in
a towel dry them up it's gonna be good
to go and they get cold pretty easily
she's shivering right now but she'll be
fine
and here you have the finished product
one clean kitten shivering in the
blanket
waiting for your love
so you want to dry them off nice and
easy and let the cat walk away she'll
dry herself off
might take 20 minutes to an hour but
she'll be fine and back to playing in no
time
