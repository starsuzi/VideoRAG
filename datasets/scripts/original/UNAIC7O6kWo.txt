okay it's the final week for the
competition it's dessert week i thought
i'd do something a little bit different
with this video um and just tell you a
little story about how this recipe came
about um
a lot of us have talked on different
forums on the website about how our
significant others have been a lot of
help uh during this whole process and i
i have to give kudos to dave
for being very patient for these eight
weeks and um he got to a point that just
you know we'd be eating out having a
meal and he'd come up with ideas and i
have to admit he's come up with some
really good ideas for recipes
and one night i was talking about
wishing i could make some type of cream
cheese coconut brownie
it's three of my favorite flavors and he
said well i think you ought to take that
and put it in a bun pan and he said i
missed those uh cakes from childhood
that had that surprise center in the
middle when you cut into them
so we talked about it and he said well
what do you think what do you think
about doing that just make a brownie mix
do some kind of coconut cream cheese
filling put it in the middle um put some
brownie mix on top and bake it and he
said and i've got even a better idea
we'll try it out on mom on mother's day
he said what do you think and i said
well i kind of think that might be a
recipe for disaster but we gave it a try
and actually it turned out really good
and so that's the that's the recipe i'm
going to share with you this week so
just a shout out to all the significant
others that have helped us with our
ideas and it turned out not to be a
recipe for disaster at all but we
decided you know paula dean might like
the title and it would it maybe get her
attention so that's what we're going to
call it
and here it is it is a brownie bundt
cake with a cream cheese coconut filling
and i've topped it with just a simple
glaze made out of chocolate chips
uh
put some coconut and walnuts on top
and that's our recipe for disaster so
i'm going to show you in a few minutes
what we did to make it
and i'll be back thanks
we are going to start with a
store-bought brownie mix the one i
prefer comes with its own packet of
chocolate sauce that you add to the
batter
i always buy a plain brownie mix and
then i add to that my own walnuts
because i like a lot of nuts in mine
and so this way i can add as many as i
want and we also have
some just instant coffee granules i
learned a long time ago that if you add
coffee granules to anything chocolate it
just i don't know kicks that chocolate
flavor up another notch
so i think you'll enjoy that
and then
we're gonna follow the recipe on the box
mix for the brownies and it says to add
two eggs um some water and some oil
and then our surprise center filling
where cream cheese comes into play we're
going to put in philadelphia cream
cheese
and egg yolk
some vanilla
some sugar some all-purpose flour i'm
going to add some coconut then we're
going to stir in a little bit of
buttermilk to give it some moisture and
then we're going to cook it all
in a bun pan in this case i have a
silicone bun pan
that has been oiled and floured well
so i'm going to stir that up and when i
get it stirred up i'll come back and
i'll show you how we put in the surprise
center filling
we've talked about the ingredients for
our recipe for disaster cake so now i
just wanted to talk a little bit
about the preparation process you can
see that i have prepared my brownie mix
according to the package directions and
then i added the instant coffee granules
that we talked about stirred all of that
in stir in some walnuts mixed it well
then here is our secret cream cheese
coconut filling that's going to be in
the center of our cake when we slice it
and i have started putting the cake
together in the bundt pan here you can
see i've put just a little uh about half
maybe just a little more half of the
brownie mixture into the bottom of the
bun pan and i've started filling the
center then with our coconut cream
cheese mixture
and i want you to be real careful of
when you're putting this in i try to
keep it away from the very edge
and then when we put the rest of the
brownie mix on top of this and it
seals off
that way none of the cream cheese center
will show from the outside of the cake
and it'll truly be a surprise when
people slice into it
so i'm going to tell you i'll be honest
i've
tried a wooden spoon
i've tried a small teaspoon and i'm just
going to tell you ladies the easiest way
to do this center part is to just clean
your hands
get in there with your fingers and just
drop that by finger
by handfuls into the center and use your
fingers to press it down into the batter
so
i'm going to quit filming and go back to
building and i'll be back in a little
bit thanks
okay here's our recipe for disaster cake
right before it goes in the oven as you
can see i've used the rest of my brownie
mix
i've used it to hide our cream cheese
coconut filling
that's going to be in the center of the
cake
okay it's me food nut i wanted you to be
able to see the inside of it
you can see we've got just a luscious
amount of cream cheese and coconut on
the inside of our chocolate brownie mix
and i think it's something you're really
going to enjoy now there's some debate
in our house on how this should be
served dave thinks everything chocolate
should be served cold so he's going to
want his slice to go in the fridge stay
there for a little while and get good
and cold i'm saying it would be great
hot with maybe a little bit of vanilla
ice cream on the side and paula if i get
to make it for you and savannah that's
the way you'll get it because we've only
got an hour and
i won't have to time to cool it off so
i'm hoping ice cream tempt you even more
but i'm going to take a bite just like
it is
i promise you no matter how you decide
to serve it it's great enjoy
