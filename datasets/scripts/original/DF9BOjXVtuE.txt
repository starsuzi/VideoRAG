how to make a spider trap so to make
this you're going to need a 4x8 piece of
cardboard or foam board and some tape
then rip the tape in the two 8 in pieces
and one 4in piece then rip the 4in piece
in
half now you can put your tape on your
foam board

and now you're done with your homemade
spider sticky
trap so as you can see all you have to
do is put it on a corner and then wait
until the spider walks across it I hope
