Add honey and lemon and bring water to a simmer.
Dip the duck in the water and bathe the duck by scooping the water over the duck until the skin looks puffed up (takes 5-10 mins).
Remove the duck to a deep plate and set aside to cool.
Mix the five spice powder with the salt.
Scoop the spice mixture into the belly of the duck.
Use a brush to fully coat the inside of the duck with the spice mixture.
Stand the duck on a rack to drain and for the skin to dry out.
Place the duck onto a rack in a roasting pan, with the breast facing up. Roast the duck in the oven at 180°C (40 mins for each kg of duck).
Insert a food thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh. The duck is cooked if the temperature reaches at least 75°C.
The skin of the duck should be golden brown. If not, turn the temperature to 200°C and roast for another 5 mins.
Pour the sauce accumulated in the roasting pan into a bowl. Drain off the oil before serving with the duck.
