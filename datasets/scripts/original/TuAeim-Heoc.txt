now today I'm going to do a Greek style
of dish now what we're going to be
cooking with is lamb and lots of spices
and we're going to use Oro pasta all
comes together and makes something
really beautiful so first of all I just
want to go through the ingredients now
I've got it all laid out all kind of
measured out now with the lamb I'm using
lamb fillet and I've got 1 kg and it's
chopped into nice chunky pieces now the
spices got them laid out in this little
plate here I'm going to use two sticks
of cinnamon
half a teaspoon of ground cumin half a
teaspoon of ground coriander half a
teaspoon of chili flakes and then one
teaspoon of dried oregano now we're
going to season it with salt and freshly
ground black pepper use a little bit of
olive oil for frying off the lamb
chicken stock now I'm going to use
chicken stock two cubes of that mix that
with roughly about 1.2 L of boiling
water Tom purey just slightly riching it
up a little bit good splodge of that now
at the end we're going to use some
grated Parmesan cheese just to finish it
off I've got a can of tomatoes chopped
tomatoes then I've got this Oro which is
like a drum wheat pasture if you like
now I'm going to use 300 G of that that
bag's 500 G so I'm not going to use all
of it 300 G two
onions two green bell peppers three
carrots four cloves of garlic and then
I've got some fresh coriander just a
sprinkle over at the end so there's all
the ingredients now what I'm going to do
is get it all prepared chopped up go
over to the hob and we're going to start
by seasoning and Browning off the meat
now I've come over to the hob I've got
all the ingredients laid out all sort of
chopped up ready for cooking keeps your
life nice and simple now I'm going to be
cooking in this sort of cast iron pot so
whatever pot you've got that you can put
in the oven that maybe you'd cook stews
in use that one now I'm going to start
off with some olive
oil so you want a reasonable amount just
sort of cover the bottom
really and what we're going to do is fry
off the lamb now with the lamb I'm going
to quickly season
that so put some freshly ground black
pepper and also some salt
that's it now I'm going to switch the
heat
on going to put mine on about a medium
heat and then we'll add the lamb in
there just to Brown it off so you know
once you browned it off then we can
start adding the rest of the ingredients
now the pan just come up to heat so
let's just put
in all the lamb I mean what you can do
the lamb you could do it in a couple of
batches if you want but I'm just going
to move it around
I say you're just trying to get a little
bit of color on the
L now I haven't been cooking very long I
don't know five or so minutes starting
to get a bit of a color so that's good
now what I'm going to do
next just put all the rest of the
ingredients in like the
onions got the
garlic the
carrots the green pepper
and
also all those spices make it taste
wonderful the cinnamon
sticks now give that again a careful
move
around so everything's a little bit
coated so I've given that good mix
around now I'm just going to switch heat
off cuz what we're going to do now is
place it into a preheated oven and what
you want to do is halfway through is
just give it a mix over now I'm going to
cook this for half an hour as I say no
lid and temperature wise 180° C 350° F
gas Mark 4 now I've had the lamb cooking
for a total of 30 minutes and halfway
through we just turn the mixture over
and you know sort of got the got a
little bit of color on it look the
vegetables again just got a really nice
sort of color on top and the meat is
looking delicious now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to pour in
some tomato puring probably going to use
about half a
tube can of
tomatoes chopped
tomatoes now let me just give that a
quick
mix that's it giving that a quick mix
now I'm also going to pour in the stock
obviously I'm using chicken
stock it goes well with
this I got a fair amount of liquid here
it's getting a bit full up this pot but
I think we're okay so I put in the full
1.2
L now pop the lid
on quite a nice heavy lid sort of you
know keeps it
sealed so now we got the pot back in the
oven now we're going to carry on cooking
at the same temperature so 180° C now we
got the lid on remember now cook time I
would say roughly about 1 and 1/2 hours
or until your meat has become really
nice and tender now if you can during
that sort of cooking time just take it
out gently lift off the lid and if you
can just give it a gentle move around do
that a couple of times and that will be
great now I've had the lamb cooking in
the pot with the lid on for just over an
hour hour and a half so just going to
pull this
out and do it have a little
look now I
do want to see what the meat's like cuz
we do need to get that tender
so let me just grab piece of that
meat that bit on there do see how that
is that is starting to get really nice
and
soft lovely look at that now let me just
give that bit of a move
around some
here let me just check another
bit yeah that's that is becoming lovely
Nintendo look so easy to cut beautiful
now I think we can put
in that ozone I've got there I've
actually taken out 200 g I've got 300 G
going in
here put that
in now what you want to do is just give
this all the good mix around and then
what I'm going to quickly do is just
taste the dish for
seasoning I'm also going to take out
cinnamon as I found
it cuz we got nice cinnamon flavor but
uh don't really want that when we serve
it
up can't find the other
one but that's had a good mix now let me
just have a taste of this
[Music]
M that is lovely and that cinnamon
really is absolutely lovely with that
now I am going to put
in just a little bit of black
pepper and a little bit more salt cuz I
hav really put any more salt in other
than when we did it with the lamb you
see so just going
to adds more in
there and then what we do is put the lid
on
and then carry on
cooking the same temperature and I would
say probably for about another 20
minutes leave that cooking and what
you'll find is the ooso will start to
sort of suck up some of those juices so
leave that cooking see you in about 20
minutes now I've had that cooking for
the 20 minutes so we added that Oro
we've had 20 minutes now that would have
thickened up now what I did do after 10
minutes I did just give it a a quick
move around around and I reckon that's
really ready to serve up so I'm going to
take that over the table and go and
serve some up and enjoy it so I've taken
mine out the oven and in total I suppose
we've been cooking for the best part of
2 hours so that is going to be
absolutely
delicious now what I'm going to do is
move that back and slide it back now
before I do just want to show you the
mixture there what we
got look at that that's nice thickened
up
beautiful now what I am going to do
before I do finally serve it up just
going to sprinkle a little bit of
coriander on
mine
that and
also little bit of Parmesan
cheese H looks nice anyway now what I'm
going to do is get yourself a plate and
serve it up now in the background there
