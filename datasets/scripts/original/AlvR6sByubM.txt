something cool eight times more
adorable don't flake and peel
wow that's pretty
cool what is that a plastic tray
check
ooh it's all black that's
nice and it's wrapped
it's already all assembled so that's a
plus no assembling
required just take it out of the box and
you use it folks oo so this is where you
pay the big books the
ceramic it feels ceramic indeed I wonder
if it's just the coating or the actual
thing is
ceramic I don't know it's awesome though
okay looks like that's where the plate
goes I guess that's for spillage yeah M
I'm guessing
spillage anyways this handle goes like
this which is oh probably for storage I
would think yeah maybe for storage
yeah but anyways yeah that's pretty cool
pretty long so you just put your waffles
in close
