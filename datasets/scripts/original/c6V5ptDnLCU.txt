so now that we have that done going to
put a little bit more cornstarch down on
the
bottom going to put some on
top you always FL it out with your hand
and you always have to continue to pick
the fondon up and you pick up the corn
starch around you want to use a plastic
or poly orane rolling pin cuz it's the
perfect temperature it stays at room
temperature and it's got a nice weight
to perfect for rolling out
F okay so I roll it out and now I'm
going to lift it up a little bit cuz you
want to put a bring a little air under
it and then you're going to continue to
roll it out now after I roll it out
probably about 12 in long I'm going to
lift it up and turn it the other
way now I'm going to go back and
forth and every couple rolls you're
going to have to continue to lift up the
fondant to get a little air under there
so that she moves
nice we're looking to roll it out to
about an eigh of an inch
thick and you know in the summertime
it's a little bit more humid it's going
to stick more in the winter time it's
going to be a little more drier so the
humidity actually gives you a little bit
more stretch and the fondant is less
like likely to break or
rip One
Direction Another Direction so you got a
nice even round circle if you got any
air bubbles in there you could take a
toothpick and just pop them out then
smooth it with your fond down smoother
here let's go over the top of it perfect
