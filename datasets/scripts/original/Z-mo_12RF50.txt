this morning we're making waffles with
our new quinart waffle
maker and as you can see it's different
from most waffle makers in that it's
vertical so they give you a
scoop uh that comes with the WAFF maker
and
you use that exact amount and pour it in
here like that
wait until it's done now the thing is is
that
inside here I'm making a mess
um in here this is still hot the surface
is hot so um that would be one of my
concerns um as far as you making a
decision to get this waffle iron is
who's in your household um
because this you can it's exposed heat
exposed heat element and um you know if
you have little hands that would be
wanting to stick them their hands in
here that's not a good thing
but um we have older kids so it's not
really an
issue so we'll wait until
it uh beeps five times and tells tells
us that it's ready
okay so it is beep and has told us it
it's ready so you just grab it from this
and um kind of there kind of a failure
there okay we going to try this again is
there is steam coming out of here it's
hot so here's
your waffle
there it
is um they talk about there not being
any spills or drips to pick up but there
is up on top um it's just not around the
edges and it does U produce a lovely
looking waffle
