hey everybody welcome back to my channel
if you're new to the channel make sure
that you do subscribe but make sure you
do it the notification still so your
work when I put some videos in this
video we're going to make it chicken
salad and I'm going to be using fresh
with the sweet chicken that I bought
from the store if you can get the sales
club kind that's the best but this isn't
some stuff but it is good it's well
seasoned so when you use this to make
the chicken salad the first one we'll
cut up celery
[Music]
now I'm probably chopping celery cuz I
don't want to be too chunky so I kind of
soften Beltran
I'm gonna check it to the bowl
see that
I'm gonna use like that much I'll need a
life ally chopping - that's that much
you guys clear that buzzer and swinging
out under it get the window over like
all night it's a quick and easy recipe
doesn't take long
I got tears want to squeeze a little bit
lemon juice in to this mix here
a little bit
so I'm just gonna answer Manny's in and
I got some mail
Olive Oyl minis and then some people can
make this from scratch but I'm not gonna
do that eat in advance of
an two full swings in custom a good
little even closer so you guys busy so
this is 2 2 tbsp of the reason so I'm
explaining this to you know that works
out for pepper bring your partner a
little bit about this for sweetness so
that clearly whether they're nice and
this takes is the nonstick and I know it
makes a small batch so fizzle only you
know about people eating it's just me
I'm going in for 2 more tablespoons in
there
okay what does a man
that's the clean textures I'm looking
for so that was about 48 things with the
mom's chicken and it was 24 and a half
to the friends to eat this with toast
autumn picks the bun make a sandwich
I like eat about so sometimes it was
before and now I'm gonna go ahead and
put some student anywhere the chicken
was well seasoned it but just gonna add
some more this is onion powder some
pepper I'm gonna ask my brother don't
have the herring out so I'm gonna get
that just tastes really good
[Music]
add a tablespoon of relish okay so this
is the texture of looking forward before
this one a snail was fun
now one for a light fresh taste so you
gotta taste it you go along and see how
you would like yours but this we've done
this is something very easy to rip the
frigerator couple hours everything very
neat actually again make sure you guys
