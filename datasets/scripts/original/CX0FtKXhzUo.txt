hello welcome to DIY it is today we've
got another video for you another EOS
video and we're going to make a little
yes
snowball it's like a little elephant in
there it looks really really
cool with Glitters and everything and uh
yeah right we need a um EOS
obviously um be aware that when you're
going to use an EOS for this project you
will not
can't you you can't use the EOS for
anything else afterwards because you
have to glue it and
everything
um but that's still worth it trust
me
and yeah we've got loads more e videos
uh if you'd like to have a look on our
channel uh but this one is um yeah a
unique um project and can only be used
for this right we need a glue g we need
a little bit of water a stany knife
we've got some snow here like fake
glitter
snow you can buy these in Hobby Shop uh
hobby cof stores as well we've got a
very tiny
elephant very tiny cuz obviously it
still need to fit in the
[Music]
mold uh it could it could be a little
snowman it could be
um Santa Claus
completely up to you whatever theme
you'd like to use it
for right so you can check
here if it
fits so it's not um coming out of the
like over the the yeah over the
edge uh of the plastic
bit and yeah it's small enough so we can
definitely use it right let's
continue so we start the glue gun and
we've got a
[Music]
um yeah this is like some kind of
plastic we can place underneath just to
prevent things from um they're getting
stuck so this should
help all
right you can see the difference of the
two sides here you've got one which is
slightly deeper than the other so we lay
the deep end on the top hold
it and I'm going to place glue in
here you need to have um yeah hot enough
glue right this works better it's much
it's much
[Music]
hotter so we need quite a lot of glue
we got glitter glue as you can
[Music]
see it's very cool with
glitter so we need to cover it up all
the way
around and then we need to let it dry
right when it's all dried we have got
the plastic bit out of the
mold it was quite a quite a thing to do
so I use a knife please ask an adult to
help you with
it um yeah just to prevent your
fingers right so we got the plastic pit
out after a
[Music]
while with a little bit of force we got
it
it it's very
handy so we're going to see what we need
to do
next for our
[Music]
snowball you can use uh different tools
as well to get the plastic lid out so I
use you can use these as well these
little
clams like basically what you do you
place it on the edge like in between the
plastic bit and the actual mold and push
it
upwards that might work as well if the
knife uh if you find a knife too
dangerous cuz you have a double kind of
a double edge so I've got the stanle
knife here I've got some um yeah carton
paper underneath to protect the
table so we'll press it down it's quite
a force this as
well so if you need any help from your
parents please
ask we twist it
around and we're going
to basically cut
around to get like a nicer Edge it's a
bit annoying this job you can you might
be able to use a big file actually if
you've got one of
those
um but yeah you can do it this way as
well but please do it don't use the
knife Tor you just away from
you a bit too much
[Music]
here
Al you can place it in
there going cut it
[Music]
around you can use a scissors as
well it it's up to you if you like to uh
if you'd like to keep the Edge or
[Music]
not right after a little while all the
whole um The Edge is gone so that's
good right we've got the glue
here and want I twist around that's how
it looks still a little bit
[Music]
boring but then we're going to place the
elephant in there to yeah build it
up so we're going to add some more glue
in the
[Music]
middle then we're grabbing our little
elephant
you can wait until this is solid and
then put another layer on the top right
we're going to add some glitter oh snow
glitter
[Music]
sorry and then while the glue is still
warm we can add the little
[Music]
elephant
right now we're going to continue with
the
actual ball bit so I've got the washi
tape here and I just
lay the plastic bit in
there like a Mt to hold it uh stabilize
it then I'm going to place some water in
there not all the way not all the way
full
sorry um but yeah just on the edge just
a little bit under the edge
little bit
more I think it might be too
much all right I've got a little bit of
water took out so this is there's a
little Edge
still left right we're going to grab our
[Music]
powder
you don't want to have too much glitter
in there otherwise you might not be able
to see the elephant um anymore so a
little strip and we're going to stir it
a little bit
around again the glue gun and we're
going to go glue all the way
[Music]
around
you want quite a thick layer cuz
obviously you don't want it to um start
leaking cuz then the whole idea is is is
gone and then we're going to grab our
elephant and we're going to place
it in
there and um push it
[Music]
down
before you twist it around just make
sure you let it dry
properly right after a few minutes when
it's all
dried and here we are the little
elephant you can shake it you get a
little bit more
Glitters that looks so
cool on the edge you can see there's
still a lot of glue excess glue which
you can yeah you can uh file it away or
you can use a little
knife to uh take the excess glue
off to make it look a bit better
obviously because of the amount of glue
it will it will stay water the water
will remain in the
bubble uh yeah but I think it looks
really nice please be careful but with
um yeah the use of the sty knife right
yeah I think it's so cool we just need
to place it in the malt
[Music]
and the it and twist
it I think it's really really nice it
looks so cool well I hope you enjoyed
