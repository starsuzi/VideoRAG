who doesn't love pajama pants especially
when you're a mommy and you have a
toddler chasing you around the house so
on today's segment I'm going to show you
how to make pajama
pants you can make your own PJ pant
pattern by visiting the link above the
screen or you can use any commercial
pattern that you have
available if you're using my pattern
please add 3/4 of an inch to the waist
before cutting your fabric
let's begin with the back pieces place
right sides together and pin all along
the
crotch do the same for the front
pieces for those who are beginner sewers
a seam guide is a great tool to help you
when you're sewing on
curves remember to back stitch when you
begin and end sewing
lay the front patter piece over the back
right sides together pin at the side
seams and cell
when you're done sewing make sure to
finish the seams links for seam finishes
are linked below the video make sure the
crotch seams match before pinning down
the leg and then sew
whether you're using a commercial
pattern or the one I drafted along the
waistline the pattern piece will have a
fold line a fold line will represent the
fold that will become the Inc casement
for the waistband fold and fold over
another half an inch to finish the seam
now I will show that on the
fabric from the top Edge fold over half
an inch and then fold again along the
fold line and press
top Stitch as shown top stitching is
stitching as close to the fold as
possible leave a 2-in gap for the
waistband
insertion I'm using a non-roll elastic
waistband for the pajama pants
place the elastic waistband around your
waist for comfortable fit mark
off and then add another half an inch
for the seam
allowance if the elastic is stiff enough
you can push it through the encasement
however it's a lot easier to attach a
safety pin to the elastic and pull it
through the encasement I didn't have one
handy I'm
sorry match both ends of the elastic at
the marks pin and
sew now you can sew up the
Gap the prep work for the Hem is similar
to the encasement mark off two half inch
lines fold over twice press pin and top
Stitch and this concludes the pajama pan
segment if you have any questions
question please leave them below the
video and I will see you guys next time
