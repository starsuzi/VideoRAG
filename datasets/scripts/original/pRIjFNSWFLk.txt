I love when two animals that are not
meant to be friends become friends
[Music]
[Music]
but not just friends best friends you
know those types that spend every second
together and that is exactly what
happened in the Leningrad st. Petersburg
Zoo the oldest zoo in Russia the cat was
a homeless cat and found food in the
Linksys cage what should have been a
dangerous situation turned out beautiful
the two cats are now best friends and
inseparable the zoo actually adopted the
cats so they could be together forever
[Music]
you can see the two interacting
