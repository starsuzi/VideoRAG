hello I'm Jo and today I'm going to put
a new piece of sheet laminate on this
old countertop
o all right so first thing I want to do
is I want to prep the surface although
this surface is pretty clean it's got a
little irregular too so it's got some
old adhesive and um you know some paint
stuff from other products that we've
been doing so I'm going to go ahead and
just clean it up a little bit using this
sander
[Music]
here all right so I just finished saying
it but what I want to point out here is
we got to make sure we have a clean
surface now if you look close here
you'll see what I'm talking about
there's little bits here that um the
result from the sing a little glue Tong
and things like that want to clean all
that stuff off now what I need to do is
take some measurements to go ahead and
cut the lamb in now in this situation
what I need is I need a piece to cover
the top a piece to cover this side and
this side so I'm going to take rough
measurements I basically want to cut
pieces an inch to two in proud of the
actual countertop
surface okay so what I've done is I put
a piece of tape over the side that I'm
going to cut and this will help keep it
from chipping I'm actually going to flip
this over and cut it with a uh a rotary
saw using a fine tooth saw
blade and I'm just going to follow my
line one thing I am doing is I'm cutting
this on top of some structure in my case
I'm using a leftover drywall it will
help keep the laminate from
chipping that's
it now in my particular situation I
wasn't able to get a long enough piece
of laminate to cover this in one piece
so I had to put a seam in here so what's
the best way to do this well here's what
I'm going to do here's my full length
piece here's my extra piece again
they're both a little bit bigger than
they need to be I'm basically going to
overlap these two pieces a little bit
like
this and then I'm going to cut them
together and what that's going to do is
to give me an identical line on each
side so that way both piec will fit
exactly the easy way to do this is just
to be patient and Order along a piece of
lambin it but of course I didn't do
that so I've got the edges taped up now
what I want to do just overlap them a
hair
okay overlap takes and then I'm going to
take them together
I want to keep the seam as Square
looking as I can so I'm basically taking
a measurement from each
end Maring the same spot going to draw
my line and then cut it that way that
way our scam will look pretty square
with the existing
counter let's see how they match
up
perfect so now I want to tape the top
side getting a little Overkill with the
tape here
but I don't want this scene to budge
so Overkill if it may be
[Music]
okay now I got this coated now I going
to go ahead and coat our lamin it as
[Music]
well okay now that we get the glue on we
got to wait about 15 minutes or so let
it get kind of sticky on both sides so
we'll wait for 15 minutes then we'll put
it on what I'm going to do in the
meantime I'm going get some wood Di and
I'm going to show you how uh we want to
separate the laminate from the
countertop to place
it now we can place the laminate on top
of the
do easier when you
have some more help but trying to do it
myself so
okay so see right now it's not touching
so we are
okay so then we want to line it
up
up we got
overhang
everywhere what I'm going to do now is
start pulling the out
up I'm going to go from the
middle out
okay so we got it on there now I want to
go ahead and press it out I'm going to
roll
it not sure Tom Silva would approve of
this tool but it's a paint roller it
kind of
works okay let's see how our scam turned
[Music]
out I think that's pretty good for
SC now it's a fun part you take our
Hefty router here and we're going to cut
the excess off so we're going to use
this special uh laminate trim bit a
flush cut bit is what it's called so
it's going to guide us around our edges
and give us a nice straight cut get it
kind of square
here turn it on and let the router do
the work
[Music]
now one thing I like to do is the router
it gets it nice and flush but Edge is
kind of sharp so I just take a regular
old file like this and go and kind of
just you know file down a little bit
going never pulling back upile always St
at a slight angle to give soften the
edge and give a little bit of a bevel
[Music]
I appreciate yall watching take care I'm
Joe
