hi I'm Rachel ausis and I'm going to
show you how to clean soap scum most
often SC soap scum is going to end up on
your glass shower doors and it's so ugly
when you have glass shower doors they're
brand new they look so pretty and then
you may get this
film all over the doors well what you
want to do in this case
is lemon juice is really good at
attacking the soap
scum so put some onto a Spong
and just make sure you apply it really
well to wherever the soap scum
is if you have a scratchy sponge be
careful with the glass
obviously and just really work that
lemon juice into the soap
scum if you have cracks and crevices you
need to get into mix vinegar with baking
soda to make a paste like this
and this you can really use as like a
soft scrub type material another thing
that works
excellent if you don't feel like making
the vinegar and baking soda paste
Barkeeper's Friend it's awesome for
shower
doors it will remove
stuff you just have to make sure to
rinse it off well but soap scum water
stains and anything like that bar barush
is great for that and rust it'll work on
anything after you've done that you want
to make sure to
rinse everything off really
well you can spray vinegar and water and
wipe with a towel or paper towel so you
don't leave any
streaks and next time you take a shower
leave the shower door open this will
help prevent soap scum from building up
because it won't dry
on the shower door and such a you know
so slowly for some reason leaving the
shower door open helps prevent hard
water stains and soap scum I'm Rachel
ausis and that is how you clean soap
scum
