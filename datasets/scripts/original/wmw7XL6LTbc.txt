hi my name is leah evelay
and i am a student of adult discovery
schools of culinary arts and
i am now in i just finished my first
blog which is the foundation
and i have learned how to make the
carrots glaze and also known in french
cuisine
here's a lavish and what i have here is
carrots and i will cut this up in a
uniform
cut i have also a
butter that's what i'm going to use to
saute the carrots
i have salt and pepper just to season in
the end
and also parsley probably i will use a
tablespoon or so to garnish on the end
and so here and also i have
a chicken stock or you may use also
water
and sparkling water as well another
component that i would like to
share with you is usually the recipe
you can put honey or sugar and for me
i'd like to just kind of extract the
sweetness the natural sweetness of the
carrots
and that um you know sauteing that it's
kind of caramelized
the carrots and it just gives it just
more flavor to it
and so um i will just cut about
about two inches long here with a carrot
i'm gonna make it a vlog
and this is like a button it cut
in in my foundations
you can also uh
julienne you can cut julian as well you
can cut rounds as
you wish so it would be up to you and i
already have some in here uh cut
carrots and i will go ahead and show you
i will saute that in a in a pan so
just come follow me
okay what i'm doing is melting
the butter i have about
a tablespoon
i'll take that up
just want to make sure that the butter
is all melted
from here i will add the
cat's carrots
and just enough that is a single layer
so it will cook evenly
you can put your
medium high to high heat
and what i have here is a chicken stock
so
i will just cover the carrots with stuff
just enough to
cover them
and you just let it cook until it's
tender
and also all the liquid has been
evaporated
to caramelize the carrots
and this would probably take about you
know seven minutes or so
as you see now it is starting to
caramelize
and pretty much about
what about half of the liquid have
evaporated so
it's gonna be just few more minutes
as you see oh uh pretty much the
liquid has been evaporated and the
carrot has been caramelized and what we
have is uh
the butter
now that the carrot is is cooked and
caramelized
um what i will do is i will add in about
a tablespoon of chopped
fine i'll just add it this is just for
the last minute
just garnish
you did not see that one
all right
and this is the finished product
for the glazed carrots
it looks wonderful and healthy and
it is nutritious as well until next time
um just stay with me and
i'll show you another recipe that is
fabulous
thank you
you
