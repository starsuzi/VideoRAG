well Jake I've never seen this before
what's going on well yesterday this hen
she's been pecked in the past and she
was hiding and her um her vent which is
her bum was it was covered in runny
stool and some blood too so I've
separated her and I think the first step
in treating it is giving her a nice bath
to clean everything up and it makes her
quite relaxed as well I'm surprised that
a chicken would take a bath so
calmly well actually like
it apparently I mean you had you don't
even necessarily need to hold her there
right wow I just somehow thought that
she wouldn't like this
but so she was pretty uh encrusted on
the the hind end yes but now it's all
better I trimmed the feathers back a bit
first but
can we take a look or would that be too
distressing for her that might be a
little too distressing I think we'll
just so you've got there's a little soap
in that water was there or was it just
plain water soap okay let's
see I think that it feels nice to my
hand so it's probably going to be okay
just a second here
let's Jee now it's pretty cold outside
it's just a little bit above freezing
yeah I'm think what are you going to do
to dry her off cuz you can't put her
back she stay in here for a while I had
a little idea I think maybe I've heard
people blow drying those chicken do you
think maybe a heat gun on a low setting
he heat gun's pretty hot even on a low
setting and the noise would scare her
too try it though cuz I think you should
just just put her in overnight in these
crates over here one on top of the other
yeah I don't know they're dry
naturally can we just see how clean
she's gotten
here
that used to be all encrusted oh yeah
that looks a lot better you think she's
so you said she was bleeding yeah I'm
not sure what's going on but didn't you
mention something about her being a
young hen and maybe starting to lay
sooner she should productive breed I
think she might have started laying a
bit too soon for her
size cuz she is smaller than the other
legghorns we have right
yeah hm well a chicken taking a bath
from our future vet Dr
Jake the feathers hold a lot of water
it's just like washing a Shaggy
Dog
