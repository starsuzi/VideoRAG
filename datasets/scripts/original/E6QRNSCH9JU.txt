Thanks audible for sponsoring my video and allowing you to make better videos for you guys
So today we're continuing with a hard time story where I'm exploring recipes and food that was created during times of food scarcity.
So if you missed my last video where I cooked a steak made out of grapefruit peel
I'll put the link up there and down below
So in that video many of you commented about Clara and her Channel Great Depression cooking, which I hadn't visited in a long time
So thank you so much for reminding me of that Clara and I went and binge watched a lot of her recipes where she shares
stories of her family and herself growing up during the Great Depression
What her family and her mother had to do to provide food for everyone during that time where there wasn't any food?
- one of those recipes that she included was dandelion salad
So sadly Clara has since passed but this video is dedicated to her and her resilience and resourcefulness
So let's go outside and pick some dandelions.  Here
we are at the second week of May and I'm in my backyard
so I know that these dandelions are going to be pesticide free because we do not spray the
Dandelions as you can see they're everywhere. This is not the peak season for dandelions
you can see that many of them have gone to seed which is just fine with us because
we don't spray for them because I have bees there is my recent split and there is my original hive and
Dandelions are an important source for bees for both pollen and nectar
It's an early source
Bees depend on it. It's also worth noting that dandelions were actually considered an important green
They were planted instead of like planting grass. It's just until recent times that they been
Labeled the scourge of you know, the suburban lawn, which isn't it really true. They're lovely. They're a beautiful flower
They're actually related to sunflowers and they're lovely. Look at those beautiful dandelions.
Claire says just use a knife go around the base of the dandelion and pull em' up.
Just cut em out
I'm going to cut as much of the dirt off here as possible clean them up outside
Put em in my bowl
 
So now I'm back in.  Here are the dandelions, freshly-picked I also started picking some dandelion heads
I'm gonna see how many I can collect and hopefully I'll have enough to make some wine
So I'm going to wash them in some water Clara washes them at least three times in cold water
So what she did in her video is she just pulled off these dead leaves?
Here and she trimmed off the ends and
All of the dandelion is completely edible including the stalks and the flowers, but for the salad we're just looking for the greens
So so I've had dandelion greens before but I saute them with a little bit of olive oil and garlic
This will be the first time I've had them raw
So Clara actually shares a very sweet story of when she would come back from working her job at the hostess bakery plant
And she would carry a knife with her so she could pick dandelions on her way home and bring them home to her mother
It's so sweet. All right, so we're gonna pick out as much grass and you know all summer
mossy nonsense I
Would normally be doing this in a sink, but since we're doing it on camera,  I'm just using large bowls and water
So while I'm washing my greens
Let me tell you a little bit that audible so at audible
You can find audio books original audio stories comedy news and much much more
So right now I'm currently listening to a square meal written by James Engelmann and Andrew Koh
so basically
It puts the Great Depression into a historical context providing
Anecdotal stories of people who actually were going through the Great Depression and the policy matters of how the US has tried to ensure people
Had enough in nutrition very interesting book and what I love about audiobooks is that I can listen to them whenever I want
While, I'm cooking dinner while I'm in the car
I can just pause and restart whenever I want and then I can get something else done at the same time

All right, big thanks
audible for supporting my channel. All right. So here are my dandelion greens. I'm gonna dry them off onto this
Dish cloth here
And I'm gonna dry most of the water off in a flower sack towel
And you spin it but you do it outside because now I have water all over my kitchen and that works amazingly. look the flower sack
Towels all wet on the bottom
Alright look and it gets them pretty dry
Wow
Lovely right
alrighty next I have a lemon and Clara recommends to roll them very smartly so you can get
All the juice out cut
the lemon in half
OOP I guess my knife was dirty
It's ok that's organic I'll use my fingers to strain out any seeds
So that's probably about a tablespoon of lemon juice and now I'm just gonna add olive oil
And that's probably about 2 tablespoons of olive oil now just add a bit of salt and pepper
So I'm gonna whisk this up a little bit now, I'm gonna add my greens
What
I found very charming as Clara says just to use your hands to mix the salad
So the best so my hands are nice and clean. I'm just gonna just toss my salad. Oh
It smells so good now I'm gonna need some tongs . I just washed
my hands
All right, let's give my beautiful salad a taste it looks gorgeous to Clara at the ducky mouth
mmhmm
And that's great
Fresh crisp green nice bitterness kind of reminds me of arugula a bit
It's not as peppery as arugula, but it definitely has a bitterness to it
I think the earlier you picked the dandelions the less bitter they'll be this is later in the season
So these do definitely have some bitterness to them, but I actually quite like that
It reminds me the fact that I'm eating dandelions and I think bitter foods are something that we don't taste a lot of these days
Definitely a lot of salt definitely a lot of sugar but not enough bitterness. I think it's really good for you
I think as a tonic herb and just good for exercising your taste buds, right?
Delish so
There you have it Clara's
dandelion salad
So the next time you see a patch of dandelions consider making it yourself.
Just make sure the area has not been sprayed;
it's not in a highly trafficked area;
you don't want lots of pet traffic, or exhaust traffic or anything that will potentially pollute your food.
