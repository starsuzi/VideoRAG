hey guys Matt here just wanted to show
you couple of my trees here this is a
Pon
pecan that's about 15 years old we
grafted it from just planted a native
tree here and then when it got big
enough my dad grafted it to
Pony uh s
wood as you can see this
year it is loaded it's September
17th 2016
and some of them are getting ready to
pop open I don't know if you can see
that from the shadow
there they are
just starting to kind of open up a
little
bit you know a lot of people sayd
wait till after the first good Frost see
there's one
there to pick them
but down here in Texas if you wait that
long you going to have problems with
crows all kinds of varmints getting them
so when they start opening I start
picking them
up now I do let them follow the ground
mostly unless the husks are real dry and
the uh con still hasn't fallen out
sometimes it gets hung up in the husk I
will uh pick them directly from the tree
if I can reach them or I'll take a stick
or something and
R over the branches a little bit and
make them
fall as you can
see those right there are still closed
pretty tight this one right
here is getting
close excuse me the Ragweed is also bad
here and so is my
allergies goodness as you can see this
tree is loaded this
year lots of nice pwy paper sh cons on
this
tree again this tree is about 15 years
old and was growing from root stop that
we
grafted on
to I don't think I'm going to stop
sneezing
so there have you
folks here's another tree that we
grafted again it's a Pon
e same situation as the last one that I
showed
you
it is getting ready to start dropping
its peans as well
ponan is known for its excellent nut to
Kernel Ratio or kernel to husk or shell
ratio basically meaning you get a lot of
pecan and very little
shell very well suited for the climate
here in Texas this tree here has had no
supplemental water other than what
Mother Nature has given
it throughout the years and it
thrives this tree here it's a little
older
tree it started out as a double graft
onto a very large root stock there a
native tree that was growing here when I
built the
house is not as loaded this year year
last year it was it was very well
loaded had lots of
nuts I've also noticed that this
one tends to drop
earlier you can
see there's somec already on the ground
and it's mid-september need to get out
here and pick these up for the squirrels
get
them all right guys see there's where
the graph uh
Union is right
there this tree was grafted when we
built a house back in
99 so it's a little bit older
tree thanks
guys
