hello everybody i'm harold with nature's
friends and this is my friend jess with
urban art and today we're going to show
you how we pickle our okra
this is one of our favorites
so you've been anticipating making this
video for a while right okay um
everything here is from your garden
planted this spring
yeah
we have okra right here um a couple
heads of garlic and two peppers one is
jalapeno and one's a little cayenne so
it's got a little bit of a kick to that
does it america okay cool and our fresh
dill we like it very dilly
so we're gonna put our peppers in
put our two cloves of garlic
this is a one pint jar right one pint
cool and you just kind of shove it in
there
sometimes we put carrots in it can i try
and help yourself cool
we love this with the
cheese
crackers cheese and crackers
i still have a can in my fridge from
last year's
it's just so good
just goes good with anything as a side
cheesy cracker sounds good i've never
tried that before i'm liking all my
tacos
tacos no that's a good idea that's a
really good idea
that one ain't gonna fit
this extra one okay
now so we got it in the jar and that's
what it looks like
now we're gonna put our mixture with it
what's the mixture exactly
it's two cups of water
two cups of vinegar and a tablespoon of
salt
heated okay heat it we warm it up on the
stove
pour it right in there half inch from
the top
and what's left over we put it in a pint
jar quart jar whatever how much you got
left put it in the refrigerator and the
next time you do one jar or two jars you
just use that instead of making another
batch wow
that's a really clever idea this isn't
your first rodeo is it harold
we got our warm lid
that keeps everything tight now don't
you have to put it in a bath i'm gonna
put it in a hot water bag
cool
this is a
broccoli
asparagus steamer
it works great for one jar of
okra
we're going to turn it on
what what now what's your setting there
we're going to boil it on high for 10
minutes and then we'll take it out and
let you see what it looks like with
finished product
cool okay everybody
it's been boiling for 10 minutes
these little handy dandy little handy
dandy i was going to ask you how are you
going to do that
did we walk across
maybe that towel please yes sir
can we set it down
we let it set
and this top will go down it'll seal
you can see how pretty it looks don't
you wait for a little pop
it'll pop and then that's how you know
when it's ready right oh cool
and then
it will be ready to eat in about
how long do i have to wait
about a month is good i'm not all the
flavors get that's perfect for fall
you know
then we'll be making it all summer long
as it comes in
chilly
