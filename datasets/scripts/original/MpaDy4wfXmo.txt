hey guys the wife here and today we are
going to be making a diy fabric softener
i got the recipe off of pinterest and
you'll find the link for the website
right below here
and it involves three ingredients we're
going to use some distilled white
vinegar
some hair conditioner
and some water we're going to mix it all
together and then we're going to put it
into some empty containers
the recipe that we're following calls
for 3 cups of vinegar
16 ounces or 2 cups of hair conditioner
and we picked out a flavor of refreshing
waterfall we figured our clothes would
be better smelling like a waterfall
instead of strawberries
and six cups of hot water
the first thing that we're going to do
is mix our hair conditioner
with water so i'm going to pour this
hair conditioner into this old
picture that we got at a garage sale for
about 10 cents we have no intention of
using it for anything that we're
drinking but it's good for mixing stuff
so let's get this mixed in here
i'm gonna get as much out as we can
and then i'm gonna use a little bit of
the water that we need from our recipe
to get the rest of it out
i'm going to take a little bit of the
water that i have measured out and pour
it into
this fat at this conditioner bottle and
i'm using a funnel to make sure the
water gets into there to get all the
last remnants of the conditioner out of
the bottle
we put the lid back on to the
conditioner bottle with a little bit of
water in there we're shaking it up uh-oh
and we're spilling it
to make sure that we get every last bit
of conditioner
i'm also going to add in one ounce more
of conditioner from another bottle
because there was only 15 ounces in our
last bottle and the recipe called for 16
ounces
i took the lid back off of the
conditioner bottle and now i'm pouring
the water into the pitcher
and i'm going to pour the rest of the
hot water into the pitcher as well
and then i'm going to stir it up really
good so it doesn't look like there's
chunks of hair conditioner in the water
now i am stirring in three cups of
distilled white vinegar
after this gets stirred up real well
we're going to be ready to pour it into
empty containers for use in our laundry
room
our last step in making our fabric
softener is to pour what we've made into
containers that we have been
saving up to
use and make this fabric softener with
that seems pretty full
here is our finished product of our diy
fabric softener
these bottles hold a total of about 100
ounces our recipe made 88 ounces so one
bottle is filled completely up and the
other bottle is filled right about here
part of the fun of making this diy
fabric softener project was figuring out
how much money we're saving by making
our own fabric softener because i am a
bargain hunter
the two bottles of conditioner that we
used
cost 1.88
which comes out to one dollar for what
we used
and the vinegar
we purchased cost 2.38
which came out to 45 cents
for the part that we used
the recipe calls for two tablespoons of
the fabric softener to be used per load
that comes out to one ounce and we made
88 ounces so it will cost you
1.6 cents per ounce to use this fabric
softener
