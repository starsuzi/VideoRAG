g'day all brother blonde
welcome back to the kitchen once again
you know
there's three things that i think are
absolutely beautiful when combined
together
garlic onion
and prawns or some people call shrimp
in australia we call them prawns shrimp
are tiny little
wee little things anyway but of course
one of the problems with
that three combination thing is
apart from the beautiful taste is the
smell have you ever had that problem
the garlic the onion the prawn smell so
what i want to do today is
give you the worst example of how to
catch garlic
that you've ever seen i'm going to chop
some garlic chop some onion
bung them in with the prawns and show
you the quick and easy way
to get rid of that horrible smell
going to mix them all together
and then we're going to get our
nine-year-old
daughter whose birthday it was yesterday
to come and smell daddy's hands
gonna come in you smell it
oh it's worse than a breath worsen my
breath
okay thanks off you go
now oh
okay the good thing is it smells it
smells worse than it tastes yeah all
right now
most of you are going to have this at
home if you don't well
there's another way around it but you
can buy all these different fancy things
in fact
one thing you can buy is one of these
things now that is a
stainless steel piece of soap and that
works well
but if you don't have one of those i'm
sure you've got one of these
and that is a stainless steel sink
so all you need to do wet your hands
rub them along the sink
like that
and as the french say
voila that's it that's as simple as that
just rub your hands on something
stainless steel
it even works on these things as well so
if you want to just rub that sideways
just like this
give it away try not to blunt in the
blade
trying to cut your nose off while you're
sniffing it
and there you go how easy is that now in
our next lesson
lesson that's not the right word in our
next video
we're going to cook these so stay tuned
for the next one
see ya now how's it smell
your hands smell good but your breath
still stinks
oh thanks
