Today we're going to be mixing Ice Resin and
using resin molds.
We're also going to mixing some dyes as well to
color that resin. So first assemble all your materials.
You've got your Ice Resin which comes in
part A and part B.
Also in this kit are handy little measuring cups.
It's nice because they actually have measurements
right on the inside.
You're also provided with some little stir sticks
as well.
We have wide of selection of molds. We little
hearts, we have circles, we have rectangles.
There's many more shapes including eggs and
triangles, bangle bracelets.
All sorts of fun things you can play with.
So what I did I cleaned these molds. I went ahead
and washed them.
I didn't use soap, I went ahead and used some warm
water and then I dryad them with a clean cloth.
I didn't want to use a paper towel because I don't
want any fibers getting into the mold.
Because whatever is in the mold when you pour 
the resin is gonna stay in there.
So you want to make sure they're dust free and properly
cleaned.
I also went ahead and i sprayed them with Mold
Release. This is this something we sell here at
www.beadaholique.com as well.
That's just going to help your resin come out
of the mold
once it's fully cured.
Just a couple squirts in each mold holding
the
mold release about ten inches away and then
I just let it dry.
So we'll come back to those in just a moment
but first off we're gonna go ahead and mix
our resin.
It's one part to one part, so I'm going to start.
I'm going to do a little bigger batch so I'm using a bigger
cup. We sell these cups here as well and they
have the measurements on them as well.
I'm going to start with my part A which is my actual
resin.
I think for todays projects I want about
a total of three ounces.
So I'm going to do an ounce and a half of
part A.
And just pour it really slow.
Now I'm going to add my part B which is my hardener.
I'm going to go then
right up to my three ounce line.
What's nice about Ice Resin is you have a little
time to play with it.
So you're not having to work quite as quickly as
other resins.
It's really important that your measurements are
exact.
Now I'm going to take my stir stick
and I'm going to start stirring it together.
I'm going to be doing this for two minutes.
Now a little tip with the bubbles I'm going
to let it sit
for about five minutes.
And I did forget to mention when we started
that before we poured our resin I did let
part A which is the actual resin warm up
for about forty minutes in a pan of
warm tap water. You don't want it to be hot
by any means but you definitely want it to be
warm.
That's going to help to reduce your bubbles
as well.
This is now set up for about five minutes and
so what I want to do is a couple different
things today.
I want to add some dye to it. Actually a couple different
colors to it and I just what to have some clear
as well.
So I've taken taken several little cups and I'm
going to add
some of my mixture
to these now.
They don't have to be so exact on this one because
it's already mixed together.
I'm going to take two
new clean stir sticks
and I'm going to add some color.
I have
casting craft transparent resin dye so
this is going to be for my green.
It's nice 'cause they have a very small little
hole at the top.
You're just going to do one drop at a time.
So I'm going to put that one drop in.
Stir it up.
I want it to be a little bit darker so I'm going to
put another drop in.
Stir that up.
Let's try one more
drop and then that's gonna be about it. I
don't really want to change the property
of my resin mixture.
Keep stirring that until all striations are gone.
Otherwise it's going to have a modeled effect which could
be really cool but for what I'm going to do i don't
really want that.
Now I'm going to try to make some pink.
Because in a minute I'm going to have some great little heart
shaped molds I want to use.
When you're mixing dyes remember
a little goes a long ways
especially with colors like red.
First I want to see what that's going to look like
for me.
And that is red.
So I'm going to add some white to tame that down.
Maybe one more little drop of white.
Okay. Those are all stirred.
I also pulled out some little findings.
I have a little charm, I have a little bead,
I've got some filigree.
I'm going to put those into my molds as soon as
I pour them.
Here are my various shaped molds. I'm going to do
a couple that is just clear.
I just wanna very very carefully
pour just a little bit in.
I'm going to go over here and do the same for some
of my rectangles.
It's going to spread out for you on it's own.
If you do you have a piece where you really
want to get into the corners you can always
take your stir stick
kind of help work it into the corners.
Make sure always doing it on a flat surface otherwise
your resin is going to
dry on an angle
which for obvious reasons you do not want.
Now remember how your resin pieces are going to
pop out of the mold, so what the under side
is, it's actually going to be the top. So instead
of putting
the flower down like this, I'm going to turn it upside
down.
You can use a pair of tweezers too, that maybe a little
bit easier.
I'm going to let him drop in there.
I liked this ring, so I'm going to go ahead and put
it in there.
Just use the stick to move it around.
I'm going to drop this down in there as well.
It kind of ended up falling in there a little bit
but I can just move it around with my stick.
I'm going to let it go down there.
And now I am going to wait for these to dry
for approximately twenty four hours
before I attempt my next layer on them.
It's been twenty-four hours and we've let
our resin cure in our resin molds.
It's hard to the touch now.
You can see added some different filigree
pieces, a brass stamping, this here
is an image transfer,
I actually used stamps on this one. Just a
whole lot of different experimentation here.
Anything you want to put into the
resin and you can.
Now I'm going to pour another layer of resin
over the top
of this hardened layer.
I'm using the same ice resin that I used
before.
I'm just slowly filling my
molds.
Now if i wanted to do a third layer on
any of these, I would not fill the mold to
the top.
It's been three days and we have our resin which
is now fully cured within our molds.
So now we need to remove
the objects from the molds.
We do this just by turning the mold over,
taking our fingers,
gently
pressing at the mold
and popping out our pieces.
And there you have a finished piece.
