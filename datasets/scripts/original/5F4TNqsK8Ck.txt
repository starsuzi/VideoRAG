hello YouTube Mr tpd 05 coming at you
with a new
video this is going to be an
experimental video about how to restore
cast iron though um I've seen some vids
out there uh Beast did an incredible job
doing multiple variables multiple
products I am just going to go one
variable one variable only and I'm going
straight for apple cider vinegar so I
have a dutch oven that I am going to try
to
restore so I am going to show you the
Dutch oven here in a second but I have
uh two 1G jugs of Great Value apple
cider apple cider vinegar at
5% and also another uh 32 fluid ounces
of apple cider vinegar from hind it's 5%
there has been no no cleaning of this
whatsoever here is the
inside I'm not going to even clean it
out I went to the local hardware shop uh
yesterday and picked up these two wire
cut brushes one is a uh a coarse and the
other is a fine I'm just buying these um
because I'm expecting to probably need
to use them to further clean this up
during uh the process you can see it
is Tuesday the
10th start pouring
in the rest of the apple cider vinegar
that I
have okay I have my entire Dutch oven
submerged in apple cider vinegar the lid
is flipped upside down and it's
separated just by some tin foil between
the bottom and the top this is actually
about 6 hours after I put this
in and you can
see considerable amount of activity
going
on you can see the
bubbling all
over okay day
two
about 29 hours
later um this thing has been
increasingly leaking uh out of the
styrofoam I really didn't think apple
cider vinegar would eat
through styrofoam but obviously it is
off the lid
here and it's done a lot of work but you
can see I've lost
some now I am going to transfer it into
a plastic
container uh lined with a trash
bag okay here is the Omaha steak
styrofoam cooler that's been failing me
uh somehow this apple cider vinegar is
eating through at
some uh continued expedited rate so I'm
going to transfer into this
plastic uh container and line it with a
with a
Wednesday the 11th the bottom there
about
4:45 that is about 29 hours after uh I
first put it in and you can see it is a
Mucky mess in
there I'm going to take the lid out here
first to see what it looks like
obviously I going to take a wire brush
to it and
see what that turns into okay I just
pulled this out of
the
solution of apple cider vinegar
and I'm getting ready to clean the uh
the base and handle of it just got
finished you can see how Rusty it is to
the to the naked eye here at the moment
but I do feel a little bit better about
what's going on here cuz I use this wire
brush in the
drill pretty you know just Softly on it
and uh just finished up doing the
lid and you can
see just a little bit discolored
I haven't really cleaned it or anything
and just a little bit
of tad bit of rust and some
corners but now you can clearly read the
10 and
A4 and the eight there I cleaned the lid
looking really good I don't have a
proper brush to really good underneath
the
handle this has been sitting actually in
the vinegar solution since I was
cleaning that and it's actually even
gotten cleaner so since I think so much
more of the metal is exposed so I am
going to set that in there for now
again and here
is the
pot and I mean it's just stained no
noticeable much rust again I don't have
a great brush to get underneath there
but uh you know staining to where it was
cooking before
obviously uh but looking pretty
impressive after about 30 hours I wind
up using uh a barbecue brush as well and
uh I'm going to let these two soak
overnight in vinegar and uh go at it
again I I do know that if I since I let
this uh Bowl sit out for about 15
minutes I was doing something else we
lost power of the house
briefly um that rust started showing you
know the surface rust start once it
started drying so I know it's not there
yet 7:45
a.m. and that is about 46
hours after I started the
project came out this morning
and got my
rinse right here ready and that is what
I walked out to a lot more bubbled up
rust I think we're uh we're ready to do
a little cleaning with a little SOS pad
just to kind of finally tune this thing
and then see what we
got
little bit better after not touching it
just purely in the apple cider vinegar
but I would assume it's going to clean
up even a lot nicer after the SOS pad
you can see I don't
see any rust in the
inside all right I'm going to SOS pad it
and then uh see what we got and all
right after uh cleaning with the SOS pad
things cleaned up uh even better than
than before um I let them sit out for a
little while and surface rust started to
emerge again it's Thursday the
12th 10:05 at
night
and I didn't think I was going to have a
whole lot of activity
left but hey
ascar hey buddy what do you think about
this
project here is what's been going on
today Friday the
13th 9:05
a.m. considerable amount of more
activity it was bubbled up overnight I
got the Rin bucket ready
here and I going to see how this is
looking and see if we can see any
difference
barring some carbon dark
spots I do not see one bit of rust
so I think we're about there ready to do
a final cleaning and maybe bake it today
she's going to clean up
beautiful here is the pot ready to go
into the oven the lid is already in the
oven it's covered with vegetable
shortening going in at 325 for about 2
hours Saturday May
14th fifth day of the project and it is
I'm proud to say complete it's too hot
to the touch
at the moment but it's been seasoned
three times in the oven with vegetable
shortening uh for about an hour and a
half each time at uh variable different
temperatures that's it thanks for
watching and uh it's a good experiment
