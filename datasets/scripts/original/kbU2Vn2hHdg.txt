hi my name is christina govinda with
domesticalistic.com and today we're
going to talk about how to make the tool
on a tutu straight
when working with tool it can be really
easy to get it uneven and disheveled
this is an easy fix though when our tool
isn't straight across all we need to do
is use scissors to cut it since tulle
doesn't need to be hemmed so i'm going
to make sure
that i have straightened
the skirt out
and then i'm going to take my scissors
and cut to the shortest length
straightening the tool is as simple as
that thanks so much for watching my name
is christina and today we talked about
how to straighten the tool on your tutu
you
