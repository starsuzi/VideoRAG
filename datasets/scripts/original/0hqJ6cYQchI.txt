hi guys this is miso here with miso
making it welcome to my kitchen and
today we're going to be making hot water
corn bread this delicious dish is
originally the journey cake from England
where English men took it on Long
Journeys with them but regionally it's
known as hot water cornbread con corn
phone Ash cake hul cake mush bread
Junkin cake and Johnny Cake this is not
to be mistaken with the Caribbean Johnny
Cake which is made from flour this hot
water cornbread is going to be made from
cornmeal and hot water with just a very
few other
ingredients but here we have this is
just a half a cup of seizing flour and
we have 1 and 1/2 cups of
cornmeal and we have here 2 tbspoon of
sugar I have on already
boiling uh some hot water and I don't
know how much hot water I'm going to use
this is this is something you're going
to have to just play by ear and I'll
show you the consistency that we're
looking for but I don't know exactly how
much water it's going to
[Music]
be so here we're going to go ahead and
we're going to get in our cornmeal that
again is 1 and 1/2 cups of
cornmeal I'm going to put in my 1/2 cup
of
flour and this is my two tablespoons of
sugar I'm going to go ahead and get that
right
in let me just stir that up a little
bit get it all sort of mixed
together and I'm going to get ready to
get my um oh one other thing I forgot
guys in here you want to put excuse me
in here you want to
put about a
tablespoon of oil
it's going to be about a
tablespoon okay and
also we want to
add about a e/ of a
teaspoon of
salt that's it let me get my water up to
boil and then we'll come back and get it
together guys let's go ahead and begin
to get our hot water in and as I said I
can't really measure it but this is a
half this is a half a cup measuring cup
and I'm going to just start off by
putting the hot water in this half2 cup
while that's hot I going to just start
off by putting that hot water in the
half2 cup measure and getting that in
and just beginning to stir
it okay so we're going to need more than
that certainly so let me put a little
bit more of the hot boiling water in
there
okay that's coming good let me put a
little bit more of that boiling water in
that was the
entire half2
cup we're going to need just a little
bit more let's see if you can see down
in here this is thick but we don't want
it quite so thick so let's just get a
little bit
more of that boiling
water
[Music]
here I just have a bowl with some cool
water in it and I'm just going to use it
to just to make sure that my hands
are moistened so I'm going to get some
of this
mixture and I am going to just press it
out really really
thin
