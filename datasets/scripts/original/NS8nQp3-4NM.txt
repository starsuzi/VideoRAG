man so if you're in my situation then
you've just maybe you've discovered this
is a really nice finish look right
you've got a nice three-sided square
piece of stainless steel but you don't
have enough in order to make the run all
the way up to the hole so if you find
yourself in that situation um you can do
what I'm doing we're going
to so there's the top piece but it still
left about a 6 in gap so I went to the
local hardware store and I bought a
piece of believe this was 12 by like
36 in um know whatever it's called
sheet aluminum
stuff um and it comes as an L so it
comes looking like you've got this and
then A straight piece um so here's what
I did I laid this L piece inside the old
piece of flu took my tin snips and just
scored the edge of it just to give it a
little bit of a Mark um actually you can
see that I've experimented with this a
little bit I had to make a couple
marks um so did that on either side made
a little
Mark
then I got a just a piece of wood with a
hard Edge on it all right put the board
over the at that point this was the flat
side of metal so put that board along
where where my two marks
were so I kind of placed it in there
then I just kind of started pulling up
on this piece till it Formed um like a
45° angle kind of thing then took a
rubber
mallet stepped on the board so now I've
got this nice straight edge to beat
against and I just started
wailing away at
this and that gives it a nice
90° uh finished Edge it does put a
couple like waves along that corner so
I'm not quite sure how to do it without
that if you think of a way to do that
comment below I'd love to hear your
method but that gives you a nice um U
shape u channel that you can use so
regardless of application if there's a
wall here or whatever now you have a
nice U shape and you can use that as a
nice finished looking product I'll post
a picture of the finished product after
this so there you go that's how to
create a custom flu piece for your range
