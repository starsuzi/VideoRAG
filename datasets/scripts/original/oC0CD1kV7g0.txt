- Welcome to Good Mythical More.
- Comment Takeover.
This is when we send you to
a relatively undiscovered
video and have you comment on it.
We're sending you to
Waffles Has A Bite To Eat.
(relaxed EDM music)
Comment with the next EDM
track Waffles should jam to.
- Don't tell them we sent
you, just be very nice.
(humming)
- I liked this.
- Had a lot of fun with Mayim.
- Those Mentos, remember
Mentos and Diet Coke guys?
- Yeah.
- Wonder what they're up to.
- I don't know, let's contact them.
Let's contact the Mentos guys.
- They wore lab coats all the time.
- They did this, what
we're doing right now.
- Weren't this cool, though, look at that.
- Got a little, got a little.
(laughing awkwardly)
- What if that was the
only way that I laughed?
Every time I laugh, no matter how, just
(laughing awkwardly)
- We're gonna do an experiment
where we blow your minds
while blowing up a balloon.
- Would you like me less?
- I have a, yes, I haven't--
- Would you still be my friend?
- Haven't done this before, but we have
instructions on how to do
it and we're not stupid.
- Nah, don't follow the instructions.
Instructions are for losers.
- All right, so in this
bottle, we have vinegar.
In this bottle, we have nothing.
In this cup, I have a
spoon, we have a funnel,
(trumpets)
and then we have another funnel
(trumpets)
two funnels together,
(trumpets)
and then we have a balloon.
- I call those bugles.
- Butles?
- Bugles.
- Bugles.
- Can you pour some baking soda?
Actually, what we were told ahead of time
is that we should use a
half a cup of vinegar per.
- With a ratio of one spoonful?
- So lets, you know what?
Let's elevate that a little bit.
Okay.
- To what?
- Go to, I'd go, let's go 3/4,
not quite double the recipe.
- Tell me when, because
I don't look at numbers.
- Stop.
- Mine's a little bit more than that.
- Mine's about 2/3.
(laughing awkwardly)
- The Count does that, man, Count Chocula,
and the count from Sesame Street,
which is a different count.
How many counts are there?
Let's count the counts.
There's Count Chocula, there's
The Count from Sesame Street,
and there's
Count Dracula, the original.
- Count of Monte Crisco.
(crew laughs)
- Count of Monte Crisco.
- I said "Crisco."
- Any other counts, guys, come on.
- Uh, Count, what?
- [Both] Count Basie?
- Yeah.
- Is that a rapper?
- Jazz legend.
Oh, look at how slowly mine, you can't,
you can't keep the air out.
Count Basie's a good one.
Who was that, Alex?
- He's a big jazz man.
- Are a jazz aficionado?
- [Alex] Yes.
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Still pouring the vinegar.
- Now the fun part happens.
- That was pretty fun.
Any time I use a funnel, it's fun.
- Uh so.
- That's why they call them funnels.
- You're supposed to do
just a flat one of these,
but let's do two.
- Okay.
- It could be a similar situation to when
Kevin told us the wrong measurements
for the brake fluid and hydraulic.
- Told us the wrong measurements
then he took a vacation
for us to do the thing, he wasn't there.
Oh no, Chase, that's what it was.
- Chase did it and then Kevin
took over and he was like--
- Chase told Kevin, then Chase left.
- The last thing Kevin said to me was
"Chase said to do this much,
"but you could probably do a little more."
(crew laughs)
I mean, surprised we're still here.
- I got a funnel full of baking soda, man.
When's the last time you
brushed your teeth with baking soda?
- This morning, that's all I use.
I don't believe in toothpaste.
That's a government
conspiracy, they use it
to take over your brain.
You remember swish?
- You know, you really
side-stepped a trap there,
did you know that, what was happening?
I was trying to frame you.
If you said "I can't remember"
I'd be like "I can tell," but instead,
you went straight to the jugular.
- Do you remember the swish?
Did you guys have to swish in school?
Like once a year, they'd
break something out
and make you swish.
- Everybody in the
classroom had to take a cup,
take it in their mouth and swish
and they would do a count-down
for like 30 seconds.
- I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
but there is no way that
was not a conspiracy.
There's no way that swishing once a year
did anything for the kids.
I've had two theories, theory number one--
- I hadn't thought
about it, that is crazy.
- Theory number one is that it was a thing
that teachers always had and if one kid
had super stink breath that day,
she said "swish day" and she did it
so it covered everybody's breath
and it got the one person
who had stink breath.
That's my first theory.
- But the swish was, it
was a fluoride treatment,
so the reason why you're wrong is because.
- Well the second theory is that it's
a government conspiracy and
they were mind controlling us.
- You don't need to take
a fluoride treatment
more than once a year at the dentist.
- You sure it wasn't mind control?
- So what you do is you
put the balloon over there
and let that dangle.
- And then you just--
- You pick this up and once
you dump the baking soda
into the vinegar, it creates magic
which then blows up the balloon.
- Make sure that you
get all that in there,
so ready, three, hey, first
of all, just so you know,
it came with a certain suggestion as to
what the measurements should be,
we've almost doubled that.
- Do you wanna put on goggles?
- No.
- Let's put on goggles.
- Goggles, what about, we're
protecting the microphone
and the cameras,
should have thought about that.
- Hey man.
You gotta protect the irreplaceables.
(laughing awkwardly)
- Ready?
- [Both] Three, two, one.
- Oh gosh.
- What?
What, it's, it's boiling, it's boiling.
It's magicking.
- We coulda gone bigger, man.
- Look, it's going inside of the,
it's foamenting inside of the--
- It's foamenting?
- Inside the balloon itself.
- All right, when do they fly away?
Isn't that what happens now?
- All right, and that was the magic part,
and now the boring part.
- Isn't science fun, kids?
- Where we just sit here and look at it.
