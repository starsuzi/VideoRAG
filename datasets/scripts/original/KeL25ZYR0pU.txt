How to Make Rolled Fondant Icing.
Fondant is a smooth, sugary icing that gives
cakes and cookies a flawless finish.
You will need 1/8 c. cold water 1 1/2 tsp.
gelatin 4 c. powdered sugar 1/4 c. light corn
syrup 1 1/2 tsp.
glycerine 1-2 tbsp.
vegetable oil Equipment: Covered saucepan
Large mixing bowl Wooden spoon and plastic
wrap.
Step 1.
Pour the water into the saucepan and heat
on low to medium heat for a few minutes.
Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and stir
to dissolve.
Cover the saucepan and turn off the heat.
Step 2.
Put the sugar in a large mixing bowl and make
a small well in the center.
Pour the corn syrup and glycerine into the
well, then pour the warm gelatin mixture over
the top.
Lightly oil the wooden spoon and fold the
sugar into the liquid mixture until well combined.
Step 3.
Lightly oil your hands and start mixing the
dough with your fingers until it becomes stiff.
Knead the dough thoroughly -- use your elbows!
-- until the sugar is incorporated.
If the dough is too sticky, add more oil to
your hands and rub it into the dough until
it becomes pliable.
Step 4.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled surface
and continue kneading it until it becomes
very smooth and shiny.
Step 5.
Shape the fondant into a ball and wrap it
tightly in plastic wrap.
Let it rest at least 20 to 30 minutes before
rolling, shaping, or covering your cake.
You'll have enough to cover a two-layer 8-inch
cake.
Did you know Many European bakeries still
use centuries-old fondant recipes to decorate
cakes.
