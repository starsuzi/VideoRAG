and this is Mark here with my Sushi
daddy.com I Love Sushi I love it so much
in fact I taught myself how to make it
and now I want to teach you so please
enjoy my video tutorials on how to make
western style Sushi rate and comment and
enjoy the
sushi so here are the fish cakes or
crabsticks that I use for spicy crab
they're the ones I get from the Asian
market and they come individually
wrapped first thing we're going to do is
go ahead and unwrap the fish sticks or
the crab
sticks because they come individually
wrapped takes a little bit of time but I
found that these are some of the best
tasting fish sticks out there little
over $10 for the package that you saw at
the Asian
market just get all that stuff out of
the
way now one thing you need to make sure
you you do before you make the spicy
manise is take a coup of paper towels
and press out some of the water that are
in the fish cakes if you leave this
water in there when you're getting ready
to make sushi you could just make a big
mess and you'll have some problems with
the the sushi rolls the rice uh sticking
to itself so you see all that water
that's in there you don't want that in
your sushi when you go to make
it and now I like to cut them into
thirds you can cut them into half if you
like it's a little bit more
stringier but I find the thirds are good
and they just separate like this into
small little
strands now I'm just going to take it
and put it
in a small dish here and break up some
of the pieces into the small strands
and there we
have well some of it's going to break up
when you go ahead and mix it up with the
mayonnaise and the hot sauce anyway so
you don't have to get it perfect
okay so now we're going to add the
mayonnaise and it really depends on the
individual if you like it a little more
creamier add a little more mayonnaise if
you like it less cream you add less
mayonnaise for this size
dish uh a little over two
tablespoons and now for the hot sauce I
use the Sriracha hot sauce you can get
this at any major market now and
definitely all the Asian supermarkets
will have
it it's a great hot sauce I use it in a
number of things besides my Sushi I put
it in cocktail sauce and my spicy
crab my fish chip just a ton of
different things so then you're just
going to mix it very
well and now you we start off with a
little bit you can always add more and
that's mayonnaise and hot
sauce so what I suggest is take a little
bit mix it up see how the consistency is
and then taste a little bit and see how
hot it
is and you just want to get it
thoroughly
incorporated into the the crab strands
we put a little bit more in here you can
also tell by the
color now one thing you're going to want
to do with this spicy crab mixture is
cover it with saren wrap
and put it in the fridge so it it firms
up a bit you definitely want to use it
nice and
cold and that's how you make spicy
mayonnaise great for rolls you can put
it on top of
rolls enjoy
