hello I'm Carol Peterman owner of table
fair.com if you love the spicy flavors
of blacken fish I've got a Cajun
blackening seasoning you're going to
love you can use this spice blend to
season all sorts of dishes because it's
super tasty even without blackening for
the Spice blend combine 2 tablespoons of
Hungarian paprika
and this paprika doesn't have any heat
to it so the heat is going to come from
a different
spice and then 2 tablespoon of
thyme and when you're working with herbs
it's nice to crumble them between your
palms so that you break the leaves up
and that help helps release the
[Music]
flavor and next is a tablespoon of
garlic
granules and a tablespoon of onion
powder and these just go right in
and also a tablespoon of dried
oregano we'll crumble this one as well
to release all that fabulous Aroma and
flavor then we'll add two teaspoons of
granulated sugar and the sugar in this
spice blend is going to help develop the
blackening as it caramelizes in the hot
pan
and now the heat is a teaspoon of
cayenne
pepper this gives gives it that Cajun
Cook
kick and then we also need one tbspoon
of freshly ground black
peppercorns so that just gets mixed up
and I don't include salt in the blend
because I prefer to Salt each dish
individually depending on what it is now
there are two two important points um to
developing a successful blackened crust
smoking hot cast iron pan which we've
got happening over here and thin food so
about half inch thick fillets are ideal
now you can also cook outside on a
screaming Hot Grill if you want to avoid
smoking up your kitchen but don't use a
non-stick pan for blackening because the
heat required for a nice blackened crust
is just tooot hot for a nonstick
pan uh now to use this blend to make our
blacken fish
we just need to coat each side of our
fish fillets with a little bit of melted
butter and then I'm also going to Salt
this so that we get that seasoning
on and the
butter is going to
help the spice mix stick so that is not
only
flavor but it acts as spice
glue so each side of our fish gets a
little
coating and then the spice
blend it's if you put it out on a nice
flat tray or dish make makes it easy to
coat your fish so we'll just pour it out
here and then each one of these gets a
nice solid
coating of blackening
seasoning and the pan is getting good
and smoking hot so that is about ready
ready to
go and these fish fillets look
beautiful so I'm going to turn the heat
up a little bit on this
pan and as I mentioned this will smoke
wildly which is what you need to get a
good blackened crust on your fish so I'm
going to turn on the super powerful vent
fans here and you won't really be able
to hear me very well the fish is going
to go in get a quick flip and just cook
until it's nice and black so you'll see
what I mean
[Music]
all right you can see this is smoking
smoking hot and this is what we're after
this beautiful blackened
crust that you can only get with this
kind of a smoking hot pan
so it goes quickly because you're
cooking a thin food on a hot pan now
serve this uh with your favorite side
dishes I like to serve it with a little
lemon wedge and I also really love it on
a nice crusty baguette as an Open Face
Sandwich enjoy
