bzac was out running around the yard
today and he came back and he had a
blood bloody ear he had a bloody ear um
and it's sort of subsided now uh it's
definitely clotted and I rinsed it a
little bit but I want to show you
something else I did that uh is a
natural stick from the garden let let's
go ahead and find the Yaro plant
Achilles
molia and um we'll apply it to our ear
uh the oldfashioned way come with
me here we are and if we could show the
plant this is the plant at a season but
I'm sure you've seen this before it
grows just about everywhere and um
especially in any Mediterranean
environment um it's called Achilles
molia
otherwise known as
Yaro and um if you don't have the
blossom which is what you usually use
because they're out of season and these
are usually big yellow umbellifer
blossoms and uh we could just use some
of the fresh leaves coming out some of
the new growth you can see right here
and see he's already eating it he likes
it but I'm going to take
this that has a bitter flavor I'm
chewing it up
I'm going to just chew it
up until I get enough and it's going to
give you Cod mouth it's going to dry
your mouth out that's cuz it's a stip
tick it dries everything it's a
stringent you can eat eat it
too and once you have it chewed up
you'll see
it's a little green
ball and you apply that to the end of
the air it's also um
antibacterial uh so don't worry about
putting your spit right on there it's
not a big deal I think it actually helps
uh them heal up better than uh something
like baited IR or and you just hold it
on there try and press it on there for a
while and you see how he's he's grazing
on it he he likes it I
think
um there's no question that that uh this
plant is a nice helpful plant a lot of
these antibacterial properties from
Plants evolved to try and keep grazing
animals away from them but uh
surprisingly not only did they uh work
against grazing animals but they served
as a little Medicine Chest
hello
hi again I'm going to put this on them
you can see I already put I put it on
there there's absolutely no blood on
there at all now I mean this will stop
tail whip whip tail this will
stop uh nails cut nails um this will
stop some of the hardest things to
stop and it doesn't hurt there's no
burning sensation or anything like that
it's just a good old natural stip tick
Achilles molia everybody love it
like it subscribe and um all that happy
horse thank you um I just did it um
it's dried up real nice just a second
ago that was bleeding everywhere there
was blood there's blood on my floor and
on the walls and everything cuz there's
a lot of circulation uh in the ear
