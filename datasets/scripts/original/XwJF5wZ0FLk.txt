okay cleaning some um tape adhesive this
uh unit had some construction I put
covered down with the adhesive
underneath so I'm just going to clean
the adhesive with a spray bottle has a
anomaly in it uh that's about probably
uh uh quite a few ounces to the court
it's not a 50/50 but it's a strong
anomaly mix I'm just going to pre-spray
this
anomaly which I've used before loosens
up the
adhesive
and what I have in the uh machine here
is a incap green with a little boosted
with a little intensity
green and just going to agitate the
incap pend and then go over it with a
dry
pad
now I'll switch out the PS and and uh
keep extracting some
more I added a little more anomaly to
that area that was dark and I'm just
letting it sit and agitated and then
I'll go over again with the dry
pad I'll lay a little more in cap in
with the brand new uh dry
pad a little more inap make sure I kep
all on anomaly and then I'll flip the
pad over do it
finish with dry still wet all the black
stuff is gone but what I'm I'm not
trying to just get dirt out of this car
I'm trying to get the adhesive
encapsulated on that
fiber when it's dry it needs to be
vacum
flip this one over just one dry side and
just finish drying this carpet
up
got to just come back wait till it's dry
vacuum it
