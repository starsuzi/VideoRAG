hi
my name is erin courtney today i'm going
to show you how to make super soft
chocolate chip cookies i have a pet
peeve when it comes to cookies if i try
to bite into one and i feel like one of
my teeth are going to crack
then it's probably not a cookie that i'm
going to try to eat again so
this is a recipe that i found several
years ago it actually has
one box of instant pudding mixture in it
and i think that's really what helps
with keeping the cookies so soft even
after they're done baking
so what i'm going to do here is i've
mixed everything together
and i've got my cookie scoop
and i'm going to put the dough
on my baking stove
and i like to use a baking stone i got
this from pampered chef you can get them
from
pretty much anywhere i believe bed bath
and yellow has them but
they are wonderful for making cookies
because a lot of times if you make
cookies
on a regular baking sheet they look fine
on the top but on the bottom
they're a little bit darker they could
be a dark brown whereas they're perfect
on the top
so this way with the baking stone
the cookies are cooked evenly all the
way through so you don't have to worry
about
uneven baking
okay so now that i have all my cookies
on the baking stone
i'm going to put them in the oven at 350
degrees for about 12 to 14 minutes
okay so the cookies are done baking i've
taken them out of the oven and i'm going
to use a little floppy
spatula here this gives a little more
give whenever you're taking the cookies
off of the cookie sheet
so i'm just going to scoop them onto my
cooling rack
and what i do here with the cooling rack
is i put one layer of paper towels on
top so the cookies don't sink through
in between the little wires so then it
gets all messy
and because when you first take them out
of the oven they're very soft very warm
and they bend
okay so i'm just going to let those cool
they don't take that long to cool but of
course if you're like me
and most of my family you're going to
want to
want to eat one of these when they
haven't been cooling for very long but
just don't eat them
directly off or you'll burn the roof of
your mouth or
worse so anyway just let them cool for a
few minutes and then dig in
now for my favorite part we get to test
the cookies
so they are all cooled off and i've
stacked them on top of each other we
actually have some more
baking in the oven this batch actually
makes about four dozen
it's a slightly crispy outside on the
top and bottom
and it's very soft and moist on the
inside these are perfect
so if you want the recipe for this go to
my website at supersweettooth.com
and i'll show you exactly all
ingredients and how to make it so
thanks and have a great day
you
