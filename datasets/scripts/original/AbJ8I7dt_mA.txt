hi everyone just for sweets here
today i am going to show you how to make
a homemade
pancake mix so that you can have it in
your pantry and ready to go
normally i buy like the box ones but i
always want to make my own so that i
don't have to go buy those
so i'm going to show you today how to do
that and this is a really great pancake
recipe
and we're just going to do the dry part
today and maybe another day i'll make
one and show you how they turn out
so basically what you need for this is
two cups of flour we have
three tablespoons of sugar
or about two and a half tablespoons
right around there but i think i put
three tablespoons of sugar in there you
can cut that down a little bit if you
want to
we also have five teaspoons of baking
powder
i have some dried buttermilk and i can
tell you what to do
um if you don't have that and
i'm gonna i always add a little bit of
cinnamon to mine that makes it
that's just like the secret key
ingredient and you can omit that as well
if you want to
or replace it with nutmeg or something
like that and then we're going to use
about a teaspoon of sea salt
so basically all you're going to do is
i'm going to put it in my mason jar
and i'm going to put the flour in first
so this is our two cups of flour
i'm trying to do it slowly so i don't
make a huge mess
just put that right through the funnel
no need to pre-stir we can shake this up
once it gets in there
all right so there's our two cups of
flour now feel free to double this
recipe if you want to so that you can
make more
we're going to go ahead and add our
sugar
and that just gives it a little bit of
sweetness
and then we have our baking powder not
baking soda baking powder
we're going to add our one teaspoon of
sea salt
sea salt's a little bit strong so it's a
little bit
they can you know overpower so don't do
too much
dropping things i'm going to go ahead
and i'm going to
do about a teaspoon of cinnamon like i
said you can cut this out you can add
more you can add less
you can also substitute it for something
else
okay and the last ingredient i have is
buttermilk this is dry buttermilk that
you can get at the supermarket
and i like buttermilk in my pancakes and
i don't always have it on hand so i
figure if i put the dry
in with my dry mixture then i've got
that in there and we can just add water
to the pancake mix
but if you do not have this you can
leave this one out
it's not like it's a must but it just
adds a little bit of extra flavor and
tang to your pancakes
so if you don't have it you can
substitute
when you add the liquid to your pancake
mix you can substitute
buttermilk then or you can just use milk
but i like to add this to mine so
basically what we need
is four tablespoons of our dried
buttermilk
go ahead and add that in
i use buttermilk in a lot of my baking
and i have this on hand just in case
and for things like this so there it is
one more time it's in
the baking aisle i believe a little bit
on the expensive side but
it goes a long way all right so
basically that's it
we're going to go ahead and we're going
to take our dry mix put the lid on
and just shake it up a little bit make
sure all those ingredients are
incorporated now if you want to skip
this step and just put it in a bowl you
can
but why dirty another dish so i just
kind of mix it like this
and everything's mixed together go ahead
and label your jar this is your
homemade pancake mix and you have it
ready to go for whenever you want to
make some pancakes
and if you're always in a hurry like i
am in the morning and my daughter wants
pancakes it makes it nice and easy
so to this when you make your pancakes
you're basically going to add half of
the mixture so this will make
two sets of pancakes so cut this recipe
in half or you know use half of the
mixture and to that you're going to want
to add
one egg and three quarters cup of
milk or water but since i have the dry
buttermilk in there you can just add
water to it
i mix that up put it in a preheated pan
and it's ready to go
so i just wanted to share that quick tip
with you on how to make your own
homemade pancake mix
and have it ready to go for when you
want to make pancakes if you have any
