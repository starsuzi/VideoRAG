hey everyone it's me damma and today i'm
going to be showing you guys how to make
a really nice
strapless dress so if you want to know
how to do it step by step just keep on
watching
so first we have to make a few
measurements and we have to know like
how big we
we need our piece of fabric
and we're going to be measuring our um
chest and from our armpit to our armpit
and it's going to be our
right across our chest and mine is 33
inches
but i'm going to be adding 10 inches so
it's a little looser
so from here to here was 33 inches
and i'm going to be adding 10 inches so
it's a little looser around the chest
and then after we're going to be
measuring how long
we want the p the dress and you measure
it from
your chest from right here all the way
to where you want it
and mine's going to be 33 inches so are
we're going to be cutting our piece of
fabric
and it's going to be 43 inches
by 33 inches long
and right now i have it folded in half
and it's folded right here
right here it's folded and something
else that you guys need to do
as well is measure your
your bottom and make sure that it does
it won't be too tight for example mine
was from
the circumference of my butt was 37
inches and it's going to be in total 43
inches all around so it's going to be
it's going to be um it's not going to be
that loose on the bottom
but it's going to be a little looser so
we just make sure
that our butt area is going to be
a little less than the
43 inches across from here to here
so it's gonna be fine and we have to
measure where we
uh where our waist is located at so from
here
to where my waist is located at which is
like right here
is 12 inches which is from here
from here to here which is 12 inches
and what you're also going to be doing
is you're going to be grabbing some
elastic this is like about a fourth of
an inch elastic
and you're going to be putting it around
your chest and make sure it's not too
tight or
too loose and when you have the amount
you
you want when it's comfortable enough
you're going to cut it
and that's going to be your chest
elastic and then you're going to be
so you're going to be doing the same
thing around your waist so you're going
to grab the elastic put it around your
waist make sure
make sure it's not too tight or too
loose and when it's comfortable enough
you're going to cut it
and i already have mine cut out once for
my waist and ones for
my chest so now that you have your
elastic already cut
what you're going to be doing is you're
going to be laying your piece of fabric
just like so and you're going to start
right here
and you are going to pin that there
so make sure you pin it here
make sure you pin the end of this
elastic on the end of
this fabric
just like so and that's going to help
you know how much you have to stretch
for example
you're going to have to stretch this
when you're sewing it along your sewing
machine
make sure you put your fabric like so
and do not stretch the fabric what
you're going to be stretching is
elastic so what you're going to be doing
is this and you're going to be sewing a
line
straight across on top of the elastic
and when it's sewn
it's going to look like that something
like that
and you're going to be doing that along
the top
portion of the dress so you're going to
be doing this and then you're going to
be sewing it
so i'll be coming back and i'll show you
guys
so this is how it looks once i sewed the
elastic on the top portion of the dress
and let me show you up close
just like that and the back
looks
like that all along the top portion of
the dress
so after the chest elastics done we're
going to be doing the
waist elastic and you're going to
measure from
the top portion of the chest area
down to where you had measured your
waist
mine was 12 inches and i already did a
mark here
and on the other side as well and i'm
just going to be following one line
on the fabric so it's easier and i'm
going to be pinning
one side of the elastic
like so and grab the other end
and i'm going to be following this line
right here
so i'm going to be putting it on this
end
and bringing it here
and you're going to be doing the same
thing as you did in the chest area
so this is how it looks once i put the
waist elastic on and now what we're
going to be doing is we're
going to be folding it in half
so now um the next and final step is
going to be sewing along the side of the
dress
which is right here and you're going to
be sewing it along here
and make sure you pin the dress because
um you don't want it to move
and this isn't this is actually not
going to be the side of the dress
this is going to be the back of the
dress
so this right here you're going to sew
this along here
and i'm going to be sewing this and i'll
be coming back
so this is how it looks once it's done
and let me show you up close
so that's how it looks from the front
from the middle and from the slot from
the bottom
so this is how it turned out and it
turned out really really nice um
