I decided it would be a good idea to go
ahead and snug this back fabric
down make my pattern matching on the
arms a little bit more accurate
[Music]
I've got the back fabric tacked along
the back rail as I bring the pattern up
I've centered it on this
stem got it squared up with the deck
well I got pretty lucky with this fabric
on
the vertical pattern layout I didn't
leave myself an inch to
spare I'll work with it a little
bit I'm going to measure off of the
pattern right
there my sample page says this is a 30in
repeat but it's actually
32 come back to the crevice just a
little
bit it's about 32 and a
half brush it in a little more and call
it good there
[Music]
I've got my vertical alignment spot on
with this point 9 and2 in matches the
other
side I'll pull the slack out of this
Fabric
and I'll work towards getting this stem
aligned at three and A2 to match the
other arm
now work the fabric back into the
frame and got an 8 O tack mounted on the
end of this me magnetic
Hammer I'm try to carefully find my way
back in there
[Music]
I'll wrap this side panel underneath
and square it up with that
rail only need to shoot a few
Staples just hit them every few
inches I'll pull this burlap
over and I'll do the same I'll line it
up with this
rail I'll get it
tight I'll press
this cardboard tack stri up against
the rail
[Music]
I stripped the fabric off of this arm
panel and I found that the last person
just piled up several layers of
cardboard and isn't worth
fixing I took two layers of heavy
cardboard I'll Bond these together
I cleaned up the lines
and made a new paper pattern
here the other one
was pretty much off the mark in a couple
places
[Applause]
I'll use a riffling tool
and rasp out
a Groove here where I need to ease this
fold around the
corner use that piece of wood as a
straight edge just to get me started
[Music]
okay there's a wrap on our face
panel I'm going to find a dark spot here
in this
pattern drive a finish nail through
there
I try to clean the nails sometimes
they'll leave a gray residue and a
mark stop short
so I can grab that if I need to make an
adjustment
get that all seated in nicely with a
dead blow
hammer makes that fit nice and
tight work carefully with the
regulator and tuck it through that
fabric
and just go a little bit at a
time really Risky Business you don't
want to pop any
threads all right we did
it okay that's our wrap on finishing out
the arms
I'll pull this back in and smooth it up
tighten up this uh Foundation some more
for
all right that's a wrap on the sofa
frame
