AntWorks provides you
with a revolutionary way
to observe the astute
architectural brilliance
of nature's beloved ants.
This six and a half inch by
six inch space-age habitat
is based on technology
used by NASA.
The translucent
gel not only allows
you to watch the ants create
their network of tunnels,
but also provides the ants with
food and water for survival.
Speaking of ants, you
must collect your own
or order some from the
enclosed order forms found
in your AntWorks
instruction manual.
This instruction
manual also includes
tons of interesting ant facts.
Once you've received your
batch of ants, remove the lid
and poke four holes
in the gel using
the included two and
a quarter inch stick.
These holes act as starting
points for the ants
to begin tunneling.
Next, insert approximately 20
to 25 ants into the container.
Larger ones, such as harvester
ants, are recommended.
Their size makes them
easier to observe,
and their large mandibles
are great for tunnel digging.
Avoid mixing different
species of ants,
as they could spend
more time fighting
than actually creating tunnels.
Because the gel is a very
foreign environment for ants,
24 to 48 hours may pass
before any digging occurs.
As you watch the time lapse
footage of our ants in action,
keep a few things in mind.
First, avoid storing the
AntWorks in direct sunlight.
Ants prefer shade, so put
them in a room temperature
between 50 and 74 degrees
Fahrenheit if possible.
Second, the gel consists of
more than enough food and water
for your ants to survive.
In addition, ants
require little oxygen,
so the small holes on
the lid are sufficient.
However, opening t lid for
a few seconds every week
wouldn't hurt.
Finally, ants generally
have a lifespan
of one to three months.
Some may live longer, and some
may expire before a month.
Once the ants have begun digging
and their intricate tunnels
begin to form, you can study
their unique, intelligent
behavior up close.
Their network of tunnels is
nothing short of amazing.
AntWorks comes with a
magnifying glass, allowing you
or your child to
observe specific ant
mannerisms unable to be
seen by the naked eye.
The included extreme
zoom lens lets
you get even closer
to the action.
AntWorks also comes with
a 120 volt A/C adapter.
Once plugged in, the adapter
powers the bright blue LEDs
attached to the base
of the container.
The resulting
illumination beautifully
highlights the
tunnels in the gel.
Talk about a cool
nightlight for your kids.
All in all, AntWorks
provides you
and your children with an
entertaining and educational
peek into the lives of nature's
hardest working insects-- ants.
