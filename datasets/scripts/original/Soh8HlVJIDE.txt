Hello and Welcome to Neeta in kitchen.
Today we will make
Kasuri methi or dried Fenugreek leaves at home.
It is very simple to prepare kasuri methi at home.
It can be made in two ways.
You can either make it in a microwave or
you do not have a microwave at home,
you can spread fenugreek in a wide utensil
and dry the leaves in sun for two to three days.
Let us look at the ingredients for microwave process.
We have taken 350 grams of fenugreek
and we will take out, its leave in a bowl.
Kasuri methi is used in many gravy dishes.
When fenugreek is not available apart from its season.
you can add this dried fenugreek in potatoes
to make yummy aloo methi.
We have taken out all the leaves and kept it in the bowl.
This will be around 150 grams.
Now we will microwave these fenugreek leaves
at 60% power for 5 minutes.
Spread the leaves properly
so that it is evenly microwaved.
Also when it Is been microwaved stir it a little.
So that all the leaves are properly microwaved.
If  you do not have microwave at home.
Keep these leaves in sun spreading it properly.
And the leaves will dry in two to three days
Remember that the fenugreek leaves are absolutely dry.
before it is microwaved.
After being microwaved for 5 minutes at 60% power.
We will again microwave the fenugreek leaves,
for two minutes at 80% percent power.
Now give it a 10 minute standing time.
After 10 minutes we will see that
our kasuri methi is ready.
You can keep it in an airtight container.
And use it whenever required.
