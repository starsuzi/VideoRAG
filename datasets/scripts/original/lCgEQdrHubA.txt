Hey everybody, it's Rosie and today on I
Heart Recipes, we are making southern
deep fried okra, a southern favorite. So
let's get started. We're starting off
with our okra, I chose to use frozen. I
let it thaw out. You can definitely use
fresh if you choose. So the okra is all
cut up and ready to go. I'm going to
drizzle some buttermilk all over my
okra, we're just going to drizzle - do not
drench. Then season the okra with a
little bit of seasoning salt and some
ground black pepper. Then we're going to
use our hands to make sure everything is
nicely coated with the buttermilk and
the seasonings. Now to sprinkle in some
all-purpose flour. Once again, let's use
our hands to make sure everything is
nicely coated. And now I'm going to
sprinkle in some yellow cornmeal. You can
definitely use white cornmeal if you
choose, but yellow cornmeal is my
personal preference.
Once the okra is nicely coated, they
should not be sticking together. It
should look just like this. And then
you'll be good to go. Don't forget, for
complete measurements, come visit me at
my blog at IHeartRecipes.com and you
can print out the recipes from there. So
my deep fryer is full with my nice hot
oil, it's good to go. And I'm going to
carefully drop my okra into the deep
fryer. It only takes about 2 to 3 minutes
for the okra to fry. Once it's nice and
golden brown, remove it from the deep
fryer and then you're going to place
your okra on a paper towel-lined plate.
The paper towel is going to absorb the
excess oil and just let it cool down. If
it doesn't have enough salt for you, at
this time, make sure you salt it. Don't
