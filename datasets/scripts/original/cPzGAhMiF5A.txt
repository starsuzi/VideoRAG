okay so I got here is the
uh stainless steel bottle water that I
bought on
Amazon so let's take a look at
[Music]
it so here's the bottle itself too very
sturdy on your hand bought this for my
wife it's not too big it's kind of like
your regular bottle water but you know
get the open top that easy to close this
is a uh silicon
rubber here on top to keep the water
inside it's very
smooth that's what it look like here
around the
opening you can't I don't know you can
see that is very smooth top here
you got some
uh back
there so this is a really basic
uh you know St that's still so it does
it does attract a magnet but it's very
light it's not too strong this is a uh
super strong magnet and the top here
seemed like it's aluminum or still it's
maybe it's a better kind of stainless
steel it's less attractive to a magnet
than the body is so uh the
top um look very good
overall not too heavy very
light
you stand very
sturdy so that's that's all I can really
show you on this bottle water it's very
pretty there's no branding or There's No
Label of any sort on the outside of the
bottle and the only thing you see here
is the sticker here there's no
instruction or anything for this bottle
either so whatever spec that you see
online is whatever you're going to get
uh as far as the bottle itself is very
good so all right thank you for watching
all righty
