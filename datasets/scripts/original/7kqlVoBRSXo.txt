guys today I bought a Canen boack it is
peach color you can't really tell in
it's light sorry um yeah so I thought
I'll treat myself this isn't the mini I
think this is one of the medium versions
um so I thought you know what treat
myself so bought it brought it home and
I thought right let's get it ready for
work and I thought hold on a
minute my arms aren't getting through
this
what can I do about
that there's a guy on YouTube already
who suggested you know just unbuttoning
these completely and leaving them down
but I thought it's a good
idea but I felt a bit exposed if you
know instead of having doubles and you
have singles and I thought well what if
it gets caught what if someone grabs
your bag you know and then I thought we
we could tie a little bow here and I
thought digging it back it'll drive you
drive me mad so I thought right what can
I do so racked my brains went to the
husband what he suggested was as you can
see here with our little fox button this
is where it's attached originally all
the way down to this bit now he said why
don't you just unbutton this and then
push it all the way down like I have on
this one here's one I made earlier so
the button comes down
here so all you have to do
is unclip from
here I'm not going to do it now one
handed there we go and what you do is
you
pull pretty
much like
this and then pull
it like that not the best video I
apologize um yeah
and then look at that your straps are
bigger to go around your arms so there
we go um I'm not sure
why there's only mini tutorials out
there that's the best solution that we
could come up with for now hopefully it
helps some people um so yeah there we go
adjusting the straps on your can can
bags I hope I said the name right and I
hope that proves useful to someone so um
yeah
cool
