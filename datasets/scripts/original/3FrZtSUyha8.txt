started
the first you have to do is to make the
head using some black fondant

some round cookie cutters to make the
goggles
now using some edible metallic food
paint paint the goggles so they look
like metal and shiny

shape that looks like this and now using
a spatula make a line in the middle
and now pink beads as well with your
silver metallic paint

do the exact same thing with the white
fondant except this time you're gonna
have to cut a small hole in the middle

the eye
now it's time to frost your cake
now cover your cake in the yellow
