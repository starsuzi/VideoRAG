hey guys I'm Skye and today I'm going to
show you a quick and easy way to catch
spiders and flies or whatever other kind
of bugs to get stuck on it so you only
need one thing and it's duct tape
so just break you off a piece
and put it together
[Music]
and pick a place to put it kind of out
of the way
now you can put it in you can line your
closet with it your cabinets
underneath the bar like the countertop
you can put it I don't know underneath
the refrigerator but I like to put it in
the window
see I have it lined right here because
there's nothing worse to me than waking
up and hearing a fly inside the window
it's really annoying so that's where I
put it
so there you go if you have duct tape
you catch spiders later guys
