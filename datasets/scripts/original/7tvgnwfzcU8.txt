hi I'm anony W Thompson welcome to my
kitchen chop it up a little bit pop it
in the OV and then F in the chocolate
roughly 18 to 20 minutes over the top
good recipe to get the kids involved
that was pretty easy wasn't it nice and
smooth
perfect a paneton and Clementine bread
and butter pudding is my Twist on a much
loved classic made from Italian paneton
or a rich fruit bread and sliced
clementines it's a truly delicious
pudding that's really easy to prepare so
the first thing to do is actually look
at our ingredients this is paneton which
is like an Italian sort of Christmas
bread cake pudding whatever you want to
say it's available all way around now so
you can get it anytime year no problem
we've got that sliced up we got some
vanilla extract we got a little bit of
butter some nutmeg some clementines you
could use oranges not a major problem to
me we've got some cream we've got some
milk semis skin milk if you want to keep
the fats down a little bit some eggs and
of course we've got Splender instead of
sugar so let's start cooking I take the
panonia which we've just sliced up now I
say it's available all the year around
now but if you can't get it this an
ordinary fruit cake would do or or a
fruit bread would do it's fine and use
your imagination a little bit of butter
I do like a little bit of butter that's
the sort of man I am how I keep my
figure there we go just scraping
really we've put in about 40 G it's
about an oun and a half you might want
to use a little bit less if you want to
okay that's a case of really putting it
together so we're just going to put in
the triangles
here now if you want to make the slice
as thinner please feel free but I'm
trying to make the recipe as quick as I
can I can for
you and then we got our Clementine
slices which you can just jot around pop
them in amongst the
bread that's all ready for our cream and
egg
mixture just going to break in the three
eggs a bow like
that
little bit of cream single
cream and add about4 of a pint 150 Ms
just beat that up so the eggs don't have
any viscosity at all it's all nice and
smooth add a little bit of vanilla
extract about a teaspoon or
so that and then the
milk
enough and of course there's one vital
ingredient is missing and that's the
Splender and we're just going to use
three
tablespoons of Splender just go in there
like
that and that is all ready that's it now
we're just going to pour that
over our paneton and
mandarins and the trick always with
bread and butter pudding is to let it
soak up so all that is floating at the
moment but if you leave half a now that
will have soaked into the cake and it'll
make it when it Cooks it become really
light and sort of souled okay so a
little bit of nut MEC Goods over the top
of that and that is
literally that pop that aside there and
let it
rest okay it's had it 30 minutes resting
time just remove the cling film and just
pop pop it in the oven it's 180Â°
Centigrade for about 30
minutes until that custard is nicely set
up time for a cup of
tea okay tea time over time to see the
finished result a lovely paneton bread
and butter pudding look at
that bubbling away it's sou laid up
beautifully that is a Fab pudding I
think you'll agree time for nice little
wedge I
think
beautiful just let that cool a little
bit All That Remains is for me to taste
the fruits of my
labor it's hot
but it's gorgeous so for more delicious
