hey guys welcome to eating good with
Rick and Jerry today we have for you a
chicken
Pole now to start you're going to want
to boil 7 quart of water in a 10q
pot you're going to have 25 dried
California chili pots and you're going
to add 1 to three Chile arol
pods depends on how spicy you want to
make it you're going to get about 5 to 6
chicken breast and you're going to cut
the chicken into large
chunks you're going to cut half an
onion and you're going to leave it whole
just chop it in
half add your onion to your uh
water add all your chicken into the
pot and I put too much water in that pot
so that it take them out and you're
going to add about 6 tablespoons of salt
and depends on how much salt you want
but that's how much we use we going to
use four four garlic
buds in a
blender uh you're going to blend the
chilies that have been soaked in
water and you're going to blend that
with the garlic and
cumin so you're going to blend that
thoroughly there's your 1/4 teaspoon of
whole cumin you're going to add that to
the
blender and and you're going to almost
blend it until it almost becomes a puree
not too small cuz then the chili is
going to go right through the
mes and now you're going to get your
thin mesh uh colander there and you're
going to pour the chili into the Coler
over the pot and you're going to want to
keep pouring the chili in there and just
leave it cooking in there you're going
to want to add about half a teaspoon of
oregano just to give it more flavor
and just leave it cooking for a little
bit and like I said just keep the ciner
in the pot for another 4 minutes let all
those uh flavors and marinades get in
there and once that's
done you're going
to open up your cans of homon which is
coming up
next and then so you're going to open
about four small cans or one big can of
homon I had four small cans so I open
them up and then you're going to wash
the Hony with the
water and you don't want any of that you
know extra residue so that's why we got
to wash
it okay so now you just pour the homon
into the cooked chicken um with the
chili stew there and just mix it up
it had some extra juice in there so I
had to pour it in there and you're going
to continue to cook this for about 10
minutes don't you don't want to overcook
it cuz then the homon falls
apart and just chop some cabbage you
know real small
pieces and you're going to chop some
onion too but I already had some chops
so I didn't chop
any and after the 10 minutes it's ready
to serve you just pour it over your bowl
get get a lot of that homon in there a
lot of that pieces a lot of chicken
you'll have those pieces of onion in
there so give it some extra flavor
too you don't want to get a lot of the
stock in there the stock is very good
it's very delicious especially when you
have some
tostadas uh some or some
chips and you're going to want to dress
your pole with some cabbage put on some
onions my mom likes to use radishes too

there and you're ready to go here's the
