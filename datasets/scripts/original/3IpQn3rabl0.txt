hi this is market learnhow garden.com
and in today's episode of The 10in
Garden we're going to be talking about
gbes how to plant them uh the varieties
I think are best for Taste and one or
two little tricks that will make sure
that they don't suffer from too many
problems along the way now gbur are one
of those really I think maligned
vegetables maligned fruits really that
we have um and I'm not sure why I adore
gbury fo they come early in the year
they're fairly easy to grow with some of
the bottom varieties one or two of the
old problems with G gbury milu with gbur
SF sort of been overcome and I think the
first thing you need to think of are
varieties and I've chosen to grow two
varieties this one here and this rather
Splendid looking plant is inv Victa this
is a fairly modern American variety and
it is resistant to gbury milu and sflow
which is one of the reasons we're
growing it and the reason that this is
sitting in this big bucket of water is
if if you buy anything bare rooted and
by that I mean it'll arrive literally as
these roots it's been grown in the field
it's been dug up in the winter months
you're going to plant this sort of
between
November mid to late
March and there's no soil on these roots
for very little so you don't want them
exposed to the air at all it's one of
those jobs you want to be doing on a
dull day like this you don't want to be
being out here on a baking hot day with
be Roots they'll shrivel up in a minute
2 minutes and then you have problems so
soak them if you're doing this with
trees soak them overnight if you want
and what we have here is what's called a
half standard which means it's quite
tall it's grown on a very tall single
leg and I'm growing this to show you
that you could incorporate this into
your vegetable not your vegetables into
your flower borders and you could make a
real focal point of it because it could
give you height just like a sort of uh
standard Baywood but what it will do is
of course give you this amazing sort of
fruit which is going to arrive for you
uh the fruit on this is quite large it
crops quite heavily um and it's a
beautiful sort of yellowy green the
classic gbury um color as well as been
able to get them bare rooted there are
another couple of ways you can buy them
this has got to be without doubt the
easiest way this is another invictor and
this is called a koia pot and this is
going to grow as a small Bush as you can
see it's a much shorter stem and this is
going to grow as an open Bush you can in
fact grow them as cordons like apples
along a fence at a slight angle but
we're not growing them like that here
yet but the great thing about this is
you plant the whole thing you just take
it and pop it in the ground and over
time that this co uh which is made from
the outer husks of coconuts will just
break
down and then last but not least we have
pot grown ones and this is one of the uh
hinaki red it's one of the Japanese
varieties a beautiful dark red fruit uh
I think slightly sweeter uh and again
comes slightly later than Victor so it's
to give us a bit of color a bit of
variety and That's a classic pot grown
one and the great thing about this is
whatever time of the year you're
watching this video you can grow pot
grown or you can plant pot grown fruit
at any time if it comes in a pot like
this it can be planted anytime of the
year if it's bare rooted it's really in
the Autumn and the advantage of bare
rooted is you tend to get slightly
bigger plants with a lot more root
they're going into one of our Central
beds in the garden that we've prepared
our brand new fruit garden and they need
to be about a meter and a half apart and
obviously the most logical thing is to
start with your standard one which is
going to go in the middle so you want to
prepare a
hole that you're going to plant this
exactly the same depth as it appeared in
the nursery and it's quite easy to see
where the soil depth was so that's about
a spit but you want to make your hole
slightly wider than the actual Roots so
that's the first thing we'll do we'll
get this hole dug
out now all this has been double dug and
had a lot of organic matter already
incorporated into
[Music]
it
and once your hole is of a sufficient
size the next thing to do is to apply a
couple of things the first is a really
really good
handful of fish Blood and Bone this is
an organic
fertilizer it's quite natural sprinkle
it into your hole and over the soil
you're going to back fill with
goodberries don't really need a lot of
nitrogen but they are notorious for
suffering from potach deficiency in fact
if you live in the countryside or you
have a wood burning stove this is one of
those things that if if you put fresh
wood ash obviously once it's cold around
in the winter it really does benefit
them and the next thing is our micro
risal
fungi
again spent a tiny bit of this onto the
actual
soil that's going to go back in the hole
because this is what is going to
increase the root
area then we take our bare rooted
gury as you can see if you use your
Spade the same depth that it
grew in the nursery make sure the roots
are spread out gently back fill and with
all bare root
plants you want to be doing a little
Jiggly dance as it goes in just jiging
it up and down that's to get all this
really fine soil down between all those
roots so that you've got contact between
the soil and The Roots
you've got contact between the micro
risal fungi and The
Roots don't and I've seen this done
before try to push it down with the end
of your Spade I've seen people Cho most
of the roots off their plants before and
then we gently start to
heal
in and the other thing you have to
remember even if it's pouring with rain
you're going to want to water the
in because there will not
be enough rain and for the first year
you're going to have to watch the
watering on all of your freshly
planted fruit now I am in a moment going
to top dress this and by top dressing
that means I'm going to put a layer of
well rotted
compost around the top but when you're
putting compost around any plant
think of a polo with a hole you don't
want it right up to this joint here you
don't want it touching the plant you
don't want to cause rot or anything
there so you want to leave an inch or so
away from the plant but with water first
otherwise your compost will take a lot
of that water up and absolutely soak it
you want a
good you know couple of gallons onto
every single plant you're going to put
in but what you can see by using a half
standard you get height already this
bare sort
of bed has already started to get some
height and in a second we'll get the
other two in and you'll start to sort of
get a feel of the first of our beds this
is our gubur bed but obviously we're not
just going to grow gures in here
although you need about 1 and 1/2 MERS
between each plant there are things
we'll be able to grow in between annual
uh edible flowers would be good uh we
may grow around the edge some herbs
because they're going to grow the herbs
and that will grow much higher in the
soil than these fruit and as long as
we keep it well fertilized and well
watered that'll be fine so we need some
compost now let's just shift this
along and
this is like black gold this
is compost that's come out of one of the
compost
Taps the one thing that if any of you
are Eagle OED will notice sometimes you
will
find there are the odd
stray
weed rout um I am mad keen on Nettles I
know it sounds duffed uh I love the
wildlife they bring I love using the tip
in my gardening but most of all they are
fantastic in your compost tap if you get
them in there and let them rot down they
don't I put some potach in
there
so literally like a polo water again and
that's done and that's a bare root
gbury on the other hand our other two
and it's exactly the same for these
whether it's in a COI pot or a standard
pot if it comes in a standard pot as you
turn it out if we focus in here you can
see all of these roots I'm not sure how
closely we can get in
here our next two are planted an exactly
the same way the difference is obviously
the co pot will go straight into the
ground whereas our pot ground
one literally needs to come out of its
pot exactly the same process obviously
the hole doesn't have to be quite as big
if you hadn't prepared this ground if
you hadn't literally double dug all of
it you really do need to make a fair
sized sort of space for fruit you know
it's no good just thinking you can take
a piece of the garden and dig a hole
that big that's not enough goodness with
fruit even more than vegetables it's so
important to get the goodness in at the
beginning because they're in there for
such a long period of time
exactly the same with our micro risal
fungi just because the be Roots aren't
there doesn't mean to say you're not
going to need this fungi it is one of
the real fantastic Natural
Things same with our fish Blood and
Bone and it's important not to plant
these any deeper really
than they were in the
nursery and then you can just
literally work the
soil back around firm in with your
foot by the way I'm not wearing one
glove cuz it's a Michael Jackson affect
affectation I managed to slice the end
of my thumb this morning while washing
up a carving
knife classic male thing really isn't it
you know rushing with a washing up oh I
know I put a knife in there but oh gosh
really shocked when you managed to slice
your finger on
it water in compost exactly the same and
we'll do exactly the same at the far
end with our Co pot the one thing you
want to do before you pop this in soak
it get the CO nice and wet
before it goes into the ground
exactly the same you've got your micro
risal fungi you've got fish Blood and
Bone and we'll do the same with some
compost literally round in a polo water
all three in
and then just watch the watering make
sure you keep on top of it you know if
it hasn't rained for a week or 10 days
especially in the summer give them a
good soak and we just watch how this
develops so that's Market learn how to G
and saying that's how you plant gbes
great things get them in there even
think about these half standards in the
middle of your flower border imagine
being able to walk home you've got all
those wonderful flowers you can steal a
gber and eat it before you get to the
door thanks a lot for
watching
