hi
my name is kristen corey and i'm a
personal chef
today i'm going to show you how to make
pan fried
homemade french fries all you need are
potatoes
and vegetable oil first thing we're
going to do is cut them
i don't peel them you can if you want to
i kind of like the peel
but first you want to square the potato
up
to be a rectangular so i'm going to cut
all the ends off
so it's a nice rectangle
then i'm going to slice them in about
quarter inch
slices stack them one on top of the
other
and then slice them so they're about
even so i'm going to cut my potato
first square off all the ends
the goal is to make a rectangular
rectangle
cut off long ends
and about quarter to a half inch
slices
stack them and then make them
quarter to half inch squares
and i put them in the vegetable oil
there's room temperature and then they
go to the stove
so it's been 10 15 minutes
that the fries have been in the oil
after it reached a boiling point and i
think they're just about ready
so all you do is use a slotted spoon
put him on some paper towels and cut the
heat
it's important to take your time this
oil is very very hot
you want to get them in a single layer
if possible
and now is the time to salt or season
them you can use any type of salt
or seasoned salt that you like i'm just
going to use basic table salt
because this is when it will stick to
the fries
and that's how you make pan-fried
homemade french fries
