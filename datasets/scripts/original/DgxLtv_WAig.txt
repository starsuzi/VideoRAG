in tune with the holidays my lovely
assistant brianna shattuck her mom
leslie and todd kaler are going to show
you how to make a turducken that's a
chicken stuffed into a duck stuffed into
a turkey and then thrown in the oven
it's easy enough to find prepared
turduckens online but it's not terribly
hard to do at home and it can be a fun
holiday project for the whole family
ready bree
yeah
we started by chopping up five stalks of
celery and two medium sized onions
you're also going to need a quarter cup
of paprika a quarter cup of pepper one
cup of coarse salt a quarter cup of
molasses and two sticks of butter you'll
want to mix all that together to create
a rub for later
next we prepared the stuffing added the
chopped veggies and set it aside for
later
hello everybody
then came the hard part deboning the
birds fortunately kaler had some
experience with the process but anyone
can do it you just need to roll up your
sleeves and get down to it
taylor was sure to set aside all the
bones for making stock for meals in the
future
using a sharp knife kaler carefully
remove the meat from the bones leaving
three floppy shells
the next step in the process is to rub
all the birds with the seasoning mixture
once that was finished we started by
stuffing the chicken and laying it on
top of the splayed duck
you want to lay down a layer of stuffing
about an inch or so thick between the
chicken and the duck
then we repeated the process with the
ducking and the turkey
once you've layered all the birds with
stuffing all there's left to do is
carefully wrap the bird with the kitchen
twine in a few places to keep the
monstrosity together
we added a decent splash of red table
wine for flavor and stuck into preheated
450 degree oven for one hour
at kayla's suggestion we deviated from
the normal recipe and bake the turducken
for another three hours at 350 degrees
once your meat thermometer reads an
internal temperature of 180 you're all
set
be sure to insert the thermometer in a
few different places though to make sure
you're getting a good reading among the
three layers
carving the turducken proved to be a
slight challenge as well
once the twine is removed you want to
try and slice the turducken so that
you're getting an appealing layered
effect and each slice has all three
birds in it
happy holidays
