 
hello namaste
salaamwalekum and satsriyakaal;  welcome to another episode with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.
Today I'm not cooking today
let's just mess around with some ladies
holding hands especially their lovely long
fingers
hey got you I'm talking about lady's
fingers
today we're going to make a dish with
Okras
some people are like me they like crispy accompaniments to their food. I love
eating crispy fried pakodas with my food
sometimes i even add boondi to my rice and curd today we'll make a nice
accompaniment with okra called Bhendi Jaipuri as the name Jaipuri suggest
this dish comes from Rajasthan. This Okra which is a versatile vegetable
which is called by many names
Okra, bendakaya, bhendi, bhindi and in
the southwest of US it is also called
Gumbo. This vegetable is more famously
known by its rows of tiny seeds and
slimy and sticky texture when you cut open. To make this dish
Bhendi Jaipuri, you can cut Okra into thin slices like this or you can make
nice roundels thin roundels like this and
keep it aside
you need gram flour which is called besan or you can buy on the Indian
stores you can go and ask for besan you can buy this flour, cumin seeds, salt
chilli powder
amchoor powder and little vinegar. See both of these adds tinge of sourness to your
dish
if you don't have vinegar just use amchoor powder and if you don't have amchoor
powder you could just use the vinegar
I'm going use little bit of both of them are slightly broken cashew nut
this is not a must it's optional but you
know you could use it because I love
cashew nut and i'm going to use some of
this
this dish is very easy to make all you need
to do is
take okra add your cashew nuts, a teaspoon full of Cumin seeds
Amchoor powder, add salt ,add chilli powder,chilli powder add it to your taste if you
like it spicy add little more if you have
to add besan flour now you may have
to add little water
so what I prefer is, I like to sprinkle
little bit of vinegar
ok and then mix it up real good
adding this salt and little vinegar what it
does is it brings out little moisture from
this okra so when you add flour besan
flour you don't need any more extra
water if you like to add some onions
you could also add some sliced onion but
this is not what a traditional
recipe calls for i love to add a little
onion and I love onion pakoda
so I'm just adding a little bit of onion
to this preparation.Cutting okra is a
kind of a skill
remember the more you cut it the slimier it becomes okra
Is commonly used as a thickening agent in soups and stews because of its sticky
nature there are a couple of ways you can
minimize the slime
simply trim of the end and avoid
cutting or puncturing the okra
capsules I always find a best way to
Avoid this slimy nature is slightly
soute in the oil and then add it to my
dishes and that doesn't bring any of the
sliminess to the dish and this okra is
very widely used in Africa Middle
Eastern Greek Turkish Caribbean and
South American cuisines apart from
indian cuisine
Okra is a powerhouse of valuable
nutrients
it is a good source of vitamin C low in
calories and completely fat free
it has plenty of vitamin A calcium and
fiber.A perfect candidate for a healthy
cooking on Vahrehvah.com
but how healthy it is depends upon what
you're going to cook.Today we are going to
deep fry
So to make a deep-fry healthy always
try to use, You know fresh oil
make sure you fry at a right
temperature for a right amount of time
that is when your vegetables absorb
minimum amount of oil into them
now the vegetables are sitting here for
two minutes so the salt has been brought out
a little bit moisture
so what you do take little besan and
just sprinkle on top
Ok don't mix it, overly mix it, just
sprinkle a little bit okay
there's no quantity to see from this i'm
using may be less than 1 cup maybe so
just sprinkle it like this and just let
it sit for another few minutes okay
now if your Okra is dry so then you
can add sprinkle a little bit few drops
of water
just make sure limit it to just just few drops of water you do not just crush them or try
to mix them squeeze it hard just slightly
toss them over and then you will see this
okra nicely coated with besan
now the mixture is ready so how about
frying this Okra
so all you do is, As I told you don't you
know just toss them a little bit but
not overly mix them and then drop your
Okra into the oil
Do not drop all the Okra  at once just
to drop few enough just to fry and
Fry it at a medium heat. Fry them till they are slightly golden brown
ah look at this Okra, uff and also
remember that do not make large
quantities if you're going to fry these
Okra  for a party do not mix all these
ingredients and keep it for a long time
make sure between the mixing and cooking
time we should not be more than 10
minutes
always make sure that you mix them in
small batches because once you mix in
large batches and try to fry they will all get sticky. Now that you have fried them really
good cool
look at this look at this wow
boom boom boom boom!! While I'm cooking I think of this song you know this is my lovely lady lumps by
Black Eyed Peas
Now check it out my lovely ladyfingers, my
lovely ladyfingers checking out just
like the black eye peas song and haha
these are really lickable fingers oh trust me. whenever Ifry these
Okra for parties and all that
what I do I add little extra cashew nuts and after frying i'll pick up all those
okras which the cashew nut is stick
and I keep it aside and eat with my
nice yogurt rice and so on and it is
really really good
haha
this is what you call it finger-licking
lady fingers
I hope you'll love making this quick and easy dish. Okra may also be
steamed boiled pickled sauteed stir fried as a whole and you can make so
many wonderful dishes with oka and we're going to make all these dishes in our
show but remember these ladies are very
sensitive these okras should not
be cooked in pan made of iron copper and brass since the chemical reaction take
this okra little bit black
so always try to use a steel vessel or a non-stick pan. I hop

any food or drink
