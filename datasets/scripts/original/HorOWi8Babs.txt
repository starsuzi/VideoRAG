I want to show you how to cook barley
that will take just from about 10 to 15
minutes to cook it's very simple and you
will love
it so this is how I do it I just
rinse my
barley very well
and this is like about like a pound of
barley that you can buy
winko or even at
Smiths they have it in
bulk so you rinse it very
well and then you put it here
and make sure to fill up your container
with water until it covers the
barley and then you're just going to let
it
set you do too hey be nice I am no
you're
not you let it set for 24 hours and then
we'll talk okay okay I have wait for 24
hours for my barley to soak in the
water so now I am just going to rinse it
before I
cook the
barley and this is the last portion of
it rinse it
well just one one more time to make
sure there you
go now we're just going to put
it
here in a pot to be
cooked and we're just going to fill it
up with water until it covers the barley
okay my barley has been cooking for like
15
minutes it's nice and hot it's ready to
eat and this is how it
looks is very nice and
soft I have cooked barley before and I
didn't like the result that texture was
very weird it was kind of slummy
and H kind of I don't know it was just
weird but this way I like it better plus
you don't need to cook it for so
long hope you like it
