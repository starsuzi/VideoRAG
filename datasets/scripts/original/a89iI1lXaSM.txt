Welcome to Ape Amma Youtube  channel.
Earlier I've done 2 methods of making hoppers.
Today I'm making hoppers using yeast.
This is what we need
2 cups thick coconut milk
I've done a separate video on how to make hopper flour at home. the link is in the description box.
if you buy wet flour from the mill keep it in the freezer till you make the hoppers.
but let the rice flour cool down after you've taken it out of the fridge.
if you are making hoppers right away then you don't have to keep it in the freezer.
this is after 35 minutes
if you live in a cold climate it would take a little more time to ferment.
1 tsp salt it enough for 500g wet rice flour
now mix it well so the salt is dissolved.
now I'm adding another 1 and 1/2 thick coconut milk to this.
the batter has to be a little runny.
this is after 35 minutes of adding yeast...
now after adding the coconut milk leave it for another 5 minutes before making hoppers.
then the rice flour will thicken a little.
many have issues how to season a  hopper pan...
so today I'll show you how to make hoppers in a totally new pan without seasoning it.
let the pan pre heat for a little while.
then apply some sesame oil on the pan and add the batter.
the flame has to be on high
after 2 minutes I'm loosening the hopper
by doing this after 2 minutes it's easy to remove the hopper.
because I haven't added any egg to this hopper batter.
if you add a egg to the hopper batter it would be easy to remove the hopper.
but I like the aroma of hoppers that doesn't use eggs in the batter.
also this can be enjoyed by the vegetarians as well.
mix the batter well before making a new hopper.
and wipe the pan with a paper serviette with sesame oil before making the next hopper.
after you've loosen the hopper reduce the flame and let it cook.
there are different kids of gas burners for making hoppers but for a stove like this it's better to use this method.
can you see the steam
if it's steaming hot never add the hopper batter.
wait till the pan comes to a medium heat.
if you add the batter to a very hot pan the batter will stick and you'll not be able to swirl it around the pan.
you must heat this sound when you add the batter.
it's my time to taste. :)
see how soft and well cooked the center of the hopper.
I made 21 hoppers from this recipe.
send your photos of hoppers to Ape Amma fan page.
earlier I made hopper using coconut milk and Appa soda
today I made using yeast.
I bought this new pan for Rs 350
this pans are made specially to make hoppers, so you don't need to season these pans.
just check if the inside of the pan is very smooth.
if the pan is slippery then it's good.
the lid has to fit properly as well.
when you buy make sure that all these things are correct
Now I hope you understand that when making yeast hoppers...
you don't need to ferment for many hours..
it's just like how we make baking products using yeast.
so you don't need to ferment this for 4,5 6 hours.
if you do that the hoppers will turn yellow, and taste will be different
