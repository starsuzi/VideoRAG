welcome to Common Man cocktails this

Sour this is an actual request from one
of our Watchers listeners and we just
wanted to mention a a cool website if
you go to awesome deals 911 they're

friends who like shot glasses you can
get Corona shot glass uh Corona logoed
shot glasses red stripe logos uh all
mass Market brands are out there check
it out uh so let's get
into this week's Stone Sour so what
we're going to have is we're going to
use a white tequila also known as Blanco
or
clear drono
Amaretto not a huge fan of
amarettos I don't know why it's just got
a weird nutty taste to me but I think
this will be good I've had Stone Sour
before I haven't had this recipe so this
is going to be tasted first on this
episode we also have a highball
glass minute made orange juice it's what
I happen to have in the refrigerator got
kids so we got the kids one this is the
healthy version of the stone sour and
sour mix can't have a stone sour without
sweet sour mix so let's get going what
we're going to need to do first we're
going to do 2 oz of
Amaretto this measures 1 o so we'll do
two
one
two 2 oz of clear
tequila I'm sure you can use Reposado if
you want to it just might ruin some of
the the uh the coloring that you'll get
from the Stone Sour so if you don't care
about appearance personally Reposado is
tasty might try
that we'll do this one last so we'll
cover two more ounces this time we'll do
the sour sweet sour
mix
we're going to mix that up
first throw that in our
glass now you could pour it over pour it
over ice if you want and make it look a
little more professional right now we
just want want to drink now we need a
splash of orange juice a technical
measurement for a splash is a little not
too much but not too little just enough
to give it the appearance give it a
little
flavor so there we'll just do a little
splash now that's kind of looks like an
orange juice almost like a
screwdriver now at this point you could
do if if you have them available marcino
cherries I have some I just forgot to
bring them and a SL a little wedge of
orange just to give it the uh give it a
little flare this if you're just
drinking it at home I don't think you're
going to need a need a garnish yourself
so let's give it a try cuz I haven't
tried
this that's pretty good it's um if you
don't like Amaretto don't be afraid I'm
not a big Amaretto Drinker either but
it's very subtle you
can't you taste a little nutty almost a
cherry
flavor uh a little tequila on the back
and the orange juice adds a little
flavor don't think of it as it looks
like a screwdriver it doesn't taste like
a screwdriver to me a screwdriver tastes
like uh orange juice this has a a
tropical taste to it a little orange
orange peel with a little nut so
definitely very refreshing and don't
really taste a lot of alcohol so
consider that when you start making
these for friends take their
keys but it is very
tasty well that's our episode for today
