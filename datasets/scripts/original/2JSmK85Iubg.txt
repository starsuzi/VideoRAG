all right you have to excuse the messy
Workshop but uh one thing I wanted to
test out uh somebody was talking about
using rubbing alcohol to remove tar and
this is just one of my
bags and the tendency is for these bags
to get a little bit of tar on them as
you dump them in if they touch the sides
of the uh lid or the hopper then they
will get tar on the bag and then later
that will transfer to your hands so I'm
not really interested in cleaning all my
bags but um since I do I don't have a
good source of tar right now this is
pretty much the only tar that I can get
my hands on at the moment to test this
out with so this is some old tar you can
see it's on there pretty good you can
scrape it off slowly but uh it's it's
it's tar uh it's it's it's on there good
it will come off on your hands you can
see my hand is fairly clean I rub my
hand on it a little
bit
especially on a warmer day okay so I'm
not getting that much on it from here so
this tar is actually fairly cold so it's
it's sticking to the bag it's staying
fairly solid so what I wanted to test
out was uh just dipping a little bit of
rubber and alcohol onto
a paper towel
okay just see what
happens I have not tested this
before Okay so
let me see if I can set this up
properly okay
so here is a
spot know if you can see this see this
whole area here and I'm just going to
get a clean part of the rag some rubbing
alcohol on
it start wiping this down and see what
happens
okay so you can
see after just a little bit of rubbing
that came remarkably
clean um so uh kudos to whoever
mentioned that I think it might have
been Carl Carl's in rubbing alcohol
does the trick on tar at least when it's
that tar on that bag now I have not
tried it on my hands yet like I said I
am currently in between gasifiers so I
don't have a a source of tar to get it
onto my hands with and honestly I'd be a
little I'm still a little bit nervous
about putting tar in my hand
specifically to take it off again uh
using another method but I will be
trying the rubbing alcohol in the future
because I think it could work really
well and uh there you go I mean that's
that kind of speaks for itself that was
just a paper towel a little bit of
alcohol and a a little tar that got
cleaned off
there so there you go thanks for
watching
