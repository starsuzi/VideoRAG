hey guys thanks for stopping in today
I'm going to do a pizza grilled cheese
sandwich in my toaster oven so let's get
toasting when I was shopping the other
day I saw this Greer cheese and um I had
never even heard of that before till I
was watching an episode of the kitchen
witch with Lindsay Wells a while back
and she used it for something can't
remember what it was but uh I'll put the
link to her Channel below and you guys
can check her out too she does some good
stuff but anyway I came across that I
was kind of excited that I finally saw
it and I bought it and yesterday I made
a grilled cheese with it and it was
pretty good but I felt like it needed a
little something some meat or something
in it so today I'm going to put some
salami in there and put on some
sourdough bread and I thought you know
what what I put some pizza sauce in
there too and make it like a like a um
Pizza grilled cheese so this this Greer
was
uh it's 6.49 a pound so this piece was
$42 I bought another uh package of it
since I liked it so um let's get started
I think I'll um toast the salami first
to kind of get it a little crispy like
it would be on Pizza I turned the oven
all the way up to
450° and these are pretty thin pieces of
salami so just going to let them stay in
there till they get crispy the only bad
thing about sourdough bread is the
pieces all vary in size so maybe it'll
just take a big piece right out of the
center and just cut it in half that
should
work my salami's been in here for 5
minutes or so better check on it don't
want to burn it starting to smoke better
get it out of there all right let's
build this sandwich got my half a
sourdough bread and I put mayonnaise on
the outside I always put mayonnaise on
the outside of my grilled cheese whether
I do it in the stove or the toaster oven
I just like the mayonnaise better it
spreads better and has more flavor in my
opinion we'll put a good bit of pizza
sauce on
there and let's see here salami salami
looks good I was kind of worried that I
burned it but it looks just
right so we'll get all that on
there that's quite a bit of slamy but
actually these are really thin slices so
we do that we get our cheese on
there this cheese tastes kind of like
swiss cheese the flavor of it only it
melts way better all right
now which way does this
go um
like that right so put the
mayonnaise on the top side of my bread
there when I think about cooking these
in the toaster oven the bread toasts
from the top so it's easier to tell when
you need to turn it
over um might as well put a little pizza
sauce on here too right why not make
sure it's nice and
Saucy all right that that looks good
let's get into the toaster oven set my
oven to bake at
400° and as soon as the top is brown
we'll pull it out and flip it it's been
cooking for about 5 minutes or so so
let's check it looks nice and brown I'm
going to pull it out and flip it
over kind of curious if it's brown any
at all on the underside let me flip it
here and
see
not too much we'll get it back in there
and brown that top side we'll get this
back in there and let that side Brown up
and the cheese finish melting and we'll
be back let's see how this is
doing well it's brown wow look at that
cheese let's get that out of there look
how good that cheese melted that's
another thing I like about doing it in
the toaster oven is it's in a warm oven
so the cheese melts better sometimes on
the stove if you have too thick of
cheese it doesn't melt very well so
let's try a bite of this baby sure looks
good oh this is so good the cheese is so
nice and melted and the salami is crisp
you get flavor from that pizza sauce it
tastes just like pizza
almost don't you guys wish you had one
too bad you got to make your own I'm
going to eat mine thanks for watching
and I'll talk to you next time
