hello everybody I'm the Big Easy Chef
I'd like to show you how to make
macaroni salad now can you just imagine
a bowl of creamy macaroni
salad wow you did really good now can
you visualize yourself taking a bite out
of that salad again you did a great job
but I think that spoon could have been a
little larger now this is my very own
personal secret recipe I've been making
this salad for 40 years the nice thing
about it is that it tastes great people
love it and it's easy to make once you
start making this salad you're going to
become the macaroni salad king or queen
so let's run over into the kitchen and
whip this salad up let's see what's
shaking and get to baking
to get started with the macaroni salad
take a large pot and add cold water to
it about 2 quarts to 3
quarts place the pot on the stove turn
the burner on
high wait for the water to come to a
boil once the water is boiling add the
macaroni
this is one lb of macaroni I'm using
regular classic
macaroni you could use different types
of macaroni how about seashells they
would be nice for a picnic at the
beach or how about these Wagon Wheels
they would work great for a
barbecue once the Potter water has come
back to a boil reduce the heat down to a
medium boil
cook the macaroni until it's swelled up
and nice and tender I cooked the
macaroni for 17 minutes and it always
comes out just
perfect now with the macaroni cooking on
the stove it's time to start on the
other ingredients cut some celery into
large chunks about 2 and 1/2 cups or a
half of a large stock I have the cut
celery ready to rinse with plenty of
cold water cut one sweet onion or yellow
onion will work I'm using a yellow onion
as they didn't have any of those nice
sweet onions at the
store cut the onion into large
chunks it took about 1/2 of this
mediumsized onion to make a cup of
roughly chopped
onion place the onion and the celery
into the food processor
Bowl make sure all the celery gets in
the bowl
now get in there get in that
bowl now chop up the
mixture use the PSE mode on the
processor watch the celery and onion get
a nice
ride you want to get this mixture
chopped very
fine this is exactly how fine you want
the mixture chopping them fine gives a
nice subtle flavor to the
salad take a can of large black olives
that's a 6 o can drained
weight rinse the olives to take out a
lot of the salt it is important to do
things such as rinsing the salt out of
the olives you'll end up with a nice
balanced flavor without any overpowering
flavors in your salad now slice the
olives in
half
this is a time you want to cut up some
nice roasted red bell
peppers this is going to give the
macaroni salad a nice sweet
flavor I chopped the peppers into this
size and it's about one cup of unchopped
peppers now now that the macaron is
cooked and it's nice and
tender place it in a strainer and rinse
it with plenty of cold water allow the
macaroni to drain for a while you want
to get as much of the water out of the
macaroni as you
can place the macaroni into a large
mixing
bowl dump in the black olives get those
roasted red bell peppers on top of the
olives and
macaroni add to the Bowl one 12 oz jar
of sweet pickle relish slide in the
onion and celery mixture now this is the
time for the star of the salad the
mayonnaise you're going to add 1 quart
four cups the mayonnaise is going to
make the salad be nice and creamy when I
use mayonnaise from the store I like to
use helmond or Best
Foods next add one and 1/2 teaspoons of
kosher salt drop in 1/2 teaspoon of
ground black pepper
give the mixture a good stir make sure
all of the ingredients blend well with
each
other you can taste the salad to make
sure there's enough salt and pepper as
it's easier to add some more than to
take it out I think the salt and pepper
are the only ingredients that you may
need to adjust the other ingredients
will be
perfect this salad needs to set for at
least 4 hours before eating it's better
to make it the day
before as the ingredients get a chance
to blend with each other so there you
have it now you have your own secret
recipe for macaroni salad and I have to
warn you about this part once you start
making that salad people are going to
want you to make it all the time so now
you've been warned remember what they
say you are what you eat so eat healthy
until next time I'm The Big Easy
