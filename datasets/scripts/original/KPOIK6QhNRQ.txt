Do you know the best way to make 3D shapes
in minutes? Modeling chocolate can work wonders,
when you know how to work with it. Here I'll
share my top 3 tips for success.
Hi, I'm Joshua John Russell, a cake designer
and an instructor on Craftsy dot com. Modeling
chocolate is fun and easy to work with (plus
it doesn't require drying time!), but it can
also be a bit fussy and melt while you are
working with it. I can help you with that!
Tip one....keep your cool.
I like to keep
a wet towel close by when I am working so
I can cool my hands. You could also use a
cold soda can or ice pack.
Another option is to make your modeling chocolate
a little differently. This brings me to tip
2: use coating chocolate
Real cocoa butter melts at a low temperature.
Seriously, I could melt a piece of chocolate
with my hands!
Coating chocolate has fats that are not as
temperature sensitive, so if you replace real
chocolate with coating chocolate in your recipe,
you will have more working time.
Tip 3: Use your tools! Working with gumpaste
tools, rather than your hands can help minimize
the melting.
Get your general shape.....like this chocolate
ducky and use tools to finesse the shape and
add detail.
Following theses simple tips can help you
make all sorts of fun creations quickly and
easily, like my little ducky!
