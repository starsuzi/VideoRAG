hey guys how's it going this is jason
uh with jr real life films and today
we're gonna be making uh kebabs they've
got chicken
and beef we got some bell peppers and
mushrooms
and we basically what we did was we went
to the store
bought our favorite steaks whatever
steaks that we like cut them up into
these like quarter inch pieces these are
all quarter inch pieces about the same
size as our mushroom
a little bit bigger than our mushroom
and then all of our onion slices and
whatnot we sliced them
so that there's like two or three layers
in each one so well this one's got like
four or five but
you put whatever you want on your kebab
you could put you could put mushrooms in
there you could put celery in there
probably don't want to do celery pie
burns too fast but whatever
mostly you would do is like the
mushrooms and the bell peppers
and cut those in like quarters so you
would cut it in half and cut it in
quarters
again and get you a nice little wedge
piece and that would be your guideline
for how big you want to cut
your own onions so all we did was we cut
up quarter pieces of boneless chicken
breasts
and we used um mrs dash
chicken grilled blends use this
basically put it in a bowl like this one
and just pour this in there as much as
you want i mean cover it up see like
it's a generous amount of seasoning on
there and then just mix it by hand mix
it by hand and
skewer it and then the same thing with
the meat after you got done cutting it
up into
quarter size bite-sized pieces then we
used
this perfect pinch so it's for steaks
and whatnot
we also used a mixture of this all
season
for that the steak and chicken and then
just to top it off to add a little bit
more flavor
this is msg so mixed all that in there
mixed it up of course with the chicken
separate from the beef
but at this point it doesn't really
matter because they're all going to get
grilled we're not leaving it out not
letting it
sit out for a while all right and then
we'll show you
the cooking in the next video
