 
what about friends of men cooking
in this opportunity I bring you a trick to fry chicharron
we can do it in a pressure cooker
in this way we are not going to burn
we are not going to dirty the stove, nor splash grease
let's see how it becomes acontinuacion
to prepare it we need
baking soda, lemon
in the pressure cooker
we put oil to heat
once this hot
add the pork rind
with a little bit of baking soda and lemon
we put it on the skin
we put you just a little
 
 
 
 
 
we anoint it well
a little bit of baking soda
 
 
 
 
 
 
we add salt to taste
 
 
and we proceed to put it in the pot
 
Here everyone sees them in the pot
important that the oil covers them
It is ideal for them to be well
crunchy and rich
we cover the pot
without the valve
 
 
we wait 4 or 5 minutes for steam to come out
from the top
after that we counted 10 more minutes
the steam started to come out
here you can see the steam
I do not know if they see it on screen
and from this moment we start to count 10 minutes
so that the crackling is fried
it is important to lower the temperature
 
 
 
so they do not burn
 
we can hear how they fry
 
without messing up our kitchen
 
the time has already passed
let's see how they were
we uncover the pot
it is not necessary to remove the steam because it does not have a valve
so they stayed
we take them out
are here
Hurry how they were
 
 
and look how the stove is
Is it clean
I hope you liked it
