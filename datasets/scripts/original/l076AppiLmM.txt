hey guys hope you're well okay the
lovely guys at pg tips have set me a
challenge to come up with a classic dish
using one of their incredible new teas
so i'm going to be doing slow roasted
crispy skin assam duck the most
beautiful gravy steamed rice asian
greens
this will serve six people it's gonna be
epic so first up
the duck duck is something that people
absolutely love it goes crazy in the
restaurants and sometimes people are a
bit worried to cook it but it's so
simple what's really nice to make it go
even crispier is just to score it very
lightly just in a little crisscross
beautiful i want to make this the best
duck ever so come over here and have a
look at this we are bigging up the assam
tea now i know you guys are used to
having tea as a drink and that's
absolutely brilliant i use it all the
time to liven up noodle dishes when i'm
cooking noodles give them a bit of
flavour throw one in when i cook rices i
put a little tea bag in it gives
incredible flavor
here is just one tea bag have a look at
that of the asante right
smells amazing really fragrant malty
and got a really sort of rich robust
flavor and i'm gonna do a rub i'm gonna
pair that up with chinese five spices
two nice teaspoons black pepper and a
nice pinch of salt it's like a nice
little palette of flavour use your
fingers to rub it all together
and then i want to get it onto the duck
just a little drizzle with olive oil
this is going to stick to that oil and
that skin so just rub it
all over get it right into all those
cracks and crannies this is going to
give the skin the most incredible flavor
get that into a nice snug fitting
roasting tray i'm just going to wash my
hands
we're going to whack that into the oven
for 1 hour 20 minutes
at 180 degrees celsius which is 350
degrees fahrenheit and at that stage a
load of fat would have rendered out of
the duck and i want to show you what to
do next
this dish is the gift that keeps on
giving get yourself a nice heat proof
jam jar you can get some little herbs we
can pour this fat into the jam jar the
rosemary will give it the most
incredible perfume we'll let it cool
down we'll pop that into the fridge and
that will go hard and then the next time
you start a little stew just take a
teaspoon
start to fry you know a beautiful piece
of fish you roast potatoes unbelievable
so the duck is halfway cooked just over
and there's a couple of things we can do
to make the best gravy ever carrots just
a couple a couple of onions
and a bulb of garlic throw that onto
the duck pick the duck up
shake it in that fat this duck now goes
back in the oven for 40 more minutes
and it's gonna be beautiful
so
this is the end the bit you've been
waiting for after two hours
your prize
is a beautiful crispy skin duck we're
gonna let it rest for just five minutes
see all these bits it looks like almost
it's burnt it's not burnt right it's
absolute flavor so i'm gonna put it on a
medium heat and i want to kind of just
do
a sort of asian inspired gravy just a
little bit of ginger and a little chilli
give that a little shake
we're going to add a small amount of
flour just like a teaspoon stir that in
and then use stock or
we can continue our story with the
gorgeous assam tea another tea bag goes
into the bowl i'm gonna cover that with
boiling water it's full bodied it's
fragrant it's gonna really add to making
this the very best gravy it can be let
that kind of steep for about a minute
and a half so all those elements of the
tea come out
so let's mix up this pan we're gonna go
in with the classic flavors of about a
tablespoon of soy sauce scrape off the
sticky bits from the bottom and then a
traditional cup of tea
in the gravy it goes with all the sticky
bits of goodness all the lovely duck
juices the caramelized onions and
carrots the ginger the chili so let's
bring that to the boil
have a little taste
what i quite like to do sometimes is
just balance with a little honey just a
teaspoon it's simmering away gorgeous i
love the kind of theater and excitement
of serving this i love it on a big board
i've got some lovely fluffy brown rice
really simple greens it could be asian
of course pachoy bok choy lovely
sprouting broccolis sugar snap peas it's
all good now the gravy is a chunky gravy
get yourself a bowl
finely slice a little chili sprinkle it
all over the place beautiful color get
yourself two forks pour that meat away
from
the bone like that it's tender it's so
good
that my friends

crispy skin duck so there you go guys a
