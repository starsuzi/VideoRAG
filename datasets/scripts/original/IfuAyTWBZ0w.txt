want to know the best way to stop a
bleeding claw or Jew claw that has
either been clipped Too Short well I'm
going to show you that in today's
video hi guys it's Chloe here from
everything does with Chloe and on this
channel we help you keep your hairy
Hound happy and healthy so if you're new
here please think about subscribing
because I post videos just like this one
which is a dog care one and other videos
on dog training as well also don't
forget check out all the links down
below and let's get into the video so me
and Ted have been playing outside and
doing some weaves and then I noticed
that he' got some blood on his uh porw
just where his Jew claw sit now what I'm
going to do is I'm probably going to get
some scissors and um wipe this off and
see what is going on underneath there to
see what we need to do I've got some
water here AC CL that we can wash and my
scissors I was going to use some
clippers but I think this might upset
him too much so we're going to give it a
bit of a rinse first just to see if um
if where I'm going to go is going to
hurt him too
much
um it does look like he has
knocked his Jew claw
and it I think the main thing is just to
put some pressure onto the claw that is
bleeding and just
to wipe away as much blood as possible
so you can see but don't wipe because
obviously that won't be very nice for
your dog and then you can see what's
going on so what I'm going to do now is
obviously Ted is not enjoying this so
I'm going to sit him down sit
down sit so he's a little bit more
comfortable and um just turn it and then
get the scissors and cut
around where I think is the
problem I might have to get the Clippers
on this because obviously I want to be
able to exactly see what's gone on and
what's happened but if I can get most of
it away for
now I've got my trusty tea bag here um
I'm going to dip it in the
water um and then I'm going to place it
onto his claw now he doesn't like that
so um I'm just going
to try and hold it on as much as I can
um it's really funny because I'm not
quite sure why this works but it has
worked in the past for me um and it's
really good so you want to leave this on
for probably about half an hour try not
to let your dog put too much pressure on
the leg because the more the put
pressure if it's on one of these claws
the more pressure that they put on it
the more blood that's going to come out
as they walk on it so and also try not
to look at it try not to take it off and
look at it because if it is one of these
claws it's going to keep bleeding this
is the best way that I know without
having to go to your vets to go and get
this sorted um I really hope you find
this useful and like it very convenient
this happened and um I hope to see you
