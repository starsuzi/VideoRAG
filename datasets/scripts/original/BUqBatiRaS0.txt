hey folks Philly boy J here back with
another video and today I'm going to be
showing you guys how to make beef liver
onions and gravy I love beef liver I
already chopped up a onion what we're
going to do now is we're going to fry
our onion for a few minutes just to
sauté it and then we're going to move on
to the next
step okay so to the frying pan we're
going to add some butter
we're going to go ahead and add our
onions now
and we're going to sauté them until they
begin to
wilt and get some
color okay
okay so our onions are
done I like to burn mine a little
bit going to cut this off we're going to
set our onions aside in a bowl
okay guys so here are our liver pieces
as you can see they're nice and
thick I like to slice my liver pieces
up into smaller pieces I don't want them
to be extremely thin but I don't want
them to be too thick
either if you like yours thick you can
keep them that way okay so I slice them
in half and now I want
to cut them this way so I don't like
mine too
thick I want to be about
that size this there
perfect just like
this see not too thin but not too thick
either so this is the way that our liver
pieces are looking what we're going to
do now is we're going to season our
flour and then we're going to coat the
liver in the seasoned
flour so we have a small amount of flour
here
and we're going to season the flour with
some
salt a little garlic
powder and some
pepper mix all that in
want to co our liver then this flour
and after you get done C all the liver
um shake off the excess flour and sit
the liver pieces aside
okay guys
so we're going to add a beef
broth to this measuring cup
here going to add some flour we're going
to stir that in until it's nice and
smooth
going to cut the fire on under our
pan we're going to get ready to fry our
liver
pieces want to add a little oil
it's a small
amount can't wait till this is done tear
this up I'm hungry
too let that oil you get hot for about 2
minutes let it
preheat okay so our oil was hot now
we're going to
add our liver
[Music]
okay now we're going to flip them over
I only let them fry for about 1 minute
on each side
okay okay so we're going to go ahead and
add the onions now
add our
slurry and we're going to add some beef
broth and we're going to let them
simmer
until the gravy thickens
up okay now what I like to add is a
little W sauce I'm going call it water
Shire okay just a little
bit about a
teaspoon okay guys so our liver is all
done the gravy has thickened let's plate
