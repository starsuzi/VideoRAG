hi I'm Barber Jean Bennett and I'm going
to show you how we make hot water
cornbread southern style first you have
to boil your water and it's got to be
really really hot very very hot because
it Cooks a meal and you don't have to
worry about it's done now what you
pouring this in I'm pouring it in a bowl
with cornmeal and I got a little sugar
in there because my son loves the sugar
and so that's going to cook when you put
the hot water in there we'll cook the
meal we're going to cook the meal we're
going to get in until it we get a good
thickness in it right like here oh sorry
like all over my thing that's okay but
that's what it's all about cooking so
we're going to cook the
cornmeal so how you know how what kind
of what the the measurement of the water
I said it really ain't you just when you
see when you see that all the meal is
covered because as it as the hot water
hit it it Cooks the meal except that's
why we call it hot water cornbread
because
it's basically taking care of itself
with the hot water and all we have to do
is fry it the hot water okay now this
thickness here this is what you'll need
so now what I'm going to do I'm going to
place it on on the plate platter here
and then after that we're going to fry
it so this is what you do to keep it
from sticking together you're going to
hold the water up on your hand you going
to have cold water and what you do is
you take a spoonful of your patting lift
it with cold
water and then we're going to Pat it
into a sty with the cold
[Music]
water from here we'll put them in the
skillet but right now the it's so hot
you got to use the cold water to cool it
off but you want the pat them off and
make sure that everything is about the
same size
[Music]
now I learned this from a lady in
Nashville Tennessee that I saw her doing
it like that we had a club that called
George Hall and her name was Margaret
and Margaret showed me how to put the
water together and put it on there and
have your hot water corad and so I watch
her over the years I'm not a good cook
but I watch her over the years and this
makes it come out so pretty and brown
and it keep you from burning your
hands so just like
so sou style hot water
cornbread okay I got enough here now to
put it in the skillet and you make sure
that your Skillet is hot with grease
because we don't it's already cooked
when you put the hot water in it oh we
got to turn your Skillet back up then
cuz remember I turned it back down turn
it up a oh okay and so it's already
cooked when you put the hot water in it
and so all we basically have to do is
just Brown it even hear that Sizzle we
want it hot when you put the bread in
[Music]
there there you go and I I to put one
more in
there and we'll put it
here and we're going to let that brown
on one side and then we'll turn it
[Music]
over keep cooking and the Sugar's going
to be the one that's will Mak it stick
if I didn't have no sugar and it didn't
stick but the Sugar's going to make
