hi my name is nora and i'm going to show
you
how to make a rock number
well
it's like a polisher sort of so i'm
going to show you what you need
you're going to need
a container like this one with a cap
so you're going to need a container like
this
um it has to have a cap and it has to be
plastic it doesn't have to be exactly
like this but
you can use like a mayo jar that would
be really good but
no one in my family likes mayo so
and then i've got another one
and then what you're going to need are
some rocks i just found this one outside
it's really cool
it's green
and i live in minnesota
so you can find any kinds of rocks i
like this one because it has a red
stripe and i also found that here
and
this one is really cool because it has a
bunch of lines
like you can see the layers up close
and then
this one
i thought it was cool because it was
long
i needed two because i chose
um
sort of
big rocks oh and you're also going to
need this you're also going to need
1 3 cups of sand
so it's 1 3 cups
so and you're gonna need some water
which i'm pretty sure a lot of you guys
have
so i'm gonna get going
so
no it has to be like that
no
it has to be like this okay you have to
have it like that
hold it you have to hold it
go on that side right
there no
make it slanted down like this okay
first you're gonna take your container
i'm just gonna take off the wrapper
your head you don't want to you don't
have to you don't want to but it's an
eyeless shadow okay
that's funny so that
and then now
i'm gonna
then what you're going to do is take
your 1 3 cup of sand and pour it in
well that's what wow cool
so like
this much sand
and then i'm gonna show you what you
have to do next so like that
so now
you're gonna fill it up with water here
okay
so can you hold it because i can
now i'm gonna fill this up with water so
it doesn't matter
um what the temperature temperature of
the water is
so you're just gonna want it a little
above
the height of your sand
and of course
as you can see it's sort of dirty now
because of sand
so
let's get doing it okay
sorry it's on my ipad so
oh
yeah you have that done
you're gonna put the cap on oh wait
you're gonna choose your rocks
so
if you have this small of a container
then i would suggest to
sometimes they don't fit
so you have to get a different rock
so i'm using this one
i'm using the two cool ones that i
thought were very
gonna shake cool
it's sort of loud
but
that's basically all you have to know
so
um this will take a while to do
but you have to shake it every once in a
while you can shake it whenever you want
and you just take them out when you
think they're good enough
good enough polished so
that's how to
polish your rocks
i don't know and i have a lot that are
already polished that i did
so
thanks for watching
