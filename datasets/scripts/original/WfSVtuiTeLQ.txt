all right I'm going to show you how to
do an image
transfer on plexiglass got my plexiglass
here I've got
two uh toner printed photo
copies you need use toner not inkjet
inkjet will run
[Music]
and I've got gel
medium going to take gel
medium brush it across on my
image soaking the image with the gel
medium softening
it and then going to take a little
more and place it on the plexiglass
image side
[Music]
down and I'm going to take my
braer roll it down get all the air
bubbles out so it's totally flat and as
you roll the moisture in the gel medium
is making the paper light
flat start seeing it seep through the
paper
I'm going to take this other
one hold it with the gel medium
again or jell medium on my plexiglass
and lay my paper
down
[Music]
spray and let dry now we let this dry
overnight so it's completely dry it's a
little bit wet it will it will not work
this one here has been dried overnight
I'm going to squirt it
with water on the back of the paper I'm
going to loosen the fibers of the
[Music]
paper and then I'm going to start gently
rubbing the back of the paper with the
fibers off be very gentle so you don't
remove your image
[Music]
okay I have most of the paper removed
here I could still work at this some
more if I
wanted you can let
it the transfer dry if if you see white
paper on the
background then you can squirt it with
water again and remove it till it's
totally gone but you're removing any
white paper
image that's all about the moisture and
the
[Music]
rubbing there we
go have
fun for
