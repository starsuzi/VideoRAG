hi guys redneck wannabe here I hope all
is well with you and your family today
uh so I'm trying to beat a storm
where I think a storm so you may hear
some some Thunder in the background but
you know one thing I've never mentioned
about my family and I but we homeschool
so
um so my wife well it's actually my wife
I'm the I'm the athletic director and
the fun director so
um but uh but she does man
homeschool moms they're tough they're
good so anyway we homeschool so today is
Co-op day and so my wife and the kids
are at Co-op so I am all by my lonesome
and I am bound to determined that I'm
going to get some fence put up today so
all by myself so what I'm doing is I'm
putting up welded wire fence
it's a 100 foot section it's five foot
by a hundred foot
and it's heavy and it's
it's just cumbersome it's hard to deal
with and so I'll show you what what I'm
doing and it seems like it's a little
bit easier than what I was doing I'll
try to explain all that to you so here
you go
so what I did is obviously first I I did
I put in the t-post now the welded wire
it comes in you can see that roll right
over there and I would bet it it's at
least 100 pounds
and so what I would do is I would
let me show you
let's just say the end is right here so
I would I would attach the end right
here to the weld or to the t-post and
then I would basically unravel this all
the way down
and it just took a long time it was just
it was bulky and it was hard to deal
with so I thought this time what I'm
going to do
is way over there by the greenhouse I
put the beginning and those two cinder
blocks I put on the end
and then I laid it down so it's this way
and I rolled it out
just like that
and then what I found was I thought okay
well
I'll just be able to take the beginning
there and I'll be able to put it on the
t-post but I only got I was only able to
lift
maybe to about the second t-post just
because believe it or not man it was
Heavy it's just there was no there was
no leverage so
then when I tried
was I can't I tried to come over and
just attach it to this one and then I
went back over there tried to attach it
and still there was there was too much
leverage so I just came down about a
quarter of a way
and just wedged it right in there
and that gave me enough leverage or I
guess I don't know what the word is but
it took a lot enough of the stress off
the wire that now I can actually
um
attach to the t-post and so
I think by doing doing it this way
um
probably have half of the time so most
of the time when I was just unraveling
it you know I don't unravel it over here
and then I'd have to drag it to the
t-post and I'd unravel it over here and
I'd have to drag it to the t-post
so as I started to get towards the end
of the roll it would obviously be easier
because it was lighter but the first
probably half was just it was tough
but this from unraveling it putting it
here
to wedging it on this one to attaching
the first t-post that probably took me
10 minutes maybe even less so
I still have some more fence to build
in that Garden area back in there so I
think that's what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to unravel it all and then
attach it to maybe 20 a quarter of the
way down on the t-post and then that way
that will give me a whole lot of
leverage I don't know what's uh what's
the word I'm looking for so anyway I
hope that helps and I appreciate y'all
y'all take care bye
