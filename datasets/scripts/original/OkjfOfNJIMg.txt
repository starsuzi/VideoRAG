hey guys today we're making a miniature
kitchen so I really hope you'll
enjoy first off I'm going to be using
these sheets of wood you can get these
in most craft stores or miniature shops
and if you don't have these you can also
use
cardboard first you're going to measure
out a piece that is going to be the back
and for this one you just want to make
sure you have enough room for the oven
stove cabinet you want drawers Etc
[Music]
if you're going to have this free
standing you want to add two pieces to
the sides I'm going to be using mine in
a scene later so I just put the dividers
for the oven and the
drawers but before gluing those in place
I just added a piece for the bottom and
for this one you want to make sure that
you have a space between the floor and
the kitchen
[Music]
table and once you have that you can add
the table top
next you're going to cover the front
obviously if you want the cabinets to be
working you want to add some hinges I
only wanted one drawer to be working so
I just glued them in
[Music]
place to support the one working drawer
I just glued in a piece from a skinny
stick and then I just made a simple draw
by adding three side pieces to the front
piece and a bottom
[Music]
piece to make the hole for the sink I
just used my electric file to drill a
bunch of small holes all the way around
and then used a craft knife to cut out
the
rest and of course if you prefer cutting
this out before you attach it to the
rest of the kitchen table feel free to
do it that way
once I had the basic construction I just
took some coffee stirring sticks or
skinny sticks and glued these onto the
table for extra
detail next up you want to paint it I
use spray paint but you can use any type
of paint you want and because I
obviously need mine to have some patina
I went over it with sandpaper and a file
you then want to mark off where you want
the knobs or
[Music]
handles and for these I just bent and
glued in some pieces of
wire and because I use brass wire I just
use silver colored alcohol ink to paint
it I already have a tutorial for an oven
on my channel so I'm going to be linking
that in the info box for that one I use
different material so if you're
interested in a different method check
out that
one for this one I first made a box from
wood I used filler or grout to round off
the corners and glued it in
[Music]
place to make the door I first used four
strips of clay to make the basic frame
then baked
[Music]
I then placed it on a sandwich bag and
Ed resin to make the
[Music]
glass and no need to worry if some of it
seeps out you can cut that off once it
has
set next I painted the inside of the
oven using black acrylic paint
[Music]
to make the rest of the components for
the oven I first made those little knobs
that you
turn I then added those to another strip
of clay and
baked glue that to the top and make the
handle for the
door because I already have a video on
it I'm not going to show you how I bent
the wire for the inside of the oven in
this video but as mentioned I'm going to
link the other oven tutorial in the INF
for
box you can then take the door add some
ribbon for the hinges and paint it using
black acrylic
paint and to finish off I painted the
top portion as well as the front of the
handle using silver colored alcohol
[Music]
ink to make the stove I first added four
circles to a square piece of pommer
[Music]
clay I then bent and added some pieces
of black
[Music]
wire added liquid clay to hold it in
place and baked
[Music]
I used more wire to make the rest of the
frame and glued it in
[Music]
place finally I painted it using silver
colored alcohol ink and black acrylic
paint to make the sink I first took some
scrap clay and made the basic shape used
mold putty to make a mold and then used
black clay to make the sink itself
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
glue that in place file the edges if
needed and paint it the same way you did
with the
[Music]
rest lastly I made a simple tap on facet
using a piece of wire and some
clay really hope you enjoyed and I'll
see you my next tutorial
