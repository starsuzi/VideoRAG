all right guys so uh
i went along last week i posted the fact
that i was going to go ahead and make
that meat with that uh crystallized
honey
which
i'm going to go ahead and show you some
footage from that right now
all right here's the crystallized honey
from last week
i'm going along and i'm warming it up
the way i'm doing it is i'm using a
aquarium
heater
put it about 85 degrees
so this water is going to heat up to 85
degrees
and through conduction heat it's going
to warm up
this honey
which would be
you know good to go 85 degrees i mean
this is crystallized at 73 so you can
imagine how much sugar is in it
but that's what's going on right now
once this has
gone along and warmed up enough to the
point it liquefies i'm going to go ahead
and start turning it into meat
all right guys so
yeah i continued on with the meat i went
ahead and took it out of the bucket
which had the aqua element in it the
aqua heater the aquarium heater that's
what i'm looking for
and i got it to the point where
it was soft but it wasn't liquidy
and it was still hard to get out of the
bottle i had to squeeze on and do a
bunch of stuff and it was still just
rock solid in there so finally what i
did was i set the oven at the lowest
temperature of 170 degrees
well i'll put a little water in a pan
and stuck them in there and let them sit
for about an hour
before they loosened up a little bit
they're still
rock hard i mean a little bit of liquid
came out but there was still the massive
substance in the center so what i did
was i heated up some water in the
microwave
poured it in there and then started
breaking it up little by little
now finally down to the last jug
finally got it liquefied
so this is the last of it i put it in
there it was a struggle
and also if you look in this bucket
you can see
you can see
where wherever it touched where it was
cold it hardened back up again
just rock hard
just wherever it touched
so
sweet it tastes like it feels like you
just get an instant cavity put it in
your mouth
but anyway yeah that's what i'm gonna do
now i'm gonna go ahead and mix it up get
it to
the hydrometer reading i want to do and
then i'll get back with you
all right so
you know that i've gone along and done
all that stuff you know i'm at the
ending point
and here it is
the next thing to do is of course give
it its camping tablets let it sit in for
24 hours before you know i had anything
else but that's what i'm gonna start at
staggered feeding which if you watch my
last video you'll
know you know every in eight days i'm
gonna feed it you know four times
and you know mix it up three times a day
all that good stuff
but yeah that's pretty much what's going
on here
got it all done
i'm gonna be bottling some wine here
real quick i got my mixed barrier
getting ready to go so i'll be bottling
it real soon
um
but yeah everything's been going pretty
good for me i got everything together so
i'm happy i'm able to get another video
on youtube
also i'd like to give a shout out to
oran wines

did you know i made wine here and there

see how he was doing it and i thought
you know hey i could do this you know
