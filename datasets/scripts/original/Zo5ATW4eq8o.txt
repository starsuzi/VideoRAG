- Hey everyone, it's Natasha
of natashaskitchen.com.
And today I'm gonna teach
you how to make a pavlova.
And not just any pavlova,
individual pavlovas.
It's a meringue desert
that's crisp on the outside,
marshmallowy soft and chewy on the inside,
and they completely melt in your mouth.
You guys are gonna love this easy recipe.
Start by beating six
egg whites on high speed
for about a minute,
or until you have soft peaks.
(upbeat music)
Now with the mixer on,
gradually add one and
a half cups of sugar.
Continue mixing for ten minutes,
until it's smooth, glossy
and stiff peaks form.
(upbeat music)
That looks perfect.
Now we're gonna quickly fold in
half a tablespoon of lemon juice,
and half a tablespoon of vanilla extract.
Next, add two teaspoons of cornstarch,
and mix just until well blended.
(upbeat music)
Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag,
with a large open star tip.
I'm using the Wilton 1M.
(upbeat music)
Now pipe it onto a parchment
lined baking sheet.
Start in the center,
and work outwards to make a rose,
and then build it up.
This yields about 15 meringues,
and if you use a large 3/4 baking sheet,
they all fit on one pan.
Use the back of a spoon
to create little bowls.
This gives your cream and
berries a place to sit.
Now into the oven they go
at 225 degrees fahrenheit,
for an hour and 15 minutes.
Then turn the oven off
and leave them in there another 30 minutes
with the door closed.
Once they're done,
slide them off the baking sheet,
and let them cool completely
to room temperature.
(upbeat music)
When you're ready to assemble,
combine one and a half cups
of cold heavy whipping cream,
with two tablespoons of sugar.
Beat those on high speed
for about two minutes,
or until thick, fluffy, and spreadable.
(upbeat music)
I'm using the very same frosting tip
to pipe on generous amounts of the cream.
(upbeat music)
Then add a whole bunch of berries,
and that's really all there is to it.
(upbeat music)
On to the best part of the show,
the taste test, yeah.
Outside I'm like, yay, I made pavlova.
Inside I'm like (cheers).
Okay.
(laughs)
Back to the taste test.
(laughs)
This one looks extra enormous.
(laughs)
Here we go.
Mm.
Mm.
Wow.
It completely melts in your mouth.
I love the flavor combination.
You've got sweet, tangy from the berries.
It is fantastic.
I know you guys are
gonna love this recipe.
