hi youtube today we're going to try to recreate 
this multi-family birdhouse this was given to  
me by a good friend he asked if I could replicate 
the exact same thing it's a eight family birdhouse  
it's seen better days that's for sure it looks 
like it's made primarily of pine and it looks  
like it has some cedar shingles on top here 
essentially what I'm going to do I don't have  
any plans here so I'm pretty much just gonna 
reverse-engineer it and hopefully we can have  
a pretty good facsimile I do have some scrap 
cedar lying around so I'm gonna try and build  
most of this with cedar as you can imagine you 
want a cedar type wood when it's exposed to the  
elements but the bottom piece I am going to 
use some pine I'm gonna polyurethane that but  
for the most part it's it's good to be it's good 
to be cedar so the first step is going to be to  
disassemble it and then cut the pieces to cut the 
various pieces select okay we'll get started now
what I want you to do is we want to just 
trace this out I think you could do that
[Music] yeah
okay now that we have the base cut to length I 
think the next step is we're going to take these  
lattice pieces they just go in and out of a dado 
cutting the sides of these posts here these are  
actually a little complicated this is one piece 
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use my radial  
arm saw and they put a dado blade on there this 
looks like it's about about a quarter of an inch
with the kerf that I'm gonna want to cut 
into this so I'm going to use the radial  
arm so I'm going to make my cuts 
I'm going to flip it over and make  
diagonal cuts again so hopefully we'll 
have something similar to this [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay next step now that we have the lattice 
pieces complete the next step I think I'm  
gonna make these ledges these ledges put these 
ledges are for the birds to land on before they  
they go into their to their home yeah nothing to 
this ledge here alright two two by five piece of  
cedar basically but underneath you have a a 
dado and that is to accommodate your lattice  
piece so we have to make a dado and then we 
have to cut out this two by five piece okay
[Music]
ok so I have these two pieces glued together 
and the lattice piece fits nicely in the data  
that we cut and it's going to replace this right 
here it looks pretty good looks pretty decent and  
I think the next thing I have to do is start to 
work on these columns these columns are kind of  
involved let me see if I can show you here what 
I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to cut a  
45 on top on both sides this is a 1x1 it's 
gonna be a 1x1 square piece of cedar that's  
almost 9 inches long I have to cut a 45 two 45s 
right here and then I'm gonna have to go ahead  
and and square it off right here on this side 
and again on the other side right here and then  
also I'm there's two dedos on the ends here and 
on the ends here there's two datas so there's  
there's a lot going on on this one little column 
there's eight of them so we're going to go ahead  
and get started on that now the first step is 
just to cut the 1 by 1 by 9 pieces of cedar okay
okay so as I mentioned before these 
columns have a lot going on with them  
take a look at the angles on this column 
it's not the easiest cut in addition you  
have dedos on both sides top and bottom 
this is my attempt I think it came out  
all right I think I got the math right 
and the next step is for me to put the  
dedos in and we're going to use the router 
table for that [Music] [Applause] [Music]
okay next up we're gonna take this header 
it's a decorative piece what I've done is  
I got I have eight blanks here all I'm 
gonna do is I'm gonna trace this out all  
right I'm gonna trace this out and turns 
out this whole bit this one happens to be  
two and five-eighths it looks like 
it's perfect so I'm gonna go ahead  
and take these eight blanks and go over to 
my drill press and press these out [Music]
okay so we just glued the outer shell and 
while that's drying we're going to go ahead  
and disassemble the house portion of the birdhouse 
we're gonna take measurements on the roof and on  
the sides cut those pieces of wood to length 
and then we'll start putting those together
[Music]
okay so I have four blanks here these are 
going to be the four pieces that make up  
the bracket on the bottom to accommodate a four 
by four posts and what I've done is I traced out  
the depth of this cut right here and here and 
fitted my radial arm saw with a dado blade to  
make this process a heck of a lot faster so 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put my  
blank in here I have a stop here I'm gonna 
make my cut and then I'm just gonna move my  
blank over to the right coming up against this 
stop here so this should go relatively quickly
[Applause] [Music]
okay I think we have enough here to start 
putting this birdhouse together we're gonna  
start with the dividers that I talked to you 
about me that apply wood so instead of having  
a one family with eight entrances we're gonna have 
eight family a eight family home okay here we go
okay hey guys I think we're done I I think it 
looks pretty decent at least I think it looks  
decent without having plans I will say I spent 
a lot more hours on this than I anticipated all  
told I think I'm 30 maybe 35 hours into this 
project something like this I mean I don't  
I'm not a woodworking professional I don't make 
my living from woodworking and some of you out  
there are saying well that's obvious but in 
all seriousness though I you know something  
like this I don't think you could sell at least 
I don't think I could sell just because of all  
the hours that went into it I mean you know there 
aren't a lot of people out there willing to spend  
you know hundreds of dollars on a birdhouse 
which is what you know you'd have to charge  
to recoup your your time investment but with 
that with that said I mean this was a pretty  
technical build for me these columns three 
or four different angles with dados on the  
columns as well the the lattice pieces these 
were not easy the ledges everything had to fit  
together with very very small tolerances as in 
most woodworking projects it's just that this  
this took a lot more hours than I anticipated 
again with that being said though I enjoyed  
the hell out of it I firmly enjoyed the build I 
learned I learned some things and it was it was  
a lot of fun and guys like always if you enjoyed
