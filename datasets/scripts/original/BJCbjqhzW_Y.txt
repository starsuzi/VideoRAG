hi I'm Jake from North Rock bikes today
we're going to go over how to adjust
linear
brakes the first thing to check on
linear brakes is that the brake pad is
lined up with the rim of the wheel to do
this gently squeeze the brake lever if
the pad is either above or below the rim
we need to move it to do this loosen the
mounting
nut move the brake pad
so it is lined up with the curvature of
the rim squeeze the brake lever lightly
snug the pad release the
brakes grasps the pad so that it does
not move and snug the
bolt now we're going to check our cable
tension you will know you need to add
tension to your cable if when you
squeeze the brake lever it moves more
than halfway into the grip
as you can see we're moving more than
halfway with this brake lever so we need
to add tension to the
cable to do this Slide the boot off of
the
housing and place the brake
noodle on the edge of its

housing Slide the boot off of the
housing
[Music]
place the brake
noodle on the edge of its
[Music]
housing next grasp the end of the cable
loosen the anchor bolt that holds the
cable onto the brake
arms move the brake arms so that the
pads are just touching the rim
and tighten your anchor
bolt now we're going to move the brake
noodle so that it is fully engaged in
its
housing reinstall the boot onto the
noodle now squeeze the brake lever and
you can see that it does not move more
than halfway towards the
grip now we are going to align the brake
pads so that there's equal space between
each pad and the
rim to do this we want to adjust the
tension on the brake arm Springs using
the set screw to put more space between
the rim and the pad move the screw
clockwise to put less space between the
rim and the pad move the screw
counterclockwise
in our case we need more space between
this pad and the rim so I'm going to
move the screw clockwise stop squeeze
the
lever check the
alignment if it's not yet properly
aligned turn it clockwise again and
squeeze the lever until you achieve
equal spacing between each pad and the
rim adjustment of the front and rear
brakes operate in the same way for
linear brakes before you ride recheck
that the pads are in line with the
curvature of the rim that you have
properly seated the noodle into its
housing and that there is equal distance
between each pad and the
rim this concludes the steps for
adjusting linear brakes as always we
recommend that you check the
manufacturers instructions which are
located on the support section of our
website thanks for watching and have a
great ride
