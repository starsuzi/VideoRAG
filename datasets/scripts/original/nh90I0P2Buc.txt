welcome to my first vegetable garden
today I'm going to show you how to plant
oregano and I'm also going to do
separate videos for Chives parsley and
some other herbs that you start early a
lot of times you hear start vegetables
indoors 6 to 8 weeks before you would
put them outside that's true for the
most part but what you're trying to do
is have the plant grow to a good size so
that when you put it into the ground
that season or you know that spring that
summer it will get to a maturity and
you'll be able to use it and
oregano is a very fine seed let me show
you what it looks like here's a pack
that I have
open come on
out it's very very fine and you don't
just plant one oregano seed and wait for
that plant to grow the way that I plant
a lot of my herbs oregano time is to
overseed it and I'll show you how to do
let me get most of these back in
here some plants you just use one seed
other plants you may put in lots of
seeds the method I'm going to show you
is a overseeding method and it really
works now oregano takes one to two weeks
to germinate that's not a long time but
it grows ex
extremely uh slow so you want to time
this about 10 to 12 weeks started
indoors before that it would go out into
your garden so this is something in
Maryland Zone 7 you can actually
start uh in January I'm starting it a
little bit early just to show you guys
how to to do the video this is some
fresh regano that I seed I
bought and again you can see how fine it
is I'm going to mix it with this pack
from last
year seeds can last a couple of years if
stored the right
way so here's my oregano I'm going to
do two cells
and this has
been pre moistened like I showed you in
another video and prepacked like I
showed you in another video and this
this is your first time catching one of
my videos you want to prepack the soil
this when you press down you see how
much I pushed in that's because I just
filled this once and it's too fluffy you
want to fill your cell press it down put
some more uh starting mix in and then
that makes a nice solid base for
planting but you can check out my other
videos to see how I set this up now like
I said I'm going to
overseed the oregano and the reason you
do that is oregano is extremely Hardy so
if 50 seeds grow I can break this in
half I will have two oregano plugs and
if
you trust me and try this you're going
to end up with plenty of oregano so
you're putting in about a pinch and
you're not going to be able to see it
but I'm probably rolling 20 or 30 seeds
into each
cell and they're just going right on top
and I'm going to do
two cells worth it's six and
six starting seedson door is really
great way to save money if you go and
buy just an oregano plant it's going to
cost you $3 this whole setup
to make uh to grow these 12 plants um
cost me less than $3 and each of these
plugs I'll divide in half this will
really be 24 oregano plants let me get
this seed back
into the
packet so once you have the oregano on
top you
don't want it to go too deeply down just
mix the tops up just like this some of
the seeds all fall exactly where they
need to fall that's another reason you
overseed every single seed is not going
to
germinate just mix it
in and this is how you
start your regano indoor these would
have to go into grow lights I'll have
some videos to show you how to build
some grow light stations it can go by a
full sun
window and once you mix it
in just pull the soil
in and press everything in and again
there's 20 to 30 tiny oregano SE in each
one of these
cells you can start these plants early
you want to uh drop in a marker what it
is put on the date today's the
5th see if I have another
one let me just make another one real
quick and that's my oregano now to water
this don't water the top putting water
straight on top will Splash the seeds
out what you do is you fill the bottom
of this
tray about I don't know a third of the
way a quart of the way just sit these
back in let them absorb water till they
look nice and moist on the top dump out
the excess and I just want to show you
this starting kit I got it uh Big Lots
it actually came with starting soil and
I mix that into the potting mix that I
make but for six bucks it gives you
enough to start
um six different uh trays of herbs or
vegetables and it's a pretty good deal
and it also comes with starting mix if
you want
that so I hope you enjoyed the video I'm
going to go through the different herbs
and do some more videos please check out
