hello my name is harri and this is bakas
and he has a nasty case of earmites um
probably Odes cotus according to
Wikipedia
and they're about a millimeter
long and they're gray and your ears are
full of them aren't they you poor little
critter
so what I I am about to
do is I am about to
administer some of this ear
cleaner that says it should flush out
the m and it can spread to your cats and
possibly your
dogs and of course if you have other
ferrets you other ferrets and his
brother and sister also have earmites
but it can't get to humans it can't
spread to humans which is good news it's
good news and
I think it should be noted that bacas is
a very Cooperative ferret and if your
ferret has ear mites it's not going to
be this easy and it's not easy even with
you is it huh no have some ferone here
handy I have some cotton
balls and I have lot of
Q-tips what the bottle tells us to do
to put it in to pour some of this into
his
ear all right let's get started Wuzzy so
even though bakus is a
very tolerant
and
um Cooperative fet I'm going to have to
Scruff him guess a good boy oh I know I
know you don't like having things poured
in your ears I don't either don't see
he's not
happy I'm not exactly thrilled
either it's probably best to do one ear
at a time the bottle says to massage it
into his
ear and I'll put this around his head
and let him shake a bit I think now it's
time for a little bit of
treat a little bit of ferone this is a
liquid
treat are you are you happy are you a
good boy you're a good boy
so now we're going to go in with this
Q-tip and barrets have like a little
pouch at the back of their ear you want
to make sure to get into
that and all the little crevices I
cleaned his ears a little bit
earlier
so they don't have so much debris in
them
but what we've got there little gray
things on here you can't really see it
with this camera but there are tiny
little gray things on here and those are
the
mites I know I
know remember this is this is a
Cooperative
fet all right bakas we're going to do
your other ear now okay okay we're going
to do your other
ear massage your ear it's okay it's okay
boy it's
okay I know you don't like it you don't
like it but it's going to be okay it's
going to be
okay I'm not covering his nose he's
fine give him some
treat look at those little mites bacas
we're getting those out of your
ears your ferrets don't like getting the
their ears cleaned wait till this
happens
so there's my attempt at getting rid of
ear
mits when your pets get ear mites it's
very difficult to to get rid of them we
might have to actually take them to the
vet they probably need to wash their
hammock and replace their
bedding so they don't get
reinfested so thanks for watching this
video good luck with your ferrets hope
you don't get
M
and yes peace
out
