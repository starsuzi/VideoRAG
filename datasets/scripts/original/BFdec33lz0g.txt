hello welcome to rikki's my name is
katyana and i've been a member of the
team for about eight years now today
we're going to make a chocolate martini
and i'm going to show you how to do it
best part about a chocolate martini is
that you can make it personalized for
anybody
never send out the same drink twice
however consistency is key
but it's really nice to make the guests
feel special the way i like to make my
chocolate martini is creamy it is
chocolate so i use a vanilla vodka
a chocolate liqueur
and then my base which is another creamy
godiva white chocolate liquor
i like to start by putting chocolate
inside the glass and this is where you
get to make it personal
have some fun with it make it personal
for your guest
so say there's a couple she orders a
chocolate martini so maybe i'm gonna
make it a little date night glass maybe
i'm gonna draw a little picture inside
so let's try it out
you can do something simple from a
little swirl
you can even have a little more fun with
it and write something inside
get creative have some fun with it
next
the main show
two ounces vanilla vodka
one part chocolate liquor
one part white chocolate liqueur
squirt a whipped cream for texture
and then shake it baby
now you should have a perfect decadent
creamy cocktail that anyone will enjoy
