Veria calipers the main parts of Veria
calipers
are inner measuring Jaws outer measuring
Jaws verer
scale
retainer main scale depth measuring
prong
[Music]
aim to find the volume of a small spere
cylinder Beaker and a rectangular block
by measuring its Associated
Dimensions first we have to determine
the least count of the given verer
calipers one main scale division is
equal to 1 mm one verer scale division
is equal to 0.9 mm least count LC is
equal to 1 msdus + 1 V SD = to 1 - 0.9
mm that is equal to 0.1 mm which equals
to
0.01
CM check for the zero error here no
error is visible as the zero division of
the main scale coincides with the zero
of the verer
scale
spear materials
required verer calipers and a
[Music]
spear take the verer calipers the spear
to be measured is placed in between the
outer measuring jaws and hold it tight
note the main scale reading and verer
scale reading calculation total reading
is equal to n + n into least count total
reading TR is equal to 2.1 + 7 into
01 which equals to 2.17 CM volume of the
sphere V is equal to 4X 3 piun into DX 2
the whole Cube V is equal to 4X 3 piun
into
2.17 / 2 the whole Cube which is equal
to
53476 CM
Cub
Beaker materials required verer calipers
and a beaker
take the verer calipers and the beaker
place the beaker upside down over the
internal measuring jaws and fix it
tight note down the main scale reading
and the verer scale reading calculation
TR is equal to MSR + VSR into least
count which is equal to 3.5 + 2 into
0.01 that equals 3.52 CM that is D is
equal to 3.52
CM release the beaker from the jaws of
the verer calipers and place it at the
end to extend the depth measuring prong
through the beaker till it touches its
bottom and note the MSR and vssr
readings calculation TR is equal to MSR
plus VSR into least count which is equal
to 5.4 + 8 into
0.01 that = 5.48 CM that is D is equal
to 5.48 CM volume of the beaker V is
equal to PK into d by 2 the whole s into
D that is equal to
3.14 into
3.52 / 2 the whole s into
5.48 which is equal to
53301 02 CM cub
cylinder materials required verer
calipers and a
cylinder take the verer calipers And the
cylinder place the cylinder between the
outer measuring Jaws widthwise to
measure its diameter note its MSR and
vssr
readings calculation TR is equal to MSR
+ VSR into least count that is = to 2.3
+ 7 into
0.01 which is equal to 2.37 CM that is D
is equal to 2.37
CM now place the cylinder lengthwise in
between the outer measuring jaws of the
verer calipers and note its MSR and vssr
readings calculation TR is equal to MSR
+ vssr into least count that is equal to
4.1 + 6 into
0.01 which is equal to 4.16 CM that is L
is equal to 4.16 CM volume of the
cylinder V is equal to PK into d by 2
the whole sare into L that is equal to
3.14 into
2.37 / 2 the whole square into 4 16
which is equal to 18. 343 CM
Cub rectangular block materials required
Veria calipers and a rectangular
block place the rectangular Block
lengthwise in between the outer
measuring jaws of the verer calipers and
note its MSR and VSR
[Music]
readings calculation
TR R is equal to MSR plus VSR into least
count that is equal to 7.2 + 4 into
0.01 which is equal to 7.24 CM now place
the rectangular Block breadthwise in
between the outer measuring jaws of the
verer
calipers and note the MSR and VSR
reading calculation TR is equal to MSR +
VSR into least count that is equal to
3.8 + 5 into
0.01 which is equal to 3.85
CM then place a rectangular Block
height-wise in between the outer
measuring jaws of the verer calipers and
note the MSR and vssr
reading calculation TR is equal to MSR +
VSR into least count that is equal to
2.4 + 9 into
0.01 which is equal to 2.49 CM volume of
the rectangular block V is equal to l
into B into H so V is equal to 7.24 into
3.85 into
2.49 which is equal to
69.4 626 CM cub
