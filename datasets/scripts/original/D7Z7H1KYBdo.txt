cheer Mo how Marette here this is part
two in the two-part series on how to
remove a tree stump the easy way not the
fast way but the easy way if you haven't
seen part one click here and view part
one it contains a lot of background
information on how to initially prepare
this tree stump so please view it in
today's second part we're going to
actually burn this dump now I originally
intended to put a fire ring around it
and burn this stump with some firewood
but it's it's too windy today and my
fire ring will not fit so today I'm
going to
use some
charcoal simply because it won't give
off a lot of flames and the Heat's going
to be high enough to get your stump on
fire so bear with
me we'll go ahead and prepare our
charcoal on top of this stump and see
how it goes before we get into all that
I thought I'd show you the top of the
stump it's been soaking uh for about 6
weeks and about every week I come back
and add a little more vegetable into the
Hol I've gone through about 3 quart or a
gallon of pure vegetable and I top the
hose off as needed as it soaks in there
well what I'm going to do
now just
take little extra vegetable oil kind of
drizzling on top of her
stump I'm going to lay our bag of
charcoal right on top there's nothing
special about this charcoal in fact it's
the cheapest I can find it's not the
match light I don't like the match light
charcoal simply because U it gives a
kerosene flavor to uh whatever you cook
with it so uh I always buy just the the
cheapest I I can find I'm going to lay
the whole bag on
there open it up a little
bit put a little vegetable oil on top of
that and then use some paper to try to
light it
[Applause]
we'll let it sit there and burn down
real good hopefully get a good hot burn
on top of that log and it what we're
trying to do is ignite the log
now the log or I'm sorry not the log the
stump the stump will not
burn
rapidly but we get it hot enough he'll
sit there and
smer so that's what we're tempting to do
to get hot enough to sit there and smer
and then
burn e
well this is day
two of the
burn uh it was burning good or
smoldering good last night when I went
to bed but regretfully we had a uh light
rain which uh put the fire out so here's
day two and I'm I've resorted to some um
firewood since I'm out of charcoal so
we'll watch this burn
oh this is day three we can see that uh
the stump is still
smoldering you see that or
not so what I'm going to do is take my
shovel and rake all the Ash off probably
cover it with some more vegetable oil
build another fire on top of it
and let it go
again I said this is the easy way but
not the quick way so here's proof
[Music]
[Music]
well it's day
four little stump is still
smothering looks like quite a bit of
it has smolder in too but this is kind
of is reminding me now of uh the
groundhog dating movie that Bill Murray
starred in every day is starting to be
the same so today I'm going to take my
shovel scrape off the The Ash and
rebuild my fire and let it smolder again
day five deja vu all over again it's
motoring great now so I finally think I
got it dried out so uh today I'm just
going to do the same thing I did
yesterday take my shovel Breck all the
Ash off build another little fire and
Let It Go
well this is our little log this morning
regretfully uh last night we had a major
thunderstorm come by and put down 2 or 3
Ines of water and completely soaked the
little stump and putter fire out so I'm
going to call it quits on this uh part
two just take it from me that this will
uh this will eventually work one thing
though you'll notice is this these are
where the roots
were and they've completely uh burned
out so they're way below ground level so
another burn or two when it gets really
dry then uh this little stump would have
had it you can see it's only about 6 in
tall now it turned out about
18 as an epilog or Lessons
Learned in closing uh this series
I'd say cut your stump as close to the
ground as possible it makes it dry a lot
quicker and takes fire less burning I
mean most of the stumps that I've done
this using this method have only been
that tall and they
usually will disintegrate within two
Burns and drill your hose as deep as
possible and then cover them to prevent
water from getting into the holes that
makes it uh dry out a lot quicker Burns
a lot better and then I guess in closing
don't publish a multi-art series until
you have all parts of the video done
people um don't want to wait to see the
final result this has been in uh
progress for good six or seven weeks and
people simply don't want to wait that
long to see the end result particularly
on a
DYI uh project like this so and I don't
blame them I'm the same way I want to
skip to the end and look at the final
results and and then I'll go back to
beginning if I'm still interested so
just some tips well anyhow cheer from
Ohio thanks for watching I hope uh you
found this U informational or at least
entertaining
