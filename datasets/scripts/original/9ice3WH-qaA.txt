bjbj Jan: We're in the middle of July or close
to the middle of July, and we all have corn
everywhere which is OK with me because it's
one of my favorite foods ever - ever. All
I did here was peel the husk back, and take
off the silks, and I rinsed them off real
well, and I wrapped it back up. There are
a couple of things I can do with it now. I
have a 350 degree oven back here, and I can
throw this in here for about 40 minutes, until
it's nice and sweet and tender. It is actually
going to steam in there, inside the husk,
and it's going to be fabulous. The other thing
I can do is preheat my grill and throw it
on the grill for the same amount of time.
But it's hot and muggy outside, and I'm not
going out there so we're doing it in the oven.
I'm going to throw this in and I'll be back
in about 40 minutes and I'll show you what
it looks like. And then I get to eat it. John,
Jan s brother: Hey, Kevin is moving. Jan:
Being quiet means shutting up. John: Well,
not one ingredient is drywall mud. Jan: All
right, my brother is here and he's working
on the baby's room and he won't stay out of
the kitchen and he won't hush. We've already
done this twice because he had to be smart-mouthed
and say bad, nasty, ugly words. All you do,
you give it 40 minutes. Then, without burning
your fingers too much, which, it's hot; pull
it back like this. I've seen people that were
able to tie the whole thing in a knot. I can't
do it. What I can do is find one that's still
pretty moist from the inside and tie a little
knot in it, just like that. Look! It's awesome.
[water running] Jan: Quit. Turn that off for
a second. OK. I'm not going to let you have
any more to eat. John: You didn't say 'Don't
run the water.' Jan: Shh. Quit. All right,
this is all corn needs; this is it. I've seen
people get all elaborate and they'll butter
a piece of bread and wrap it around the corn
to get the right amount of butter. You don't
have to do that. Mmm. OK, with the possible
exception of getting that smoky thing that
happens on the fire . . . Child: Mom, is the
shrimp ready? Jan: The shrimp is not ready.

I'm going to go feed the rest of my family

to break, I can tell. hxkY [Content_Types].xml
