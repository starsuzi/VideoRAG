Hello I'm Chakuza,
I'm on Munchies.
And today I'm gonna
show you how to cook,
cause you don't
shoot other people,
you cook for them.
[LAUGH] That was
a freestyle just now.
[LAUGH].
[MUSIC]
How-To Make Cordon Bleu
with Chakuza.
So today I'm
gonna show you,
how to make the best
cordon bleu in the world.
It's really the perfect
cordon bleu,
nobody else can
do it like this.
[MUSIC]
So I'm gonna start by
chopping the arugula,
then you can set it aside
and let it sit for a bit.
I'm trying to chop
without looking right
now, and it worked.
[LAUGH] Now we have
the first part of
the filling.
In the meantime,
I'm gonna get
the breading ready.
[SOUND] The first step is
to take corn flakes and
do this.
[SOUND] I hate
this feeling,
it's like scratching
ice off the windshield.
It's a mixture of
normal breadcrumbs,
shredded corn flakes,
and sesame seeds.
It's pretty easy to do,
you just have to
mix it all up.
Now let's quickly make
the yogurt sauce.
[SOUND] At home,
I obviously always
use low-fat yogurt.
[LAUGH] But full-fat
simply tastes better.
And the people
I'm cooking for
tonight should
all get fat.
[SOUND] You see?
Now I've done it.
Oh man.
[SOUND] Do you guys
have bandages?
Oh man.
[SOUND] Here's the cool
rapper that can cook,
fucking bullshit.
Then you come here,
with this finger,
what kind of cool dude
has this fucking finger?
Nobody who's cool has
this kind of finger.
Hm, hm, hm.
As soon as the thing
heals, and
I don't bleed all
over everything,
I'll get going again and
we can finish cooking.
[FOREIGN].
[MUSIC]
One week later.
So I'm here again.
And today I will try not
to cut off my whole hand.
Let's begin where we
left off last time,
with these
fucking chives.
[LAUGH]
Today I have my
own knife with me.
And today I'm being
very careful,
I'm not trying to be
the great chef anymore,
I've been humbled.
[LAUGH] It worked,
unbelievable,
I can cut chives.
And now, for
the yogurt sauce,
it's best,
I know it isn't cool for
your fitness, but if you
want it to taste good,
you gotta use
full-fat yogurt.
It's not magic, just
some chives, some yogurt,
a little bit of salt,
some pepper too.
[SOUND] But
it tastes great.
So now let's do the meat.
[SOUND] Original wiener
schnitzel is made of
veal, so we're gonna use
veal for the cordon bleu.
Of course, you always
have to start by pounding
the meat to keep it from
spraying, disgusting.
Freezer bags
are the best,
I just have normal
plastic wrap here.
[SOUND] If you don't
have a meat hammer,
you can always use
a stable knife.
When I was in
culinary school,
I used to do this for
hours with the meat.
The first semester was
either peeling potatoes,
the first semester was
either peeling potatoes,
or pounding meat all day.
I hated it.
So, done.
[LAUGH] So, next you
take sweet mustard, and
spread it all
over the veal.
Sweet mustard
is important.
In Austria,
people often add
spicy mustard to
the breading,
because it makes it
crispier, supposedly.
But if you know
what you're doing,
it's crispy this way.
[SOUND] Salt and
pepper, of course.
This is smoked ham,
make sure it covers
the length, and
let's make sure we
cover all of it.
[MUSIC]
The ham also obviously
gives it a lot of taste.
So we don't have to
spice it too heavily.
Then we spread parmesan
in the middle, and
the arugula at the end.
Arugula has a really
nutty taste.
So together with
the smoked ham and
the rest it's
gonna taste, epic.
You take it and
roll it up.
Make sure to pull it
up so it's tight.
Yes.
So now they're ready.
Now they have to be
breaded, of course.
And they need to
be breaded twice,
because there aren't
skewers in them, and
the whole thing has to
become a solid package.
You start with the flour,
dunk in the eggs,
you gotta make real
pockets out of them.
[SOUND] Then back
in the eggs,
to get a really
great sear.
[SOUND] Then press
it very lightly,
not too hard.
And voila,
there we have it.
Now we place it
on the plate.
Sorry, in Austria we have
another word for that.
Don't think I can't
speak German,
there are just
a few differences.
Now we heat up the oil,
then we pan-fry them,
then they go in the oven.
First, I have to
wash my hands.
[SOUND] This is
the optimal temperature,
you don't want to throw
them into full heat,
otherwise it'll be black
on the outside and
raw on the inside,
so it's important to
always pay attention
to the temperature.
When I was in
culinary school,
we had these dares,
we would bread our
fingers three times, and
then we'd stick them
in the deep fryer,
whoever kept it in
the longest won,
then you could
switch shifts.
If you didn't want
the night shift,
you had to stick your
finger in the fryer.
[SOUND] I preheated
the oven.
They have to
bake later for
about ten minutes
at 80 degrees.
[SOUND] Good, that's it,
that was long enough.
[SOUND] They aren't
cooked through yet.
Now they need
to drip off,
make sure the breading
isn't too oily.
Be careful, don't pat
them too hard, or
you'll lose
the crispness, and
that's the point of
this dish of course.
[SOUND] [FOREIGN]
Now into the oven.
[MUSIC]
Now, let's plate them.
They were in there for
about 12 minutes.
Let's cut this
one in half.
Yes, whoa, it's perfect.
Just gonna put
this right here.
Here we have a pimped
out cordon bleu,
with cucumber
sesame salad,
a yogurt dip with chives
and Styrian potato salad.
I did it without hurting
myself, wonderful, super.
Enjoy your meal.
