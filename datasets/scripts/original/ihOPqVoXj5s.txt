hi thanks for tuning in today I want to
show you a project of something that I
discovered while I was experimenting
with tie-dye um working with acrylic
paint
and using acrylic paints uh for tie dye
so what I want to do is just kind of
show you um how I go about it because
typically uh in a general sense you
think of putting crylic paint on a shirt
or Fabric and you and it gets hard so
this process that I'm going to show you
eliminates that so just to get started
I've already uh put up a list uh for you
of what you're going to need but I'm
just going to run it down for you real
quick you're going to need of course
your acrylic paint and I always choose
the brightest colors that you can
find um toothpicks are come in handy
lots of rubber bands come in
handy rubbing alcohol yes rubbing
alcohol you're going to need oops
plastic containers quite a few would
would be useful and helpful
[Applause]
foil and I like to use these containers
that I found um they are from coffee
creamer powder coffee creamer and I just
remove the labels and they work really
good for storing your excess color or
once you get the color um you going to
want to store it because really the
color goes a very long way so that's a
good thing and then also you're going to
want to have a few paint brushes um the
kind that I like is got it's like a
little fan um you don't have to have
this kind but it's kind of cool because
you can use paint brushes um and
Implement that into your artwork and
into your tie dye so I'm just going to
pause the tape and we'll get started so
the first thing you're going to want to
do is take your
foil and
also just to have a some some plastic
um some gloves on hand so that you don't
get your um your hands all
dirty first thing you're going to do is
line one of your plastic
bowls with the foil and you want to
press the foil down and in to create
kind of
a kind of a a cup like like a
strainer and then take your toothpick
and poke
holes all the way
around in a circular motion just like
you would like we're just making a
strainer here
[Laughter]
basically take another container
and fill that container
with the
color I'm going to use
yellow so
[Applause]
just put a bunch of paint in the bottom
of the
container and then we're going to take
your rubbing alcohol and dilute that
paint you just want to kind of do like
half and half for
starters
get your
paintbrush and mix it what you're going
to
do is dilute that
[Applause]
color and the alcohol is actually
um not working just to dilute but also
to
separate the
color from the acrylic and
oils the all the the chemicals and
particles that you'll find in acrylic
paint so basically we're just going
to get the
color and as you can
see there's a lot
of of goop on my on my brush a lot of
little particles you'll see when you do
this at home and you'll know what I'm
talking
about basically you want to get as much
color as you can out of it and once
you've once you've done this a couple of
times you can add more alcohol and
you'll get actually
more um more color and more
um I guess you could say a larger
quantity all right so we mix that up and
then what we're going to do is pour the
mixture into our
strainer
okay and you're going to
see all that residue Left Behind there's
a lot of residue in
there
whoops if you can see this okay all the
residue in
there there's residue left behind on the
foil now you're going to take this off
and and go rinse it off rinse it inside
and out come back and repeat the
process okay I have returned and I'd
like to just show you that you want to
use soap and water when you clean these
clean these out and my foil is a little
crinkled but it still works just fine
now you're going to dump your collar
back into the same container and you're
going to notice even more residue Left
Behind which is
awesome each time you do this you're
going to notice less and less residue
and you really only have to do it
depends on the paint but two or three
times is is really what it
takes oh and you want to dilute it a
little bit
each time so this would be the second
time I'll get my brush out there's a lot
of see see this this is what oops this
is what you're going to see see all that
goop that's what this the alcohol does
it
removes this from it so then that way
this is what actually is if you use this
on a on cotton or any kind of material
you're going to find that it that's why
it
hardens so yeah acrylic paint is not
usually good for tie-dye um but like I
said thanks to Sharpie pin science I
have come up with an idea that seems to
work pretty well and of course you know
whenever you're working with crafts
you'll be presented with ideas from
crafters and then you'll come up with
your own ideas well somebody will
probably come come up with an idea from
what I'm doing here um so it it's all
good it works out so again um use your
brush mix up the
color um dilute it as much as
possible usually what you'll find is if
you dilute uh acrylic
paint and you let it sit there's going
to be you know it will separate itself
um but what I'm trying to do is
eliminate what you would get from the
separation you really don't want to have
any residue in your color the less
residue um meaning you know the thick
goop that you just witnessed off the
brush um the less problems you're going
to have with it once it goes onto your
your material in your
garment I just want to say two things
that
when you use this color for
dipping and for tie dye you want to let
the color set in and dry
um okay we're going to go ahead and
strain it again you want to let it sit
and dry and then if you feel if it feels
stiff if the material feels stiff you
can just go ahead and
rub uh put more rubbing alcohol on on
that on that area and squeeze it out and
it will remove any of that stiffness and
then also to set your
color um it's a good idea to take like a
gallon of water with maybe a half a cup
of vinegar white vinegar and a couple of
tablespoons of of salt table salt in
cold water and stir that up and let your
um put your material your tie-dyed
material into that mixture and let it
sit for about an hour and in doing that
you're going to
[Applause]
um ensure that the color stays bright
and pretty for a long time okay see
there less residue than the last time
and definitely a lot
less the second time around and this is
what you're looking for when you pour it
into the Container you you don't want to
see much residue Left Behind that's when
you know that the process is pretty much
done so I'm going to go ahead and accept
that cuz I think that's a pretty
good uh mixture and I'm going to get my
plastic container
here pour the color into the
plastic and you're going to see a little
bit of residue but this was already
there from before I strained it too so
it's okay because it sticks to the to
the bottom and you're you're going to
find that just rinsing this out doesn't
work you actually have to use soap and
water to get it off so there you have it
now um again I'm going to add more
alcohol to
it and really get it
[Applause]
diluted and now I have one more
color that I can use for tie dye
okay so so far I have yellow I have like
a a greenish uh turquoise color I have
red I have pink have a sort of a purple
color and an orange
color now we're going to get to the tie
dye I'm going to pause the tape and
return
