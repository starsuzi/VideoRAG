oh look at that rice
weevils ain't that something hello this
iron hit
41 H let's say you have stored rice that
doesn't matter even if it is in myar
bags and oxygen absorbers and buckets
it's okay uh but the eggs can stay in
the rice grain up to 6 years and you
have no idea but these suckers is full
of bow Weevil larvey and but don't worry
there's no disease uh they don't spread
disease you can eat them and they don't
bite you come here they don't bite you
or sting or nothing they don't hurt a
thing I'm going to show you how to get
rid of them all right don't throw your
rice away do not throw them away even if
you even if they're contaminated use
cold water if you use hot water it's
going to kill them and they'll sink
right to the bottom then you can't get
them out but if you're not worried about
it just throw it in the pot cook it cook
bugs and all you can eat them but I know
it's just a thought I going show you how
many is in there two cups of rice I
don't know if you can see do you see
them floating oh yeah there's plenty of
them in
there but don't worry about it just keep
running water and keep pouring them out
until they're all good but use cold
water oh yeah plenty of them in that
rice there's no
disease you can actually just leave the
bugs in there and eat them even in corn
too even corn
weel oh yeah and I know y'all going to
say oh that's nasty no it ain't it's
food research it yourself you don't
believe
me how do they get in there they get in
there anywhere in the field
Manufacturing in the manufacturing
plants be
Farms don't worry about just do that a
several dozen times and if you leave a
few don't worry you can eat around
them oh yeah ain't that
something oh yeah plenty of them in
there
all right now here here's the deal about
the weevils now the larve once you open
up that that five gallon bucket and it
does get some oxygen in it that larve
will will begin it stage in it'll hatch
in about 3 days and it's going to eat
inside that uh rice kernel or corn
kernel or wheat you're going to have
them ain't nothing you to do about
it but you can get rid of them but uh in
about 18 days they'll be in uh in that
stage is what you're looking at right
now uh they live about 4 weeks and
they'll die right here in
your in your uh they'll die right here
in your rice and you'll eat them anyway
you'll eat the Lara anyway and you don't
even know you're eating it and I don't
care where it comes from whether this
rice came from China uh arkans
saw don't really
matter all right that looks like to be
all of it ain't that
sunk all righty now what I'll do is I'll
strain this because I don't want none of
this water cuz I already have my pot of
water going it's rice weevils grain
weevils corn weevils there there's no
disease you can eat them so don't be
discouraged if you go oh I got bugs in
