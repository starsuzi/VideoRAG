hello just all my friends out there and
so I decided to make my clotted cream
out of half-and-half and to use my speed
method because half-and-half is only one
dollar and 34 cents for two cups and if
the cheapest cream I can find is one
dollar for eight ounces so what I did is
I just heated it on low and as it clots
I remove it from the I just skimming off
and it put it in a bowl and then I put
the bowl in the freezer to speed the
clotting and so later on tonight I'll
have some clotted cream so I think the
half and half is gonna work out fine so
that should be let's see sixty-seven
cents as opposed to a dollar and I might
save a few calories and also my scones
are pretty small so that is my clotted
cream using half and half and God bless
you all
