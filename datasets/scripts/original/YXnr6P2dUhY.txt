today I'm going to show you how I made
these beautiful mercury glass pieces for
just a few dollars
[Music]
each first start by selecting a glass
wear you want to use you can create a
Unique Piece by binding two different
items
together
before I binded the two pieces together
I did the Mercury effect which I'll show
you in a minute on the bottom of each
one so that the center of the final
piece would have the effect
too bind the pieces together with a
really strong epoxy for
glass or you could use E6000
glue but make sure it's completely dry
by letting it sit overnight before you
do the next
steps okay so here's what you're going
to need to make your faux mercury glass
piece you're going to need kryon Looking
Glass spray and make sure it's the
Looking Glass spray because any metallic
spray won't work
you're going to need a spray bottle with
half vinegar and half
water you're going to need something to
blot the spray paint inside to make the
effect I'm using this
disposable um duster but you could use
um paper towel or you could roll up a
paper towel on a stick um to do the
blotting and that's it and you're going
to make sure um your piece is clean so
that everything will stick well um this
is two pieces I binded together it's um
I got this from Goodwill and it really
nice strong
pieces okay so I'm going to make sure
this piece is nice and
clean spray it and clean it
out also I'm only spraying inside the
glass so I could get a nice shiny
reflective look on the outside so I'm
going to take around the outside of the
piece before spraying a Looking Glass
spray paint shake the can for about 2
minutes to make sure it's well
mixed spray with light even
Strokes
after spraying a coat on the entire
inside of the piece swirl the excess
paint around slowly to help make a more
even
coat after the first coat of silver on
each side very lightly Spritz the
vinegar and water mixture on the entire
inside side
surface it'll cause the silver to Bubble
where you
spray spray both
ends then very gently blot the sprayed
areas being very careful not to wipe
just quick
touches
you're going to repeat this process a
few times spray with silver Spritz with
vinegar mixture and
blot until you get the desired look that
you
want to finish off spray one final coat
of silver and vinegar mixture and let
dry without
blotting after it's dry you'll have a
beautiful antique silver finish for your
unique glass
piece okay so my faux Mercury pieces are
done I think they came out really
nice the plate was really easy to do
because it's flat you can get a nice
even coverage with the spray paint and
Spritz it and it gives gives you a nice
um opaque look the bows and the
cylinders however took a little work
because it's round and slippery inside
when I spray it the spray paint falls to
the bottom I had to swirl it around and
it still slides down so it's kind of
transparent which is nice I like it's a
nice elegant look but if you do want it
opaque you could let that sit over night
and spray it again and do the process
over again and um it'll stick to the
paint that's there a lot better and
you'll get a nice um opaque look this
was $3 $6 for these two pieces $3 and 1
for the plate not including the Looking
Glass spray which was about
$12 this cost little to nothing to make
so I'm really excited they came out
great
