the third time I put the STS on the
wrong
way hi guys it's TAA and today I'm doing
a video on how to clean you settle so I
have two settles here today and I use
the same method on both of them have a
western saddle which is used for bar
racing and stuff like that then I have
my normal English dress saddle both
Saddles I use the same technique because
they both have the same stups and same
leathers and pretty much the same for
cleaning wise like yes the Saddles are
different but when you clean them it's
not much difference I've already cleaned
my stock saddle so I'm going to be doing
a video on how to clean my English
saddle so I hope this video helps you
and yeah
okay so what I have done is I've just
taken my English saddle off the saddle
hook because I don't clean it on the
saddle hook cuz I don't want to put too
much weight on the hook and then my
health shed would like fall down cuz
it's hanging on a
bracket I know I'm fixing it don't worry
but anyway what I've done is I've just
taken it off and put it on a saw horse
so that's how I where I put it to clean
my saddle so the things that I'm going
to be using today now some other people
might do it differently than me but this
is just my way
so some people know use like water or
warm water or whatever kind of water
they use but what I do is I just use
some oak wood leather
cleaner and I just use that because it
kind of does the same thing as the water
does cuz it you just spray on and wipe
it off kind of thing it protects
stitching and does other stuff like that
so I just use that instead of water just
in a normal spray thing and I use a Old
Rag to use that stuff and then I just
use some leather mate leather soap and
that just has a tack sponge in it so the
first thing you're going to want to do
is take your syrups off so I'm just
going
to take mine off at the moment and after
I take them off I'm going to go hang
them on my sterup sashbridal
cleaning hook okay so now that I've got
them off I'm going to go hang them on
the bridal SL stup cleaning hook hanging
from my roof
and I will show you how to clean them at
the end okay so now what you're going to
do is you're going to grab the leather
cleaner and the
rag and what I do with this I kind of do
it like you're Curry coming you do
circular little
motions so I'm going to spray it onto
the rag not the saddle I'll just get a
nice
bit and I'm going to just
spray two
squirts onto my Spong my r rag sorry and
I'm going to start from the top that's
how I normally start I'm going to do
circular motions on the
seat and I'm going to do it round here
as well and here I won't do circular
motions I'll just kind of wipe it and
then you can kind of tell when
your rag is getting drier so you just
grab
more go down
there now I'm going to do around
here I know you can see the white bits
of the soap on the saddle still but that
will go away as you can see it's fading
and with the little metal bit you can
just give it a good
scrub like
that and it's really important to get
under here and where the stups go cuz
that's where I'll get most dirty and
under the flaps is a very important
bit and now what cleaning the saddle
does is it keeps it the leather nice and
supple and your saddle will last a lot
longer okay now I'll go around do the
other side okay so now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to flip the saddle over
and I'm going to if it will
stay I'm going to spray
and do the same
thing okay so after done both sides on
the top bottom and underneath I'm going
to lift up these big
flaps and I'm going
to go all around
here oh just got my Jers it's probably
not very good
okay now I'm going to get
the fillet strap no the G
holders and getting the gths is also one
of the most important bits you want to
be really thorough when you do that so
what you're going to do is you're going
to grab it with the rag and just go
downwards with it a few times
okay so now I'm going to go around the
other side and do the same thing okay so
once you've done both sides you're
pretty much finished with the leather
cleaner and the rag until you do the
stups which I will show you at the end
okay and what you want to do then is use
your leather cleaner and I'll just open
it different leather cleaners are
different all leather cleaners are
different some you have to have open for
a while like about 10 15 minutes really
really depends on what one you have but
normally they come with instructions so
that will tell you what to do you pretty
much want it to be nice so and soapy you
don't want it to be all liquidy that's
pretty much when you know when to use
it so I'm going to grab my sponge that
came with it and yes I know it's be
funny color at the end but you know
normally is so what you're going to do
with that you're going to do you're
going to dab it in there a few times so
just so it has a beit on it you don't
want it to have too little or too much I
it's hard to you know but anyway so I'm
just going to do the same thing do
circular motions on the
seat and you're going to work your way
down again now some soaps are different
like some you'll have to wash off and
some you just leave
on it always says on it or normally they
come with instructions like on the back
or inside it cuz mine came with
instructions cuz it had like a little
plastic thing when you opened it
up I'm just going to do under here with
a bit that I can
reach and now I'm going to lift it up
again go around here then I'm going to
do the GTH holder
around here under the
G and then the
goods okay so I'm going to go do that on
the other side okay so after you've done
both sides what you're going to want to
do is flip it over
again and get all the
insides so it's pretty much the same as
what I did with the leather cleaner just
a different product pretty much it's the
same technique you do the circular
motions or you can do strokes in some
places which I'm doing now and you just
want to do a really thorough job and
after you've done using this so I don't
know if it's the same with all soaps but
this is the only one I've really used
which you normally you'll have really
sticky hands so you obviously going to
wash them off and when you do it you
want to wash the sponge off as well and
you want to do a really good job like
with warm water on the sponge so the
next time you clean your tack it's
you're not putting more
dirty like the sponge W be as dirty so
you're not putting all the dust in stuff
back on it so now I'm going to flip it
back over and there you go so that's
clean the saddle now I'm going to clean
the stups okay so now we're moving on to
the stups and the way I clean these I
have a bridal slash stup cleaning hook
that I have hanging from the ceiling and
you pretty much just hang them over the
hooks and you just it's an easy way to
clean it you just go like this with
obviously the stuff so there I just find
them an easy way to use it that was
about like $4 from Horseland I'm pretty
sure Sor I got it for a while ago can't
really remember but I'm pretty sure it's
around $5 and they're really handy so I
suggest getting one of those if you can
okay so what you're going to need when
you're cleaning your stups is the
leather
cleaner oops I just dropped my
sponge a rag the leather mate soap and
the tack sponge which I just dropped and
you're also going to need this isn't
compulsory but you can also use like a
nail filing kind of brush and to use it
on the stup so that's what I use just to
get all the dirt out around the stups
first you going to get your stups take
them off
and un Buckle
them and
Slide the stups
off I'm just going to hang them
there so I'm going to do that with both
of them okay so I'm going to grab my
leather soap no my leather
cleaner and my rag
and instead of doing circular motions
obviously you're not going to do that
two squirts again you're going to go
down the stups so my stups aren't too
dirty so I don't really need to like you
still want to do a really good job cuz
some people when they don't clean their
stups um they'll be riding especially it
happens during shows a lot I find I
always hear it happening it's never
happened to me cuz I clean my tack a
lot so so yeah what they do is cuz they
don't clean their stups or they don't
take them off while they're cleaning
it they miss bits so if they never clean
it and like they've been using it for
ages normally happens to people when
they're doing a show they'll be riding
and their stups will break so that would
be never fun to happen have happened to
me so I plan to clean my tack all the
time so it doesn't ever
happen so now I'm going to do the
besides yes so I find this hook a really
good thing to use because you don't need
to worry about holding it the whole time
and it can kind of be like annoying so
it's only like a few dollars so I reckon
it's it's definitely worth it I'm pretty
sure it's was about $5 at the most it
definitely wasn't $10 or anything like
that so cuz I saw it and I was like oh
that seems pretty handy I'll give it a
go so I got it and it really good it's
only small so it doesn't take up too
much space you just need to avoid it
hope you don't hit your
head okay so now I'm going
to do the same thing here on the other
syrups okay so once you've used the
leather
cleaner I'm going to grab my leather
soap and do the same thing so you're
doing the same thing pretty much just
going down it I'm just going to remove
these stups they're really annoying me
one of the things I like doing like why
one of the reasons I like cleaning my
tack apart from all the OB obvious other
reasin is that it always looks nice new
and
shiny and it's just fun to ride in like
cuz Everyone likes riding with like new
clothes or new saddles or bridles and
stuff so it' been pretty good riding
with like
nice saddle and stups that look nice and
new and you also do the insides okay so
the last step I do is of course clean
cleaning the stups so I take them off to
clean it what I do is I do a big scrub
where your feet
go and then I don't I go around the
stups get all the dirt and stuff
off so I've done that now I'm just going
to scrub the metal bits on my
stups and you can also do the same
with the little metal bits on your
saddle which I'll do that off camera now
okay so next you're just going to put
your stups back on so now my syrups are
back together I'm going to go put them
on the saddle okay so when you finished
cleaning your saddle and your syrups the
last thing you want to do is put the
strips back
in okay so that's how you clean a saddle
some people might do it differently than
me but this is just my way of doing it
so I hope this video helped you and I'll
see you guys next week bye
