the rescue spider traps are two-sided
plastic and they have four openings so
it's easier to catch spiders and when
the bottom of the Trap is filled all you
have to do is flip it over to keep
catching more spiders and it's hard
plastic so it's not going to be crushed
and that long narrow design you can put
it against baseboard under an in
cabinets around doorways you can put
this under furniture and appliances and
behind toilets and what's nice is it's
just an adhesive trap so it's safe it's
non-toxic and not only will it catch
spiders but any crawling insects
