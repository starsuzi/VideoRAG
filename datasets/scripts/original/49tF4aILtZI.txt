Gail going to the
dogs the dogs are back your favorite
summer drink the summer
2010 now let's say let's the caveat is
this is your favorite non-alcoholic
summer
drink right things without Jin things
that Gail drinks without Jen it's very
limited folks but this is one of them
Jessica are you buying that no I think I
believe
her Okay so um this is the iced
raspberry white chocolate
mocha um another Scout it's got white
chocolate raspberry sauce sh ice and
milk and milk okay so it's not super
complex but um we thought we'd show you
could make it for folks and and they
could see how delicioso it was Grammy
I'm shaking again I've been drinking too
many shots today so we're going to do a
half an ounce of the slurp let me see
where's the marks on here
half an
oz of the white chocolate
chocolate half an oz of the raspberry
ouch there's a little thing hanging off
the cap of this it's a biting me I love
that raspberry syrup by the way I just
tasted some when we were doing our
little test and it's like really like
it's just like raspberry jam yeah it's
yummy look at it it's a
potion mix it together so what we found
was mixing it together and the shot and
all that stuff before you put it in the
cup is a happier situation it's
happy okay okay oh no we're going to
lose some of this cuz it's going to go
on the
countertop if if it was me here by
myself I'd lick
it okay so are you going to put it in
here cuz we're going to combine it okay
going to do a flush
here get the temperature down a little
bit oh and it is summer that's why I've
got my Hawaiian
Journal we we pretending we are in
Hawaii we're yeah this is a one shot
drink
so come out a little fast but for these
purposes we're Dandy yeah it's I mean
it's going to have so much sauce in in
this
now we're going to put this in
here and if I was here by myself I'd
be like a little ant eater with that
shot get my finger down in
there a see that's nice oh I bet you
I'll bet you even like that that's
pretty yummy okay okay and so we have
ice and and how we've got 4 o of cold
milk in there yep
all
right the puppy likes it
mhm now are you ready jff to try this J
is our impartial third party testing
service do I get to drink it all you can
drink yeah in one big
slurp okay Jess made just for you I hope
do you like raspberry
no
M it's good yeah it's really good taste
it but what we need to know oh yeah is
what does the dog think let's let's pan
in what do you think little
Rue
smiling really good cat all right so
even though it doesn't have Jin in it
you still like it stop
it's very good I for myself I might add
just a little bit more milk cuz I'm not
uh I don't usually drink the real sweet
drinks this is great uh dessert dty
thing so maybe uh 6 oz of milk 5 oz 6 oz
to taste take it the recipe originally
said 3 oz and then we thought well we'll
throw in an extra ounce but what do you
think Jess I like it maybe a little bit
more coffee oh yeah cuz it's only one
shot wait a minute hold on let me put a
double shot in there and just see what
it does to it I mean we've drank a
little bit out of
it see I love this fly by by the seed of
our pants Mad Science in the kitchen
this is scientific mhm all right try
that the dog likes it the dog likes
everything that's better yeah so two
shots yeah two shots of espresso half an
ounz of white chocolate half an ounz of
raspberry try that and
uh hope none of us have any cold Source
yeah any old nasty disease is yeah
that's nice isn't that nice so now I
wouldn't change the milk no with the
extra coffee in there yeah I definitely
I I think it should be a double shot
yeah good thing I'm here that's right
well I am always suspect of of recipes
that say a single shot really
yeah much coffee because I'm like I want
to taste the coffee and usually those
are you know single shot drinks are for
pansies what was that did you see that F
she made yummy all right right thanks
Jess
thanks Gail Off to the Races folks yep
bye
