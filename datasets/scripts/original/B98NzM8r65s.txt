hi guys and welcome to cooking with
Karma now this week I thought I'd share
with you some really quick and simple
yet very tasty recipe ideas for
breakfast starting off the week with
this delicious three cheese omelette
it's a really hope you like it let's get
started and I'll show you how to make it
first up into a bowl we're going to add
in the three
eggs and the
milk then we're just going to give them
a good whisk together quite vigorously
until everything is well combined and
there's lots of nice air
bubbles we're then going to season with
some pepper and some salt and for this
recipe I'm also adding in some onion
powder then give it one final mix
together
with a pan on medium to high heat we're
going to spray that with some cooking
spray or you can use butter and then
pour in our
eggs when you see the edges start to
cook we're just going to bring those
into the
center all the way around the
pan then tilt the pan so all of those
gaps are filled up with the uncooked
egg then we're just going to leave that
and cook that for a couple of
minutes make sure to go go around the
edges with a spatula to make sure it's
not
sticking then once our omelet is almost
cooked we're going to add on the
cheese now for this recipe I'm using a
mixture of grated cheddar and
grer and some
Parmesan allow about a minute or so for
the cheese to start
melting then very carefully and I like
to do this with two spatulas we're going
to flip one half onto the other
let that cook for another 30 seconds to
a minute and then you're
done then it's time to tuck on
in cheesy fluffy and absolutely
delicious so why not try this quick and
easy omelette for your next breakfast so
I really hope you give it a go thanks
again for joining me have a wonderful
week and I'll see you all on Friday
