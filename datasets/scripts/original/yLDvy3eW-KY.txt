hello friends i am madura and welcome to
mudrasrecipe.com today i am making
eggless pancakes many times people think
that making eggless is a tedious job and
you need to run around grocery aisle to
find out all sort of odd ingredients
but today we don't have any such excuse
as today i'm gonna show you how to
prepare this eggless pancakes by using
just simple five ingredients which are
easily available in your pantry
so let's see what we need
we need very simple things i have three
quarter cup of whole milk a cup of all
purpose flour
2 tbsp melted butter
2 tbsp sugar
4 teaspoon vanilla
and half teaspoon inno fruit salt
i'm gonna start by sifting all purpose
flour just to make sure to get rid of
all lumps from it so take your flour
into a sifter
save this
after this is done
next in here goes sugar
and milk
and mix this very well
next i'm gonna add melted butter
and vanilla
and adding vanilla is optional
now give this a good mix
and finally i'm gonna add in a fruit
salt to this you will find this inner
fruit salt at any indian grocery store
now this inner fruit salt gives light
and airiness to the pancakes
give it a good mix
and after this batter is mixed up very
well give this a standing time of 5
minutes
all right now let's start to make
pancake and for that you need to preheat
your frying pan over medium to high heat
and i'm gonna grease this by using some
butter you may also make use of oil
add enough butter
and next i'm gonna add a ladle full of
batter over it
that's it
and you want to cook this right till the
time you say lots of bubbles starts to
appear on the surface of this pancake
that looks nice and bubbly now give it a
quick flip
and let this cook from other side as
well
that looks good
now just take this out into serving dish
and there we go this eggless pancakes
