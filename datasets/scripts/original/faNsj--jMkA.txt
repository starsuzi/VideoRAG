Hello. Hi. This is J.B. with Austin Homebrew
Supply here in Austin, Texas. Today we are
talking about wine making equipment. Particularly
right now I would like to talk about bottle
drainer trees. This is an example of a bottle
drainer tree that I'm standing next to. The
tree would consist of the base itself; this
guy right here. Then these red interior parts
are the actual arms them self. You would stack
these up. So, what I personally do when I'm
getting this guy ready to go is set the base
down. Then you take the interior parts, the
arms, and you just immerse them into some
sanitizing solution. Then you build up the
interior so that these guys are already sanitized,
so that after I take a bottle and I sanitize
it. To drain it out I can invert it and put
it on this already pre-sanitized drainer tree.
Invert it like that. The guy drains out and
once it drains out; it doesn't even have to
drain fully, but you want to drain out most
of your sanitizing solution. Then once it's
drained out then you would just simply take
it off and fill your bottle and cork it. So,
bottle draining tree is not anything that's
mandatory, but it's really, really handy.
It really helps on bottling day to be able
to invert your bottles like this and drain
them out. So, bottle drainer tree; very handy.
