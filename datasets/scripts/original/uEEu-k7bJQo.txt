i'm using leftover panettone to make a
delicious bread and butter pudding i've
got some slices here i'm just going to
cut them in half to make them a little
bit more manageable
and then pop them straight into a
buttered oven proof dish i'm just using
classic lightly fruited panettone but
you could use any sort of sweet bread
you could use cinnamon and raisin or
pano chocolate
now for the custard i've got some beaten
eggs to that i'm going to add some whole
milk
for the full recipe just click on the
link in the description
some double cream
and i've got some demerara sugar i'm
going to put about half of it in now
and keep the rest for the top
and i'm just going to pour that quite
evenly
all over the panettone
and then you need to leave it to sit for
about 15 minutes and that part's really
important because it gives the panettone
a chance to soak up all of the custard
and then you'll get a really really
lovely texture
now to finish off the bread and butter
pudding i'm just going to sprinkle the
surface with the rest of that sugar and
it'll give it a really lovely crunchy
topping
and then to finish it off just a little
bit of freshly grated nutmeg
now i've got a roasting tin in the oven
that's got some boiling water in it
i'm just going to very carefully see our
dish inside the tin and that'll help it
to cook really really gently
and that'll need to cook for about 35
minutes until it's completely set and
lovely and golden
