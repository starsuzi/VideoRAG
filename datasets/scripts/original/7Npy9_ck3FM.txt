How to Make Muesli.
Homemade muesli is cheaper, healthier, and
tastier than store-bought.
Plus, you can customize it to your taste.
You will need 2 to 4 c. of rolled oats Large
mixing bowl Seeds, like sunflower and pumpkin
Dried fruit Chopped nuts Airtight container
Bran, rye, or wheat flakes Barley kernels
Chocolate chips Coconut flakes Mini marshmallows
Milk Fresh fruit Ice cream Yogurt and cottage
cheese.
Step 1.
Start by putting rolled oats, the basis of
most muesli, into a large mixing bowl.
Add seeds, dried fruit, and chopped nuts – the
types and quantity is up to you.
Consider adding nuts just before you eat a
serving, since nuts go bad quickly.
Step 2.
Add whatever else you like – bran, rye,
or wheat flakes; barley kernels; chocolate
chips; coconut flakes; or mini marshmallows.
Mix everything together.
Step 3.
Store the muesli in a large, airtight container,
like a glass jar with a lid, and store in
the fridge.
It will stay fresh for up to two months.
Step 4.
Grab a handful for an on-the-go snack, put
it in a bowl and add milk and fresh fruit,
or use it as a topping for ice cream, yogurt,
or cottage cheese.
Or invent your own favorite way to eat muesli.
Did you know Muesli was introduced around
1900 by a Swiss physician for his hospital
patients.
