Preparing crispy, flaky phyllo shells is easier
than you think.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Lay one sheet of phyllo on the work surface.
Spray lightly with cooking spray.
Repeat with seven more sheets of phyllo.
Lightly spray a 4 ounce muffin pan.
Cut the layered phyllo into four rectangles
and press into the pan.
Layer four more sheets of phyllo, spray lightly.
Cut the layered phyllo in half horizontally.
Stack the two halves on top of each other.
Cut the stacked phyllo in half to create two
rectangles.
Press the two rectangles into the muffin pan.
Lightly spray the top of each shell.
Bake the phyllo shells for about 10 minutes
or until lightly browned and crisp.
Fill the shells with one half cup of an appetizer
or dessert filling.
Serve immediately.
