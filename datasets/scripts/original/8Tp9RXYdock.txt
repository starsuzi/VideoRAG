I'm going down to the house of sausage I
got my barbecue shoes
on going
Theus got my
[Music]
barue welcome to
bbqpitboys.com today we're making up
some bacon steak kebabs on the all right
this is real easy to do here I've got
about a pound of uh thick cut bacon this
is American style uh pork belly bacon
it's thick cut and we're going to uh
partially cook this bacon first here
before we start putting our Kebab
together all right now here I've got a
nice piece of beef steak this here
happens to be a what they call a London
broil or
or top round steak and here I've got
some uh bell peppers and here I've got
some
onions got some garlic powder I've got
some thyme that's a crushed thyme there
got some red pepper
flakes here I've got some good oil and
there's some Wier Shear
sauce got some red wine
vinegar and I got my favorite spices a
little coarse of salt and black pepper
and uh here we've got about foot long
wood skewers all right let's put this
[Music]
together man there's nothing like beef
skewers on the grill man you got to
check this out so let's get going here
by uh cutting up this uh steak into
about inch and a half
cubes now that's kind of easy to do now
you can have your butcher do this for
you but uh you can save yourself some
money just buy yourself a nice piece of
steak and cut them up
[Music]
yourself all right I really don't need
to show you much of that just about inch
and a half cubes of
[Music]
dup
is
good now because this is a u this here
is a fairly tough piece of meat what you
want to do is marinate it and uh
especially want to do this with a top
round steak or bottom round
steak or even a sirloin
steak we're going to marinate it for
maybe a couple
hours
and to do that we'll throw about a half
a cup of uh good oil here it could be
olive oil canola
oil and to that we're going to add about
4 tablespoons of wierer
sauce and here I'm going to use a about
to about one teaspoon teaspoon and a
half of garlic
powder I'm use about one teaspoon of
crushed
[Music]
Thyme and here I'm going to use about 1
tbspoon of red pepper
flakes now of course you can uh add your
own spices
make it your own but this works real
well you got to check this out and then
to uh to this we're going to add about
1/4 cup of what they call red wine
vinegar
Here regular vinegar go D and here I'm
going put about a tablespoon of coarse
black pepper and
salt all
[Music]
right now you want to marinate this at
least an hour hour and half you can go
four to
six now if you're using a good riy steak
or something like this of course you uh
you won't need to marinate it long this
will help tenderize it so we're going to
put it back in the cooler
here now let's get these uh veggies cut
up want to check this bacon first here
we're going to flip it
like I said you only want to partially
cook
this man it smells
good clear off the
table all right now let's cut up these
veggies now here I'm using some red bell
pepper you can of course use green bell
pepper if you want or if you don't like
bell peppers you don't have to use it
this will give you a couple
ideas then you want
to cut up some onions into some
[Music]
wedges now you know all about that I
don't have to show you
this
you want to make about inch and a half
[Music]
wedges now these bacon steak Bobs Go
real good tailgate family
picnic bring out a plate full of these
kebabs you're going to have a lot of
people want to come over your
pit
[Music]
we'll do the same here with the
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
onion
[Music]
all
right time to pull this bacon off the
grill now the reason we uh like to cook
our bacon up first give it a little
smoke is uh because the steak cook real
quick in these skewers
so uh we get we get started early with
the baking adds a nice flavor and ends
up nice and crispy with the
steak all right now this uh steak has
been marinating for a
while and uh maybe 2 hours like I said
you could maybe go four to six if you
want depends upon uh what kind of steak
you got here all right now we're going
to take some of these uh slices of bacon
we'll wrap them around a piece of
steak slide it on the
skewer now we'll take an onion
[Music]
wedge do the same thing
grab one of these pieces of bell pepper
here and just repeat the process over
and
over it's about the most difficult thing
of doing this
recipe man are you getting hungry or
what
[Music]
all right got one
skew and then we're going to place it of
course opposite the hot coals and we're
going to be running a temperature in
this Grill about 300°
fahr
[Music]
you do it this way they'll come out
moist and tender every
[Music]
[Music]
time
I think you get the idea how this is
done real
easy and when you're doing these uh
kebabs uh opposite the hot coals you
don't need to pre-o your wood
skewers they'll just do fine just like
that all right now this will be about 20
minutes maybe 25 300° Fahrenheit like I
said now we're about halfway through
this maybe 15 or 20 minutes this is
where I'm going to come in and uh rotate
these
kebabs just to get a little more even
cooking going on
here man it smells
good all right about another 15
minutes
all right through the miracle of time
these bacon steak kebabs are done hey
