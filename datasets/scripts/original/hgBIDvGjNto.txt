It's hard to find a good hamburger
relish so I thought I would make my own
and wow it turned out delicious!
Welcome to my kitchen and I will show
you how easy this burger relish is to make.
 
So let's get started...
In a saucepan on medium heat I am adding a couple tablespoons of butter, some finely
minced sweet onions,
I'm using Vidalia onions, and some salt
and pepper.
I'm cooking that for about one minute
just to sweat out the onions.
And this next ingredient is optional, I'm
adding a little heat.
I'm adding a half of minced seeded
jalapeno.
Stirring and cooking that for an
additional minute and then adding 2 to 3
cloves of minced garlic. Stirring that
for 30 seconds and then we'll be ready
for the tomatoes!
Next I'm adding about
a cup to a cup and a half of fresh diced
tomatoes and letting that simmer for
about five minutes until the tomatoes
fall apart.
The amount of liquid depends on your
tomatoes and as you can see mine did not
have much liquid so I may add some water later.
I'm adding a quarter cup of red wine and
a quarter cup of brown sugar.
I'm also adding one healthy tablespoon
of paprika, stirring and simmering for
about two to three minutes.

I'm adding 1 cup of finely diced
roasted bell pepper.
You can roast your own but iIm using
some out of a jar.
I'm also adding a quarter cup of chili
sauce and a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.
 
Give that a good mix around and let that
simmer on low for about 15 minutes.
Keep an eye on the relish. You can see my
liquid is mostly absorbed and you may
need to add a little water along the way.
I did add a quarter cup water.
We're almost done! Next I'm adding 1
cup of finely diced sweet gherkin
pickles and a teaspoon of cornstarch
slurry. You can use the tihickening agent
of your choice.
Giving that a good mix and bringing up
to a boil, letting it simmer for 1 to 2
minutes and then taking off the heat.
Let the relish completely cool and
refrigerate in a lidded container. I would
say you can keep refrigerated close to a
month.
This is a delicious condiment for your
burger. It has the flavors of sweet,  sour and spicy!
