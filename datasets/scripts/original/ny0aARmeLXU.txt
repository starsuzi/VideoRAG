Hi, Lenny Gale, Life is NOYOKE.
If you want to make a Chicago resident feel
right at home,
all you gotta do is feed him a Chicago-style
hot dog.
But don't feed him this sweet relish.
Give him something that's delicious and healthy.
My recipe for sweet, simple relish.

Do you even know what goes into sweet relish?
I had no idea.
It's basically cucumber, vinegar, sugar and
salt.
But this one has a whole bunch of extra crap.
High fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors,
artificial preservatives, and artificial colors.
Feh!
Aright, I get what you're thinking.
This doesn't seem like something that's even
remotely worth making on your own.
You can just buy a bottle.
Well, I'm gonna show you that it's incredibly
easy, there's very few ingredients, and it
tastes so much better.
Let's get this out of here.
So here's what we're gonna do. So easy.
Start by adding some apple cider vinegar.
There's measurements on the side of the Vitamix,
so I know.
Two tablespoons of salt.
Instead of sugar I'm gonna use stevia.
And then we're gonna use cucumber.
Chop it onto golf ball-sized pieces. Drop
'em in.
And then just a tiny it of cabbage.
Because that's actually a sneaky ingredient
that was on the back of that nasty-looking bottle.
And that's it!
Put the cover on. And we're gonna blend on
variable speed one and pulse it for about
10-15 times.
I'm also gonna use the tamper to gently push
the ingredients down into the blade.
And that's gonna give me a little bit more
control and efficiency
to help me get the desired texture that we're
looking for.
The relish texture!
[blending]
Mmm! That's yummy!
Mmm!
[coughing]
Shalva: [laughing]
Lenny: It's so vinegary.
So you can use plain vinegar instead of apple
cider vinegar, too.
But we're using the apple cider vinegar because
it's a little sweeter
and there's some definite benefits with that
kind as well.
Also, that was the only kind in your cabinet.
And we improvise like that.
Since there's a lot of liquid, we're gonna
put if over some heat to let it reduce.
That way, it's going to thicken a little bit
and the flavors are gonna mix together.
Come on! Come take a look!
[sizzle]
You can see how the texture is just perfect relish.
Tiny little pieces, evenly chopped up.
Perfect to be put on a hot dog.
Does that look nice?
Shalva: Nice!
Lenny: It looks very nice.
Okay, with this wonderful relish, if you want
a little sweeter, you can add some honey.
If it's a little too liquidy, you can always
drain some of the vinegar.
And be sure to put in the fridge before you
serve it so it's served cold.
Now, two more things.
Veggie dogs are a pretty darn good substitute
for a regular all-beef frank.
That's what this is.
And the second thing, what all Chicagoans
will tell you,
don't serve your hot dogs with ketchup!
But if you are, people, I'm still proud of
you. Life is NOYOKE.
Mmm. Look at that relish. Look at that! That's
the most beautiful relish I've ever seen.
And you know what? It's not neon relish.
But this relish is frickin' amazing.

Mmm! That's really good!
Shalva: I like it when you're surprised when
your food's good.
Lenny: Me, too. Thanks.
Shalva: Geez!
Lenny: Mmm. I'm hungry. It's a good thing
I did that in one take.
Cause you can't, like, add the dog back on.

I'm getting a phone call. It's Dad. Hello?
Dad: Hey, boker tov.
Lenny: Hey, can I call you right back?
Dad: Yeah! You can.
Lenny: Okay.
