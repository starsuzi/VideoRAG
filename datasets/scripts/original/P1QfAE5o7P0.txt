so I want to show you how this
comes it does come with its own tape
which is pretty cool because um the
department stores don't sell it with the
tape and it comes with all the plumbing
features that it needs you got your
hoses it also comes with a little
instruction booklet in case this is your
first time installing a faucet it walks
you through the important
steps and the most important piece of
all and this is a really really solid
piece and so I set up my scale here just
to record this it is over 2 lbs of solid
metal and you can see there this is
serious
piece it is not Hollow it is solid and
it feels solid so I'm really happy with
that I love the
long narrow space here and the
bulb that is really pretty
too right down into the base very pretty
I think this is a very stately
piece one thing I love is underneath
here you got these lovely little finger
notches and I don't think it's really
meant to do anything other than just
feel good and look
pretty really happy with
it
