this is mom Cedric and you see me just
how to make Mohammed today which is
something similar to a sopapilla except
it's making the yeast instead of baking
powder first use flour she's measuring
it that's probably about this is maybe
two cups
four cups four cups of self-rising flour
all Senate business all by I she doesn't
measure really she's doing two measuring
today this because we're learning sugar
and that is 3/4 of a cup of sugar so
about a half a teaspoon of yeast notice
she's just waiting putting it all
together she's not dissolving her yeast
some people does alter these it's like
about 3 tablespoons two to three
tablespoons of Crisco in America
then she mixes it all money this is milk
we don't have milk in a jug well you can
get milk and jug in my Ruffy bed so she
probably used about each packet is 2
cups of milk so at least 1 cup maybe a
little bit more by the way mama said you
can talk she's very shy but she doesn't
know English she prefers so ideally ok
so now you start kneading the dough
you okay so now that goes ready ooh
knock GOG
I guess she just feels it okay so when
you just feel it then your nose ready
when it's soft
that's enough oniony me so we cut small
pieces like this this is just getting
the dough ready and then later we'll
cook it now I think I said you
self-rising flour it's not surprising
Clark just for the other flour and so
now we're almost done all right honey
okay there's know what to call this we
did she just threw the little flour and
makes pinches video on the bottom to
make a nice little ball
and then you just put a little tray or
in a bowl
and they are just gonna sit there until
they're ready to cook
can you noisy cool because less than you
okay bye buddy yeah buddy if you can
that me okay so after about two hours
you can cook them or you can wait longer
if you want to but you need at least two
hours so let the dough sit and rise and
then you can cook the dough after two
hours which will show you that second
step when we're ready to cook them later
all right they're ready to roll out
so mama Cedric will show us how to roll
the Mohammed
she rolls them in a big circle
now they're ready to press
I'm learning too
okay you can also use instead of regular
milk you can use coconut milk which you
can buy in a can in I don't know where
you can find it in the store but I know
they sell it in a can in the States so
you can use coconut
so the grease is hot we're ready to fry
them you can use any kind of oil
this is sunflower oil
doesn't take very long
see they puff up like magic makes a nice
little pocket inside the middle
all right so here cool is there hot this
is what it looks like on the inside
they're really really good
you can even buyers by itself they eat
them sometimes with tea for breakfast
you can put beans inside a little pocket
or just eat them you know with your
beings or
