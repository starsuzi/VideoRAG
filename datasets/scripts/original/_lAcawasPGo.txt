hey everybody today on Henry's hatos I'm
going to show you how to make garlic
chicken balls let's get straight into it
so just in front of me I've got 500 G of
chicken breast mints now to this we're
going to add 1 teaspoon of
salt 1/4 teaspoon of ground
chili about half a teaspoon of paprika
some Cracked
Pepper about two crushed garlic
cloves and just crack in one
egg now what we need to do is just mix
this together and get it will
combine now we're going to add some
breadcrumbs to our chicken mins what
what I'm going to add is panco
breadcrumbs these are very fairly used
with all sorts of Asian food and they
provide an amazing crunch but you can
use normal breadcrumbs so I've just
started off with two tablespoons of it I
like to gradually work it in like I
always say the love is important in food
that's where the flavor is now go ahead
and add in another two
tablespoons and we'll mix that through
well so we'll go ahead and add in
another
tablespoon and work that through as
well and now it's time to come back
together like a nice
bow
so we basically want a consistency like
this now we'll leave our Min aside for
now and what we want to do is get some
salted butter and we just want to slice
it into very small pieces like that and
again so we got very little
cubes so now bring your chicken Ms back
and just in your hands you want to
create a small wall like
so and that's about a tablespoon of our
Min now just create a small dimple like
so and you want to get probably about a
few pieces of the bottle like that put
it into the
hole close it back
up and just roll it against it back into
a wall and just set that aside so we
want to repeat that process with all our
mins now if you have any butter left
over after and you've touch it on this
board ensure you don't use it because
obviously it's been contaminated with
raw
chicken and we definitely want don't
want to create any
problems so just try and use as what you
need so guys just continue repeating
that process until all your mint is
done so Al together I've managed to
bring out 15 chicken balls so just set
that aside
now and you want to bring across a bowl
again and add in about one cup of your
breadcrumbs and all we're going to do
now place the ball straight in give them
a good coating like
so and then place them onto a
tray and just continue repeating the
process so you should end up with
something that looks like this now we're
not going to cook these yet place these
into your fridge and you want to put
them in there for at least 15 minutes
just so the me can combine back
together so I just left mine for about
half an hour I was in no rage so preh
hit your deep fry to about 170Â° C you
can pan fry these or bake these if you
prefer but personally I like everything
fried so it's up to you so once your
deep fres is ready go ahead and place
your ball straight into the basket try
to leave a little gap between them so
they don't stick straight
away now you may need to do this in two
or three batches depending on the size
of you take
Dr just like so and put the basket
straight
in
now as for cooking time we're looking
between 3 to 4 minutes we definitely
want this cooked all the way through
that's very
important and just look for the golden
brown
color and they should be
fine so guys after about it's been about
3 and 1/2 minutes now as you can see
they're all starting to float off that
generally signifies that it's
ready and you can tell they're nice and
golden brown so what we're going to do
is bring the baskets
out and just let it rest there for a few
minutes you want to drain as much oil as
you can in the meantime line a bowl with
some uh paper towels just so we can
drain the excess
oil and just go ahead and
put
you can even hear that nice
Crunch and just season them with a pinch
of
salt and now we're ready to serve
these okay and there we have it how
perfect the they look and of course I'll
show you guys what they look like
inside
how perfect is that so what happens is
the bottom melts and they get nice and
moist and they stay
moist just simple as that and guys if
you want you can make these in a smaller
size so they're more of a cocktail thing
and obviously they'll cook quicker but
that's just up to you it's the same
recipe just make them smaller I hope you
like that guys please like And subscribe

you all next time
