so here's a look at one of my Gooseberry
bushes I have two of them this one
actually I've only had for a year I I
bought it from a Gard Center and
clearance and it's done really well just
full of
gooseberries as you can
see and then I have that crazy Branch
just full of them and they are just
starting to ripen uh and somebody asked
me a little while ago how do you know
when they're ripe cuz they don't always
change color you can let them sometimes
uh go all the way till they're full red
but if you have bugs like 99% of the
population you don't always want to pick
them when they're fully ripe uh they're
pretty sweet now now the trick I go by
once any of them get even a little bit
of frosting of of red they're pretty
sweet pick this
yeah that's
sweet you can let them
go a little
bit more red but personally I don't let
them go much more red than this because
at that point the birds start eyeing
them up and you can come back one day
and you'll get none and that's happened
to me lots of times between all these
types of uh Gooseberry bushes
and I'll just show you my other
one now this plant here it's an older
plant it's a bit bigger and bushier I
can't say that it's yielding much more
than the other one well
maybe but yeah you can see this one
seems to be sweeter and maybe that's
just cuz it's older I don't know
yeah that's really sweet considering
they're still
uh colored and then occasionally you'll
see one like
this when you see one like that and then
the rest of them are all green be really
suspicious you know when you pick it
take a look you can tell that a bug got
in there and that made it sort of ripen
or rot or whatever you want to call it
so that one I'm not going to be eating
that one I'll just throw it away
yeah this one has
little light frosting of red on
it I would probably
wait I don't know if the camera can see
that yeah so I would probably
wait another week before I just picked
all of them uh most of them I taste are
sweet unfortunately I have enough that I
can you know sample some here and there
uh but I think I'm going to
wait another week uh I'll taste probably
five or 10 of them and if they're all
sweet I'll pick them off that's what
I'll do uh I don't want the birds to get
to them Birds just love these or
whatever other animals in the middle of
the night you know just they pick these
things clean um I think the only good
thing is these have thorns very big
thorns and I think that keeps out some
of the pests but the birds they don't
seem to
care so that's how I uh choose when to
harvest my gooseberries and look at how
they're
growing and hope you enjoyed thanks for
watching
