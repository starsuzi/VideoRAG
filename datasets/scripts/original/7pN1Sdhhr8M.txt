we're going to do a sunny side up egg
here's our eggs here little pan spray
for our non-stick
pan some salt and some pepper to season
it
with your pan nice and hot over about
medium give it just a little bit of
this just to help it not stick to that
non-stick
surface now the side up egg is the least
the least cooked of all the egg
preparations essentially you're just
going to crack the egg into the pan let
the proteins that are touching the
surface of the pan
set much like
this always crack your egg on a flat
surface
so the Sunnys side up egg doesn't get
flipped at all hence the name Sunny Side
Up the yolk representing the sun being
on the
upside a little bit of
salt and a little bit of
pepper so once the the whites the
protein and the whites have coagulated
and the Egg slides freely in in the
pan you'll let it go for a little bit
there should still
be a
semi-transparent portion of the white on
the surface the yolk is basically
raw just like
that sunny side
up
