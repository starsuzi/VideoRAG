it's called the Bailey's chocolate
martini and surprise surprise it
contains Bailey uh so it's a pretty
straightforward cocktail just three
ingredients so we're going to start with
75 o of creme to Cocoa so there's a lot
of cool crem to Coco out there on the
market uh I'm using her walker it's
probably the most uh readily
available so you shouldn't have a
problem finding it in the store but
Marie bizard makes a really nice
chocolate uh so you can check that out
as well okay so we got 75 o of our cocoa
in there now we're going to do 75 o of
our
Bailey's Irish
Cream there we
go and this one the uh cocktail uh book
specifically calls for Bailey's so you
know you can get it you can find it it's
easy to find um now we're using 2 ounces
of vodka so this cocktail will make you
happy uh 2 O of vodka we're going to use
yaka Vodka it's a French
vodka but feel free to use what uh what
you dig so we got 2 oz
here all right we going to ice up our
glass
and we're going to give it a
shake and as always you want to wait
till that tin is kind of Frosty on the
outside but you know you got

temperature all
right we're going to strain it into our
pre-chilled cocktail glass

Hershey's
Kiss so we can either drop that right in
the bottom fun surprise after you're
done drinking you know or you can uh put
it on a pick with the uh you know with
the trademark silver and the Hershey's
