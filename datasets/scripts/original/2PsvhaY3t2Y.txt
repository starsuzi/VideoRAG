How to Make Corn Dogs. Make corn dogs just
like the ones at the county fair by following
these simple steps. You will need 1 qt. vegetable
oil 1 c. flour ¼ tsp. salt 1/8 tsp. pepper
¼ c. baking powder 1 c. cornmeal 1 c. milk
1 egg 16 hot dogs Deep saucepan Food thermometer
Tall glass or mason jar and 16 wooden skewers.
Step 1. Heat the oil in a deep saucepan to
365 degrees. Step 2. Combine all the ingredients
in a mixing bowl. Stir the ingredients until
the mixture is smooth; then transfer some
of it to a tall glass or mason jar. Step 3.
Insert the wooden skewers into the ends of
the hot dogs. Dry the hot dogs with paper
towels so the batter will stick. Step 4. Dip
the hot dogs in the batter in the glass or
jar, shaking off the excess. Refill the glass
as you go. Step 5. Deep-fry two to three hot
dogs at a time until they are golden brown,
about 10 minutes. Remove them with tongs and
place them on paper towels to drain. Serve
them warm, but don't eat too many before you
go on the rides. Did you know According to
Guinness World Records, as of 2008, the longest
hot dog on record was 375 feet.
