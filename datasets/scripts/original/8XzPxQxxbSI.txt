how's it going everybody so today we're
going to talk about how to clean the
flute
so today we're going to talk about
cleaning the flute how you clean it the
exterior of it
um when you get little brown spots or
you get a little bit of tarnish or if
you you know it's generally a little bit
dirty now there's two ways
of cleaning there's the regular tarnish
cloths which look a little bit like this
they usually have these little brown
little markings on it because it
removes tarnish and then there's the
polishing which is this microfiber type
of cloth that you can get
you might have both of these inside your
case you might not you might have one or
the other but we're going to go through
uh both of the ways to use them so we'll
start with the tarnishing cloth tarnish
cloth you want to start on the
tarnishing side if you want to find out
which one's the tarnishing side just rub
a little spot where you see some
some gunk
and see if it rubs off if it does that's
the tarnishing side of the cloth so you
want to take
your
head joint
and clean a little bit at a time in a
circular motion
around try not to get the the core try
not to get the crown here
clean the inside a little bit with your
finger a little mouth hole
and you want to just go in little
motions like that
and usually that gets it nice
and shiny again
pretty much nice and shiny again
and get to a certain level you don't
have to do it too much just a little bit
here and there don't overdo it
at all as you can see look at that extra
tarnish that just fell off off of it
now with keys
it's a little bit more tricky what you
want to do with keys especially is not
to go rubbing side to side like this at
all if you're going to rub the keys at
all you want to rub
back and away so
this way then that way not this way or
this way
because you don't want the small
mechanism to scrape back and forth and
then cause a lot of play and then make
your flute go into repairs a lot faster
so you want to do that just back and
forth
and then back and forth
and back and forth don't press it down
too hard on the keys just very gently
just as you would if you were playing on
the flute just a little bit
and then clean like that same here
around the g key g sharp key same thing
just lightly
press on it try not to clean too much
over the uh
over the uh
or the ribs and all the piping here just
lightly go over it it doesn't need that
much at all just lightly go over that
and then the other side of the keys now
the tubing same thing as before
on the head joint just rub nice and
on it
over and over get all that black
gunk off of there
and yeah that's how you use the tarnish
cloth pretty much
and
just go over it with that on the tarnish
cloth then you take the car's cloth away
and you're done with that
now with the polishing cloth it's quite
it's usually the more daily
type of
cloth that you should use that generally
just gives it a nice little shine again
nice little clean doesn't necessarily
take off any tarnish but what it does is
just just cleans off all that gunk
that's on the flute
and it's very very
useful little item to have feels good
too when you're when you have it in your
hands
and cleaning it like that and it gives
it a nice little shine keeps it all a
nice
nice good working order no debris around
the pads stuff like that
same motion again always going this way
and not that way when you're when you're
cleaning the keys so i hope that was
helpful if that was helpful let me know
down in the comments be sure to like the
video if you liked the video and let us
know down in the comments what other
video we can do about maintenance for
the flute
until next time guys thanks for watching
