hey YouTube It's cyber waast again uh
well today's the day today's the day I
get to show you my home
brew here it is I don't know if you can
see it very well let me see if I can get
a
it's it's not going to be clear it's not
going to
be you know it ain't going to look like
table wine or nothing but uh This was
done with watermelons a couple of grapes
not very many mainly just a lot of
watermelon grape sugar
yeast water time that's
it and I wish I could tell you guys the
final gravity of it to but uh I was
getting ready to do the final gravity
test before I bottled it today and uh I
dropped my hydrometer in the sink
sanitizing it and it
broke oops so I'm kind of screwed when
it comes to that uh which really sucks I
got a couple more batches up there going
and I got to wait you know a few days to
get one on Amazon or something cuz
there's no Home Brew shops where I
live
so let's give it a
taste well it's definitely a little more
potent than I thought it'd be it was
shooting for
a
I was shooting for about uh between 10
and 12% alcohol by volume but uh I'm
thinking that's closer to
15 maybe
higher uh I did put quite a bit of sugar
in this batch
um and I let it sit for exactly a
week like I said I wish I could have got
the final uh final specific gravity on
it for you but oops my bad next
badge it's sweet
it's it's weird you can't really taste
watermelon anymore I mean you kind of
way back
but it's real sweet
real not very it's not too dry you know
normally when you home brew
wine it gets kind of dry some times
and this stuff ain't bad it's easy to
drink tastes pretty
good
uh I'll be honest with you I had a glass
of this earlier when I bottled
it and another one when I was eating
dinner and
now this is my third today and
I it's doing a job
but I guess the
uh the full review will be tomorrow
morning on I'll let you know how I feel
after I
uh drink a [ __ ] I got a gallon of it
sitting in there so I don't know if I'm
going to be able to drink that whole
thing tonight or
not I'll let you know
tomorrow not too bad and this is
my that's my first time ever doing any
kind of Home Brew at
all
turned out pretty good I'm glad because
I got three more batches going up there
and if this one sucked then
I I don't know what the other badges
would tastes like but we got uh we got
two gallons that I made the same way but
with strawberry instead of watermelon
and
then the other day I picked up a
shitload of citrus so I made a batch
that's got a it's got two
oranges uh four lemons and two or three
limes in it I think it's pretty much a
citrus blend
uh I did I bought I jugged that one up
the other night or got it in the
fermentor the other night and it's I
mean it's bubbling not very fast though
um I didn't want to I only had about
a a little over a quarter of a teaspoon
of yeast left and the one pack and I
didn't want to open a whole new pack
just
to so I put that in there usually I put
put half a teaspoon in a
gallon and but it's going I don't know
if it's
because uh the yeast has to take off or
if it's because uh the acidity in the
batch I'm not too sure like I said I'm a
rookie when it comes to this but the
watermelon and the strawberry took off
real
quick so we'll see soon as I get the
strawberry done which should maybe
tomorrow it might be done tomorrow but
like I said I busted my hydrometer so I
can't I can't really tell the only thing
I can do is taste it
and if it still tastes good and it has
some alcohol in it while I'm going to
bottle
it not too
bad if
uh the only thing I can really place it
on is if
uh
it's like tastes kind of like that Boon
Farm stuff or like Bartles and James or
something like that but with quite a bit
more kick it's got a little more alcohol
in it than
those but anyway there's my review on my
very first batch of
Homebrew I think I'm going to go get
another glass thanks
guys hey guys just a little uh side note
here um I was going to try and carbonate
this
um but with my hydrometer being busted I
didn't know you know how much sugar I
should put in or anything along those
lines or
what you know because you normally you
dump sugar in after it's fermented out
all the other sugar and you seal it and
you let it go again and it'll carbonate
and instead of putting an air lock you
put a just a cap on and it'll carbonate
your
stuff but I didn't want to do that
without a hydrometer uh
so I was going to try and force
carbonate it which you take to do that
you take two
uh two plastic bottles you drill a hole
in the caps and you run a hose from one
to the other and one of them you run the
hose all the way to the bottom of the
bottle and the other one you just have
it in the cap then you put your product
in
the in the bottle with the hose all the
way to the bottom and in the other
bottle you put a baking soda and vinegar
you see them both up and then the carbon
dioxide goes to the one with your
product in it and you shake it about and
it's supposed to carbonate your product
and I I've seen guys do this on YouTube
and stuff and it looked like it worked
pretty good I mean it's one dude
carbonated like lemonade and water and
milk you know and all kinds of stuff and
it worked you know so I figured it' work
for my
brew and uh so I tried it and uh I guess
I had too much pressure and it blew the
hose out and there's you know the hose
is whipping around and there's Bruce
squirting all over my kitchen and and
jerk the hose out of it and it was a
whole fraking
mess so uh I didn't get it carbonated
but it's still
good I went and got me another
glass
anyway I wish I could have
U film that cuz it have probably been
funny you know watching my fat ass run
around and kitchen trying to stop all
this [ __ ] from happening that have
probably been good stuff worth a few
laugh
um anyway thanks guys
