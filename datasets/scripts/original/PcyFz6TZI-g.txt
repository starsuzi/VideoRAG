What's goodie?
It's your boy, Nate.
AKA TabaskoSweet.
This is Cheap Thrills,
you know what the [BLEEP] it is.
Today I'm gonna show you how to bless
yourself with another one of my favorite
drops from spring 17.
This week we're looking at
the much anticipated vape
special edition capsule release
of the OG Shark Hoodie.
Damn, is it Shark Week already?
We've all seen this iconic shark-hoodie
design making cameos on some
of my favorite real ones, C-Breezy,
A$AP Rocky, and the realest one out there,
my boy Future.
So, what makes this design so legendary?
Damn, where do I start?
First of all the shark design
on the hood is lit as [BLEEP].
Someone sees you wearing this
hoodie from across the room,
they're gonna be like damn,
whose mans is that?
Then there's the classic Bape extra
long zipper that goes all the way up,
covers your face,
it doesn't get anymore rarer than that.
Lastly they're really bringing in the heat
with their color waves this season.
With my personal favorite being
this very hard peach one.
A must cop for
all those sensitive players out there.
I see you.
I've seen these up on eBay already for
$700.
Trash, I'm confident that we can make
this hoodie without having to shell out
serious coin.
So here's what you're gonna need.
First, you're gonna need
a peach hoodie in your size.
If you can't find a peach one,
grab a white one and throw a couple
of red socks in there in the wash.
Felt in red, yellow, white, and
black, a super long zipper,
a pair of scissors, cuz I stay cutty,
a hot glue gun and some extra clips.
All right, let's get it popping.
So we're gonna start out by sketching
out all the shapes that are gonna
be in our shark design.
Starting on my red felt,
we're gonna draw the pupil to the eyes.
And you might need some reference for
this, but
personally I'm gonna take
it straight from the dome.
Don't worry about the marker you're not
gonna see any of the markings because this
is the reverse side of the fabric.
Once you glue this on,
it's all gonna be Gucci from there.
Now that we've got our designs
all sketched out on the felt,
you need to cut it.
Bape's price is way too high,
they need to cut it, whoo,
cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it.
You're looking at what's gonna
be a shark's eye, my man.
Handle these edges with care, my dude.
Wooh, all right after hours of cutting
we finally got all our letters together.
We got our shark teeth,
shark eyes, shark pupils.
Everything we need for
our legendary hoodie.
And I don't know about you but
I don't have time to be sewing today.
So you know I showed up with my heater.
[SOUND] I found it's easiest
to start with the eyes.
Now to get the placement right you wanna
go four fingers down from the top and
two across, and glue away my guy.
Be careful not to use too much,
you only need a little bit.
>> [SOUND]
>> Now the pupil placement is pretty
high up,
kinda like the sharks going like this.
Very clean.
I'd say we're about one-eighth
of the way to a $700 hoodie.
Now we're gonna put the mouth down.
Usually what you want
to do is stack them so
that you can put everything
down in one single unit.
You want the tongue on the bottom
one there, then the teeth and
then the shark lips.
So lets get this cracking, you know the
placement is right if the bottom corner
of the mouth is touching the hoodie seam.
Let her rip.
Make sure you don't get caught with hot
glue strings that's a dead give away.
Wow, looking fresh.
Always make sure you have your markings
hugging the edge of the hoodie and
none of them hanging off.
So as you can see we've got all our
hood markings locked in, in the back.
And the front, also looking pretty fresh.
Now we're ready to install that super
long zipper that goes over the face.
But first we gotta split
this thing down the middle.
You wanna start by spreading it out so
that it's easier to work with.
Then I'm gonna take my scissors and
start at the existing hood seam
to cut right down the middle.
You wanna go slow and steady,
cuz you only get one shot at this.
Just doing a little surgery here.
And we're one step closer to
the hoodie you've been dreaming of.
Sweet, looks good, and
now weÂ´re ready for our zipper install.
But these things come way
longer than you need.
Let's measure from the bottom
of the hoodie to the top,
then I'm gonna cut off
the extra here at the top.
Now, it's time to start
gluing down your zipper.
Now remember to put your glue
on the sides of the zipper and
not on the actual hoodie.
That way it'll look cleaner,
and like you actually sewed it.
Probably notice that the hot glue dries
pretty fast, so you gotta act quickly.
Now just lock in the other side and
we can move on to the hood.
Now we're onto the most critical
part of this piece, the hood.
Make sure the shark's mouth is even and
then we can get to gluing.
And there you have it, the iconic Bape
Shark Hoodie in hard as [BLEEP] peach.
We got our shark marking on the front,
some very clean lettering on the back, and
a fully functional zipper
that goes all the way up.
Now, I know I had a lot of
you fooled with this car but
you ready to see my real whip?
[SOUND].
All right, here we are.
This is my whip right here,
cost me a cool 200 bucks.
All right, so
you know I always club my baby girl,
can't have her getting stolen parking
around on skid row all the time.
Don't mind this stuff.
Got my octane boost.
Gotta pass my smog test.
Got my tools, broken heart,
I can fix that baby girl.
I bet you wanna see what's under the hood.
All right, I know it looks like
a Nissan but it runs like a rari baby.
Hell yeah, it's lit.
Staying hydrated I always
got water on deck.
I got this poncho in here,
I know it seems a little inhumane, but
I'll take you to the splash zone, baby.
If you ride with me I'll
let you take shotgun, baby.
Shot-out to all my Cheap Thrills fam.
Thanks for all the comments, DMs and
bringing heat to all my tracks.
Let's listen to little bit from
my favorite one, shall we?
[MUSIC]
Ooh.
[MUSIC]
You go hard, bro.
[MUSIC]
Yo I'm glad I could help you get
this [BLEEP] off your chest.
Until next time,
keep hitting me with those requests.
And ladies keep sliding into my DMs.
