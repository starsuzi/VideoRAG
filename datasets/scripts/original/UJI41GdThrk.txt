hi I'm Eric Watson at Watson's hat shop
located in historical Cave Creek Arizona
here at Watson's hat shop we make fine
tailor custom hats to any style today
I'm going to show you how to shape a
cowboy hat so we have a steam going here
we want to lightly Spritz the hat with
some water and doing so we want to warm
the felt
up and this is just a simple
shaping rotate the hat like
this get it nice and
warm and by doing this we're open the
pores up in the
felt so we take the hat and we're going
to use this tool here to set the center
crease
now we got our Center crease
there want to set the crease with some
steam and we're going to put some side
creases in the side of the Hat
so we're just reapplying the uh there
used to be a crease like this in the Hat
so we're just reapplying the crease into
the hat like it used to
be
so we're setting that crease real good
here with the
steam real nice and this steam's very
hot so you want to be careful
and you don't want to overstress the
felt which can damage
it and there you have it that is how you
put a shape into a cowboy hat and I'm
Eric Watson from Watson's hat shop thank
you
