how to remove studs from your dishwasher
so you can see the bottom of the
dishwasher furthest flood it gets us if
you just recently clean your dishwasher
or you use the wrong soap accidentally
I'm going to show you a cheap way cheap
quick way to get rid of these suds okay
you going to need a little bit of
vegetable oil okay you just need a half
of cat four so you just pour that inside
your dishwasher then you close it and
you let it run for a second okay I'll
let this just watch a run for about two
to three minutes as you can see all the
slugs are gone okay and I'll just let
your dishwasher finish the cycle with no
dishes in it and you'll be good to go
