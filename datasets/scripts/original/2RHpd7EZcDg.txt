hi guys this is rustic David welcome
back to my workshop today I'm going to
show you a little bit uh maybe a
controversial video on sharpening a lot
of people ask me about sharpening now
there's endless videos out there on the
net about how to sharpen your tools
really well and they're all I think most
of those videos are really
fantastic uh but I do have people asking
me yeah but I don't have this and I
don't have that I've got this and they
they show me something like this some
old oil stone that they dug out of a
shed
somewhere uh
so I'm going to show you the best
results we can get with some old oil
stone that you might have lying around
in your shed if you already an
accomplished woodworker please don't
bother watching this video but if you're
just beginning and that's the only thing
you've got and you want to get some kind
of a edge on your rusty old chisel uh
stick around maybe we'll uh learn
something okay so let's get started we
should do is get these
things a bit cleaned
[Music]
up this one seems like some kind of fine
Stone looks quite nice this is a
fine
it's definitely an oil
Stone this one I don't know can you see
the shape of this you're not going to
get anything very flat out of this but
you know let's give it a clean and see
uh what we can do with this let get all
this baked sore dust off
it and this one looks like a
two-sided
cheapy
from the hardware
store might be able to do
something yeah it's got two sides on it
you see that it's like coarse and a
fine Co and
fine so if youve got an old stone have a
look if it's got two sides or if it's
just this is also two sides this is also
coarse and fine I don't know what
somebody was sharpening with
this it's got a very strange shape about
it but they were sharpening something
like this a
lot okay so let's get all this out the
way
zuda okay so now the next thing I'm
going to do I'm going to give them a bit
of a clean uh in here I've got some old
I think it's
diesel yeah this is a bit of old diesel
so I'm just going to get some diesel on
a rag here you can use
kerosene I don't use petrol don't use
Benzene it's bloody dangerous shouldn't
keep it hanging around your shop buckets
of petrol but get some kind
of kerosene is great I just happen to
have diesel so I'm using diesel this is
the our
patient um I've been using this for
cleaning glue stuff for years it's very
chipped and broken on the end
here uh it's got a brass furl feral FAL
whatever I'm not sure what's what what
this is I don't know it doesn't seem to
any stamp on it or anything so let's
give it a clean up and uh and see what
we can get it to do
assuming we're total beginners and we
don't have a lot of equipment you
perhaps not got or grind stone or
anything like that so I'm just going to
start off with a bit of sandpaper and
clean off all the
glue dirt
rust keeping the back of the Chisel
flat this I started off with a rough
[Music]
paper
now the important area is here this is
where your Cutting Edge is going to be
so what happens up here it's less
interesting down here this is important
to get this
area okay now it's got this big chip out
of the corner here now to be
realistic sanding this off now or
grinding this off with with stones is
it's just too much and if you don't have
a grind stone and you got a belt sander
if not find someone with a a grindstone
and just get them to clean that up for
you you should have about a 30Â° angle
here okay I'm not going to go into the
geometry but you can also work with this
deal with this it's not the end of the
world eventually it will disappear the
more and more you sharpen it but for
this video I'm not going to start
getting rid of that now I could go over
to my belt sander and get rid of it I
have saw s people was sliding around now
again there's plenty of videos about
building all sorts of jigs to hold your
stones and whatnot for the purpose of
this video I just want to move forward I
want to show you
guys even if you don't have all the
fancy equipment which is what people
seem to complain about my students so
yeah I saw this video he got this and he
got that and I don't have any of that so
now I've just held the Sandpaper with a
couple of nails now I can put these
other pieces on the top and they won't
sland around sandpaper and
and just keeping the angle like I put my
finger I got the
bevel now I'm going to hold it as close
as I can to the end of the blade and I'm
going to rock my body backwards and
forwards like
this trying to keep things straight as I
can
e
how should we do that we can go back to
this bit of old sandpaper here
and
can you see that it's hollowed out in
the middle this Stone so that's going to
take some work to flatten
that and
it already blocked up my
sandpaper okay
so I worked on this some more with the
Sandpaper and then this Old Stone which
I said was
very bent and eaten away in places I
used the hard side on the soft side and
I straightened this up with this Stone
and then I used the hard side of this to
straighten up the soft side and I used
that and so on and so forth and the
result is that I got a really nice
flat
stone so now I'm using the hard side and
trying to straighten this one but this
one's much harder than this but I'm
going to give it a
go I'm just cleaning off all that stone
dust whatever Mason's called stone
[Music]
dust
can you see I've got a dip in the middle
of this Stone still now I can avoid it
I've got a flat area here but I'll see
if I can get it out a little bit
[Applause]
[Music]
more
that
[Music]
clean okay so from the rough Stone let's
see uh what it
does
this block of
pine
ooh
W that's from the 200 stone or whatever
it is I don't know I guess from the
rough Stone we got quite a nice little
Edge there okay so let's go up to this
let's call it the medium
Stone
hard to feel what's going on with all
this oil and
grit oh yeah I've got a Bev a
bur
now that's
it it's starting to get a bit sharp on
these corners
so going to break those it doesn't cut
me while I'm using
it
okay still got a bit of a bird on the
back got rolled
over
okay so let's see what happened
now it cuts
wood it's not too
[Music]
bad so we've done
the rough side and the medium side so
now we can move over to this
finer
Stone and continue on with the same
process
feels a bit more comfortable but still
some grit or something it
is
[Applause]
I think we're going to call it a
day out of what you have got so I
invested some time and effort I
flattened these old Stones I cleaned
them up I worked my way up from the
rough to the medium to the fine and this
is our end result let's have a little
test on a piece of
wood so we'll try the corner
[Music]
again oh that feels
much
better than the last
one that's nice now let's have a look
what would happen if we started trying
to
chop into the grain
here
you see it's sinking in to the
table
well it's
cutting quite
nicely you see
that cut wood here is quite
clean I could actually cut a mortise
like
that what other cut might I want to do
with this might want to do a pairing cut
but I don't believe it's going to do it
very well let's have a
go see what we can do let's uh
let's do a
cut right is this
chisel
could be much sharper but could be much
worse it's actually getting the work
done and before I do that let's see what
would
happen
you've got a blunt chisel you're trying
to cut a house if like this
let's shorten the
gray and see how it does
now
oh would you look at
that so you can see what a difference
that makes just shortening the grain all
of a sudden life got much
easier
it doesn't really like coming in this
direction it's cutting better from the
other
side
but that would make a
passable housing
joint Dayo
rabbit pry
flat so there you go okay
so thanks for watching this video
through to the end um if you've got some
old Stones like this and didn't think
you could sharpen some old chisels that
came into your hands I don't know
someone in the family gave them to you
whatever so go and dig them out clean
them up and try and get a edge on one of
your chisels and do a little bit more
advanced would work now it's time we can
move on from screws and nails and start
cutting some joinery so I wish you all
the very best with your Stones thanks
for watching and um I'll see you in the
next video all the best oh don't forget
like subscribe and ring that little bell
and uh that does a lot of good for me
thanks a lot and do leave comments below
I really really like it I try to get
back to all of you as soon as I can all
the rest
