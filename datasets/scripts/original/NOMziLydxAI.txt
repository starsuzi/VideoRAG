- You guys, these
blackened fish tacos today?
Mm, mm, mm!
Perfectly cooked tacos with
a little Southern flavor
You don't have to come all
the way down to New Orleans
to have blackened fish tacos with me.
I'm bringing the recipe to you
in this week's episode of
the Taco Tuesday Series.
Not only are these tilapia
filets perfectly seasoned,
but they also have a delicious
cilantro lime drizzle.
So let's start by making
our cilantro lime dressing
right into our blender.
We're just going to
combine some sour cream,
milk, lime juice, garlic powder,
a pinch of salt, and black pepper.
And of course, some chopped cilantro.
Let's give this a go.
(blender whirring)
And that's it.
I'm gonna transfer this
right into a squeeze bottle
because, that way, everyone
can drizzle their dressing
right over their tacos.
I saved some time by purchasing
bagged slaw at the store,
but you can, of course,
shred that cabbage by hand.
Now onto the main part
of this meal, the fish.
You can pan-fry the fish, but
because tilapia is so fragile,
I'd rather stick it in a
sheet pan and call it a day.
So I'm first gonna stick
the pan in my preheated oven
to heat it up.
So next, my fish is on a cutting
board, and I'm going to season
each filet with some
Cajun blackened seasoning.
Now our pan should be hot, so
lets remove it from the oven.
Let's give the fish a generous
coat with cooking spray,
or olive oil.
Place that side down, and now
sprinkle some more seasoning,
and a little more spray.
And we're going to stick these in the oven,
but baking time is going to vary,
depending on the thickness of your fish.
These are going to go in for
about 10 to 15 minutes.
Since the fish is almost done,
I'm going to start on my slaw,
which is crazy easy.
Cabbage and lime.

I'm just going to give
each filet a coarse chop
into larger pieces that
I can put in my taco,
right on the pan.
This is the quickest fish taco night ever.
(playful salsa music)
Finally, the best part,
well, before we eat.
We're going to assemble this.
So I'm just going to place some of the slaw
right onto my tortilla.
We're going to top it with
a few pieces of fish.
Next, a generous drizzle of cilantro lime dressing.
No more waiting, guys.
(playful salsa music)
Mm, these are incredible.
