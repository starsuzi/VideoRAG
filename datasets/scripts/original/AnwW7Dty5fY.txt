hi chef Robert from the Willow Room uh
today we're going to do a breakfast item
we haven't really done too many
breakfast items I don't think we've done
any actually but we have a delicious Red
Velvet pancake made from scratch which
would be great for Valentine's Day so
what we're going to do first we're going
to take our dry
ingredients this is
flour
uh this is 1 and 3/4 cups of flour we're
going to sift all our dry
ingredients we have a cup of powed
sugar this ensures there's no lumps or
anything once we start uh our
mix we have cocoa powder which this
would be a third of a
cup you don't have a a uh sifter like
this if you have just maybe a strainer
you can run it through uh that works
also and there you have our sifted
product okay to this we're going to
add 1 and 1/2
tpoon of baking
powder this is going to Aid in our
pancakes
Rising
just going take a wire
whip mix that
up okay there you have our dry
ingredients
next we're going to go with our wet
ingredients and into the bowl we have
two eggs two large
eggs
uh we
have 1 and 1/2 cups of
Buttermilk we're going to
put half a teaspoon of salt thir of a
cup of granulated
sugar right uh 2 tblspoon of melted
butter
and last but not least I'm going to put
2
tspoon of red food
pelv
okay
then bar whip we're going to whip this
up now we're going to start
incorporating our dry ingredients into
the
wet be all right if you have a little
bit of lumps in in this uh you don't
want to over mix it
there you have it that's
about all it takes very easy there's
nothing like a uh fresh made pancake uh
we're going to let this sit for a minute
and we're going to start the cream
cheese and masarone
syrup okay this is very simple also we
have masarone cheese 2 oz 2 oz of cream
cheese put that in there and we're going
to soften this we have that loosened up
next we're going to put uh this is heavy
cream a half a
cup take a spatula and
just clear the sides of this we have
that mixed we're going to put half a cup
of powdered sugar in
there just you can see that's
it has a little bit of thickness to it
but it's still uh loose kind of like a
thick syrup and that'll work well on the
pancakes all right we're ready to cook
our pancakes uh I have a griddle here
you might may have one at home uh if you
don't a pan works just as well I have a
little pan release
here and spraying on this
griddle if you don't have pan release
you can moisten a towel a paper towel
with oil and just rub it on the pan or
The
Griddle I'm going to take approximately
2 oz of our pancake
mix L it on start seeing bubbles forming
in them and
uh once you get a good number of Bubbles
and they start bursting that's a pretty
sure sign it's time to flip the
pancake if you notice uh we have some
bubbles starting to form here and
they're kind of bursting it's
been approximately two minutes so we're
going to flip the pancakes flip the
pancakes cook 2 minutes on the other
side and we're ready to Plate them we're
going to take one
pancake put a little of our masar Plum
cream cheese syrup on
it add the next
one repeat the process with
the
topping garnish it with a couple mint
leaves
raspberries and that's it simple was
that uh great uh breakfast for
Valentine's Day so till see you again uh
