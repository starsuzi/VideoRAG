hi I'm Lindsay Anne and today I'm going
to show you how to create that perfect
Bakery style swirl to give your cupcakes
that extra fancy
[Music]
touch piping that perfect swirl on your
cupcakes is actually really simple and
depending on what type of decorating tip
you use you can create create a ton of
different looks this is a small set of
decorating tips by Wilton um they're
great for small embellishments or
writing letters this is a jumbo set by
Eco I got these on Amazon and they're
actually some of my favorite because
they give standard siiz cupcakes a
really nice full look today we're going
to be using just standard large tips by
Wilton um first I'm going to show you
how to create a basic round tip swirl
using a classic round tip
this is um a Wilton 2A and what you're
going to do is start in the
center and you're just going to move
outward all the way around overlap on
top of itself burst of pressure pull up
and there you have a cute tight little
round
swirl next I'm going to be showing you
an open star tip this is probably one of
the more common
tips and it creates that really nice
Bakery style swirl today I'm going going
to be using the Wilton 1 M and you use
the same
technique where you start in the middle
go to the outside all the way around and
up do a little burst of pressure and
pull up and there you have a really fun
Bakery style
swirl next I'm going to be using the
Wilton 2D this is a closed star tip it's
really similar to the open star tip just
the ends Point inward
and we're going to use the same
technique as before start in the center
go to the outside all the way
around and up and there you have a
really fun ruffly looking pretty
cupcake and next we're going to be using
a French tip this is similar to the open
star tip it's just a little tighter
look and today I'm going to be using the
Welton 4B
and again start in the middle go to the
outside all the way around and up and
pull up and that gives a really clean
nice look I love this one lastly we're
going to be using more of an
oldfashioned technique and that is using
an offset spatula um these come in large
or small sizes I like using the small
size for cupcakes and you're just going
to get a
little blob of icing
and plop it right on
top and just kind of smooth it out over
the top of the
cupcake and once you have it all the way
covering the
surface clean that
off and you're going to press your
spatula in and while you turn the
cupcake One Direction you're going to
turn the spatula the other direction and
you're going to go all the way around
once you reach the other side you go
back the other direction and pull up and
that gives it's a little less clean but
it's more fun kind of a retro looking
cupcake and there you have your perfect
Bakery style swirl five completely
