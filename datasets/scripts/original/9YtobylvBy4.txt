once you've got the yoyo string properly
adjusted for your height you are going
to want to find a fast way to wind the
yoyo up
now i know that we can all do this and
occasionally you know if you find the
string slipping what you can do
is wrap the string over one of your
fingers and then wrap under it a couple
of times
then when you pull it out that'll make
sure that it doesn't slip at the bottom
but you know what that really takes a
long time and it can feel really tedious
every time you mess up a trick you've
got to wind it all the way up like that
so there are better ways
one way that's a little bit faster is to
take the yoyo and to hold it
in your yoyo hand and then take your
finger on your opposite hand and just
split the string just like this
and you want to take the yoyo and place
it right on the string take your
opposite hand and put it right above the
yoyo so that the yoyo is just sitting on
the string like so
and you want to switch the height of
your hands and when you do that you will
notice that the yoyo is spinning and it
actually just wound up half the string
to get the rest of the string wound up
you'll probably still just want to wind
it the normal way
again that's faster than the normal wine
but it's still not as fast as it can be
so what i'm going to show you
is how to wind the yoyo
like this but to really understand this
trick it's best to understand the three
things that make a yoyo wind back up
so the first one which is going to feel
a little bit obvious is that the yoyo
has to be spinning if the yoyo is not
spinning
obviously it's not going to come back
but still we know that a yoyo can spin
down at the bottom of the string
and not come back
and so what's the second thing that
helps it come back the second thing is
that the string has to have slack and so
slack is when there is less distance
between the yoyo and your hand than the
length of the string
and so anytime you give the yoyo slack
that is going to make the yoyo come back
and that is actually why when you pull
the yoyo up or even if you were to drop
your hand quickly
both of those cases give slack to the
string
and they are going to make the yoyo come
back up
there is a third thing that you need to
know and that is that the yoyo also has
to be straight in line with the string
so i'm going to use a trick that we'll
learn later called sleeping beauty to
illustrate this
when you do this trick you can see that
the string is kind of bent around the
yoyo and that's kind of like slack
but it doesn't come back until i pop the
yoyo up and it becomes even with my hand
and as soon as it becomes even it takes
that slack and it comes right back
so that's the three things that you need
spin slack and straight if you can do
that with any trick the yoyo is going to
wind back up
i am going to show you one of the
easiest ways to do that right now
so to start this trick you want to place
the yoyo between your thumb and the
middle finger of your opposite hand you
are just going to pinch it and grab the
yoyo pretty firmly
and next you want to take your yoyo hand
and place it right above your head and
so what you are going to do from here is
you are going to use your thumb
on your opposite hand to push down
and try to get some spin on the yoyo and
at the same time you are going to use
your opposite hand to pull up and
hopefully it will bounce the yoyo up in
the air and give this yoyo a little bit
of slack so that while it's spinning it
can eat that string up and come back to
your hand
now one of the most important things
about this
is that you do keep your opposite hand
right above your head
when i have taught this trick to some
people they get nervous that the yoyo is
going to come back and hit them in the
face
and so they move their hand off to the
side to try it and then the yoyo
it does not wind up because the string
is not straight in line with the groove
of the yoyo so make sure when you
practice it you get your hand out in
front of you just like that you do it
straight up and down
and when you first learn this trick you
may find that you know it's only winding
up a little bit and you can just kind of
do this motion to get the rest of the
string wound up but eventually as you
practice it you're going to get better
and better at it and you're going to be
able to nail it every time which is
going to make learning the rest of your
tricks a whole lot easier and a whole
lot less frustrating because you don't
have to spend all that time winding the
string
