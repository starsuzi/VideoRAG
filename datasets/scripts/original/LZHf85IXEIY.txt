Rev up your engines!
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel
are you worried that your car's brakes
aren't working right, then stay tuned
because I'm going to show you how to
change your car's brake pads today
now this Honda needs a brake job in the
rear, because the squealers are making a
sound, the pads in this Honda has a
little metal Squealer so when the pads
get really thin, the squealers touch
the rotors and make a sound, so it's time
to jack up the car pull out that wheel
here's the brake caliper,
there's a bolt on the top and a bolt on
the bottom, you just remove the two bolts,
hit them hard to loosen them, then finish
taking the bolts off and pull the
caliper off, there's a worn-out pads here
now you can see in these pads, there's
hardly any pad material left, it should
be about this thick and there's only
about Oh less than a quarter of a dimes
worth left, now of course you have to
decide what kind of brake pads to use
well here's my suggestion, you'll find
there's all kinds of brake pads out
there that will fit your car, but most
cars come with ceramic pads these days
so if use a cheaper non ceramic pad as
replacement, they might stop okay but
they'll probably make a lot of noise, so
I personally use Akebono ceramic pads
when I do a brake job, they might spell
their name funny but they make great
pads, now with this Honda the hardest part
is getting the piston to go back in
you'll notice it has a hash mark that's
for a special tool to go into and that's
because on this Honda the rear discs are
also the emergency brake, you need a
special tool like this that fits into
the groove so you can turn it and
squeeze it in at the same time, on this
type of setup do not use a giant pair of
pliers to squeeze it in, I've seen guys
do that and you'll ruin the caliper and
it'll cost you hundreds of dollars for a
new caliper, as you can see the tool is
easy to use, you just slide it into the
caliper and then tighten it up as you
turn the handle, it turns the caliper and
pushes it in at the same time, now you
can't really do this job without the
tool, but don't fret I bought a whole set
of these tools from harbor freight tools
and it costs $40 when it was on sale, now
all you have to do is pull out the old pads
and put the new ones in, then slide the
caliper back on and put the bolts on, now
you want to make sure they're good and
tight, so finally put the wrench on and tap it a few times with the hammer to make
sure both of them are real tight, now
brake pads work in pairs, so we just did
the left rear side and now we've got to
do the right rear side, but it's exactly
the same as the left rear only it's on
the other side, that's all for now because I've got
a flight to catch, but if you got a
question you just go to Scotty kilmer.com
and I'll answer it as soon as I get
back from this flight!
