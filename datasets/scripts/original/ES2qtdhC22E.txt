First up,
preheat your oven
to 100 degrees Celsius,
then line three baking trays
with baking paper.
Draw a 20cm circle
on each tray.
Next, add the eggwhites
to a clean and dry bowl
and set the mixer
to medium.
Gradually add
the caster sugar in
at one tablespoon
at a time.
Mix in between
so it's all dissolved.
Then add the cornflour
and the vinegar
and mix until
just combined.
Divide into
three even portions
on your prepared trays,
using the 20cm circle
as a guide.
Pay attention to this part,
as it will really
make a difference
to the end result.
Bake in the oven
for an hour and a half
and swap the trays
between the shelves
so they're even.
Cool the meringues in the
oven with the door ajar
for an hour or until
they're completely cool.
To make the
raspberry sauce,
combine the raspberries
and the icing sugar
in a medium saucepan
over a medium heat.
Bring to a simmer.
Strain through
a metal sieve into a bowl
and chill in the fridge.
Mix the cream
and icing sugar
until soft peaks form.
Then the jam
is folded through
with a spoon
for a marble effect,
but be sure
not to over-whip it.
To assemble,
place one meringue disc
on a serving plate
and spoon over one-third
of the cream mixture,
then continue layering
with the remaining meringue
disc and cream mixture.
Top with mixed berries
and cherries when
they're in season.
Drizzle with
raspberry sauce,
dust with extra
icing sugar
and serve immediately.
