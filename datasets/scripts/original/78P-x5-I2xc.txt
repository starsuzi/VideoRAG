this recipe you're going to need some
shrimp medium or large size you're going
to need about a
pound then you're going to need some
minced
garlic you're going to need three
cloves some parsley t one
tablespoon and then you're going to need
some chopped
tomatoes however many you like
they recommend about a
cup and then you're going to need
chicken broth 1/4 cup you need some pan
noodles allpurpose
flour um pepper and salt to taste you're
going to need 3 tbspoon of
butter you're going to need some you're
need 34 cup of milk whatever kind of
milk you want you're going to need some
mozzarella cheese
and then you're going need some Parmesan
cheese preheat the oven to 350Â°
F and then in the pot you're going to
boil water and then cook the Panet
according to the directions on the
package and then you're going to drain
the pan and we've already done that so
the next step is
to uh melt one tbspoon of butter over
medium heat in a large Skillet so we're
going to start doing that
[Music]
[Music]
next step is just to remove the shrimp
but you want to make sure you leave the
juice in
there
[Music]
add the remaining 2 tablespoons of
butter
[Music]
add the flow and then kind of make it
golden whisk until golden it
says
it's already kind
of how it's supposed to
be so then it
says to add the chicken broth and
milk and let that come to a
simmer
[Music]
I just kind of stir this until you think
it kind of all kind of Blends you don't
really want the flour
and garlic and butter to be chunky
so stir in the monster
moella in the
parmesan kind of make like a
creamy dressing for the
[Music]
p
[Music]
point we're going to
add the
shrimp back into the
pan and also the
[Music]
tomatoes
[Music]
it's uh doesn't really take too long and
really simple and it's it's not too
expensive expensive except for the
[Music]
shrimp it says to
garnish with
extra
um parmesan and mozzarella cheese and to
put it in the oven for a few minutes but
um this isn't an oven proof Skillet so
we're going to have to transfer it into
an ovenproof
dish so once you feel like it's stirred
enough you can do it how you want or you
could skip this part but uh
you know it kind of adds a little bit of
extra flavor to the
meal
so I
[Music]
put
