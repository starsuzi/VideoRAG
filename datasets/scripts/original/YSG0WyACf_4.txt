how how you doing guys um
so
um today i know some of you might like
going sonic and get a vanilla dr pepper
so i just wanted to share with you how
to make it
so all you need is a dr pepper
and a korean
cranny vanilla flavoring material
and then you just need a
cup or a glass
doesn't really matter
okay so
you
going to pop
okay now i'll just let the fizz go down
and then rather you need a spoon
or
a straw
basically anything you can stir with
will help
so
you can get a saucepan
and then you
get open the
vanilla
like
a
flavoring sauce
and
then you put
a little drop in it like
that
and then you can
close the lid
sorry i have the hiccup so
then you just
mix it up
and then
there you go you have a vanilla dr
pepper
thank you for watching
and see you next time
