I love cooking Johnsonville Italian
sausage links on the grill but when it's
too chilly Outdoors bring it inside
here's how put your Johnsonville Italian
sausage links in a pan add some water
about a/4 of a
cup and just let them steam cook put a
lid on it then after about 10 minutes
take the lid off this is where the real
magic begins this is where we start to
get that sear that we love so much that
car caramelized texture we associate
with fantastic Italian sausage just keep
turning those for about 10 minutes till
they're brown evenly on all sides and
you are set there are more great cooking
tips as well as some fantastic recipes
