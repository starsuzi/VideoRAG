they will suffer I am Charlie and today
I'm gonna be showing you how to make my
delicious New Orleans beignets
a bit mate is a French term for pastry
they can either be made with a choux
pastry or a yeast dough vin is already
needed in France but they are mostly
common in popular in the New Orleans
area
that is this restaurant called cafe de
Mon devanne specializing in
inconvenience over 150 years this recipe
calls for about 15 beignets which can
serve up to about 5 people and even
though it's not like a cafe du monde
style vinny of course nobody can rapid
replicate the capital own mini recipe
but it is absolutely delicious so let's
get started here's all what you will
need to make your New Orleans beignets
you will need some all-purpose flour
sugar instant yeast unsalted butter eggs
at room temperature whole milk at room
temperature and some confectioner sugar
to fry your beignets you will need some
canola oil you can also use cotton C at
all if you like and there we have it add
to 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour 1/3 cup
of sugar 1 tablespoon of instant yeast
and 1/4 teaspoon of salt
stir all ingredients together
in a separate bowl add 3/4 cup of warm
whole milk 1 egg at room temperature in
4 tablespoons of melted unsalted butter
we're going to whisk all the ingredients
together
in our stand mixer with the dough hook
attachment add the wet ingredients into
the dry ingredients you're going to mix
this according to your stand mixer
settings for mixing dough you're gonna
mix this for about four minutes
at 1/8 cup of all-purpose flour
mix for two minutes or until mixture
comes together
now as you can see the dough doesn't
really stick to my hands that lets me
know that our dough is ready lightly
floured the surface of your table add
your dough on top of the table
knead the dough about 20 times
shape the dough into a small rectangle
roll the dough into an 11 inch long by 8
inch wide rectangle
now remember this is an 11 inch long by
8 inch wide rectangle using the knife
cut the dough into squares
once done you should have about 15
squares let the dough rest for about 10
minutes preheat your fire to medium-high
heat in our cast iron skillet add three
cups of canola oil
let the all get hot for about eight to
ten minutes now you're gonna take your
dough and add it into the pan after a
few seconds as you can see the dough
rises to the surface base the dough with
the all for about ten to fifteen seconds
then after ten to fifteen seconds you're
gonna flip your beignet over and you're
gonna base the other side of the dough
with the oil for about ten to fifteen
seconds then once your beanie is done
you're going to remove your beanie from
out the pan and place it onto your
serving dish lined with napkins and as a
final garnish
you're gonna lightly sprinkle some
confectioner sugar right on top you can
add as much as you like
here's the final presentation and there
you have it
beignets made from scratch ah nice time
to go ahead and take a bath oh man look
at that okay
[Music]
the beignet is a nice and soft and yet
that powdered long top very very
good
I admit they even though this is this is
not Cafe Du Monde style venues but
they're absolutely delicious and if you
make them you'll be satisfied just as
much as I am so we did the recipe a try
