Okey, so I'm only going to cover how to remove decals on a windshield ...
... The same method is applied when your removing decals or stickers from your body ...
... or your paintwork.
But it involves some more steps ...
and generally you have to be more
careful since ..
the paintwork can be scratched ...
more easily
then compared to the glass here
but I'll do a video of that as well
and you can see here
when I'm done with it
so please be patient
if you get the wrong video
you'll get the right one soon .. thanks!
Okey, so start by washing off the ...
... windshield.
around and on the decal.
With just .. regular .. ehh, carshampoo and water.
Let's do some cleaning
Remember, on the decal ...
... and around the decal.
and when you're done just take some regular water ...
and ehh ..
wash it off, wash off the carshampoo.
And when your done just ..
leave it to dry for some minutes or ..
clean it all of with some clean-up wipes.
Okey, so now that the area around the ..
decal is completely ..
completely dry and ...
... the decal is also completely dry ..
We shall start to heat up the decal!
With one of these ...
... A simple heating gun
And there's no need to have alot of heat so if you have 3 stages just put it on stage 1.
And a hairdryer is also good for this so ...
hairdryer or a heating gun ...
doesn't mather,
Use one of them.
ehh Okey!
So when we heat up the decal, the adhesive on the backside on the decal ..
Will start to loosen up
and then hopefully we can just grab the decal on the end here ..
and rip it off.
We can also ...
... Hopefully that is:
Scratch it off if we cant rip it off, so lets try it!
It takes some to warm it up. *Blowing noise*
And there we go.
The decal is completely (almost) removed.
Okay so depending on ...
what sticker you're trying to remove and
how long it's been there ..
... the sticker or decal will always leave behind some residue so lets ..
.. remove that as well.
Okey so ..
use some insect and tar removal to really clean off the ..
residues from the adhesive
just spray it on
where the decal was sitting
and around it
and let it dry in for about thirteen seconds
eh thirty seconds.
Now we can use this, this is a tar and insects sponge
it's the awesome since it doesn't scratch ..
our windshield.
So just ..
rub the tar and insect removal in ..
.. on and around
where the decal was sitting
and we'll then remove any ..
.. remaining ..
.. adhesive ..
.. from the windshield.
And let's wash away the insect and tar removal
from the windshield
with some regular water
Okey, now your all done!
And you just to wait for the
... windshield to dry off
or you can use uh...
some clean-up wipes and wipe it off as well.
Just be sure to use an excessive
amounts of water when you clean off or
when you wash off the ..
insect and tar removal.
The insect and tar removal can damage your paintjob ..
.. if you let it dry off on your paintjob so ..
.. use an excessive amount of water!
Yeah .. So I guess that's it.
Thanks for watching and ...
