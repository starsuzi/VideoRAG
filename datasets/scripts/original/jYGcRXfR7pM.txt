hello I'm Rose Barry Nichols Vicki from
the Coast Guard nursery in Albany OR
today we're going to talk about growing
drying using a regular it's been said
that oregano is a spice of life
charge spicy fragrance that is
immediately recognized this is our
Sicilian meaning has a heady sweet
pungent aroma but it's not the opening
right but if you're thinking of cooking
tomato and oregano make it attack lemon
and oregano make it Greek oregano dries
beautifully and unlike many herbs the
aromatics and flavors don't say but
become more concentrated so this is time
to harvest mr. Vega dough has just
recently gone into bloom cut all of
these off and show you
what I do I am Drive and waited here for
Justin already
oops almost lost that one
so what I do with these when I Drive is
I just left the magic paper bag
cut this off there's new growth that's
we're getting down below here let's get
some sleep you guys handful and you can
see the principles of
so I take this here's a handful
I kept the stems off so it isn't too
long these are all going to have to be
stuffed into a paper bag and I take a
rubber band I always use a rubber band
when I'm putting together a bundle first
because these stems are going to fly out
they're using string
that's going to stamps will shrink and
your time ball
rubberband and you find that there's two
loops
it was going to go right after this bag
you see I've labeled still either
breaking anything that falls off is
going to be it'll all fall in the bottom
and three or four big holes like I'm
doing this
dan and little painless and let it let
it dry and check back in a couple of
weeks
Oh
it's just like late
it's too easy to forget so what do I do
with this
this is Sicilian oregano this is my
favorite cookie recipe it's actually a
cross between Martin and Laura Totten
and it it just has this great flavor it
doesn't produce seeds is one of those
unusual sterile crosses and very much
two hours without power
in some parts of the country
look at this we've got some new shoots
coming up down below
other thing that you can do this is all
member of the Maryland outcomes the
characteristic square steps is right now
here it is mid-august you stick this
down close to your soil line just like
this and you take it and you put some
old media old hairpin some kind of
something to hold it in the ground and
five dolly Israel sent out
and you'll have the first thing you do
is you cut it back
so that's one way and you can take
cuttings you can do that and you can
divide you can take from this container
and just cut in half and that's a good
idea
going
you don't want
I'm going to go back and cut all these
stems off today and drag all the top
steps and they'll be due for opening
