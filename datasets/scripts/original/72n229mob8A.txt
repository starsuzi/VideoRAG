okay this afternoon we're going to make
dill tuna fish for sandwiches pretty
simple we've already got our eggs bowled
and peeled we start off with them and
place them in our Bowl sure they're good
and dry
on W than have might be
there I prefer to go with about two eggs
for one can of tuna fish we've already
got the tuna fish drained and put it in
a pan here freeze the sakes now eggs you
can slice them up if you like I like
them for the chunkies I always use a
little whisk
and makes it fun
this bounce around a little bit sort
of mash them up real
good chunky
Style
I say about I use on
average make it your your taste as far
as that goes but uh my preference is is
about two eggs per can of tuna
