- Hey, health nuts,
welcome back to my channel.
Happy New Year.
I'm so excited for 2019.
And to start off the year, I
thought it would be really fun
to share with you guys
my go-to green smoothie,
really how to build the
perfect green smoothie
because this is one of
the number one questions
I get asked on social media,
on my YouTube channel, through emails.
You guys wanna know, what is
this delicious green elixir
I drink every morning
on my Instagram stories?
So there is a lot that goes
into my green smoothies,
but I want to share with you guys
the actual green smoothie
that I drink every day
because I share lots
of different smoothies
here on my channel and on the blog,
but this has been my go-to smoothie
that I've been making for Matt and I
every single morning.
And there is a lot in it,
but it just makes me feel
amazing, balanced, energized,
and it's what I actually
drink every single morning.
So if you guys want
the full code breakdown
on how to build the
perfect green smoothie,
then just keep watching.
Also, I'm gonna have a
printable that you can download.
A link will be in the info
box for you guys to check out
with some easy substitutions
for the ingredients
that I'm sharing in today's video.
So cheers, and let's hop
right into the video.
So in a high-speed blender,
which I will link the exact
blender I'm using down below,
I'm gonna add in a few
handfuls of fresh baby spinach.
You can really use any
greens that you like,
but I find spinach is a good go-to.
Next, I have some cucumber
I just chopped up.
I love cucumber.
It's so hydrating.
And I pretty much add it to
all of my green smoothies.
Next up, for fruit, I have
some frozen banana and mango.
As you can see, I'm only
using half of a frozen banana
and about half a cup of mango.
I like to keep my smoothies low sugar.
And to substitute the extra frozen fruit
that is normally in
smoothies, I'm actually using
steamed and frozen cauliflower.
It's gonna add that texture
that you get from the frozen fruit
without the added sugar.
Next up, I have some fresh ginger.
I like to keep the skin on
when I'm buying organic.
There is lots of nutrients in the skin,
and it's just one less
thing to do in the morning.
To give it a slightly
nutty and creamy taste,
I'm gonna add in some almond butter.
This is optional, but it does
help sweeten up your smoothie.
I like to add in a vanilla
plant-based protein powder.
I will link some of my
favorites in the blog post.
A link will be down below.
You just wanna make sure
you're looking for one
that isn't sweetened with sugars.
Something like stevia is a great option.
For my fiber, I'm adding in some flaxseed.
Because this blender is really strong,
I'm not gonna grind it,
but you can pre-grind it if you'd like.
Adding in some cinnamon.
Not only does it taste amazing,
but it's also great for sugar balancing.
And then my secret
ingredient for the vibrant
green color you always
see in my smoothies,
I'm adding in some spirulina powder.
To find the exact brand and type I get,
be sure to check the blog post
because I'm very picky
on my spirulina powder.
For liquid, I'm actually doing a mixture
of unsweetened nut milk.
You can use oat, almond,
really, whichever you'd like.
And then, I like to do the other half
of just filtered water.
I like to do half and half
just to lighten it up a bit.
And because I like my
smoothies extra cold,
even in the wintertime,
I know that's weird,
I like to add a couple
of ice cubes on top.
Pop the lid on and
blend until very smooth.
I usually like to blend
mine for a full minute
to make sure it's extra creamy-smooth.
And now, you're ready to serve.
Pour it in a tall glass,
add your straw in,
and you're ready to sip.
All right, health nuts, there you have it.
That is how you make the
perfect green smoothie,
at least in my opinion.
This is a drink I have
every morning, like I said.
I love it, it makes me feel amazing.
So if you guys want an actual healthy,
sugar-balanced, green drink
that you can have for breakfast
every day, try this one.
I will have the full
recipe linked down below
over on the blog, as well as the printable
that you guys can
download for how to build
the perfect green smoothie that
will have easy substitutions
for some of the ingredients
that I mentioned.
And if you guys want some
more smoothie recipes,
I have so many on the blog.
I'm actually gonna have a full playlist
linked down below as well.
I hope you guys have fun blending
up your own green smoothie
for breakfast this new year.
And let me know down below,
what do you guys like to
put into your smoothies?
Cheers.
