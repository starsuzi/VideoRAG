so I want to try to tackle the subject
of tank size today and just
briefly this is a pretty controversial
topic
so I was kind of dreading doing this
video but I think that it's really
important and it needs to be addressed
so you know there's a lot of different
opinions on Stocking goldfish and how
many you should have in a tank and what
you know how many gallons per fish all
those sort of
things I'm going to just talk about the
most basic guidelines there
are and um you know you can use your own
judgment beyond that so I'll just let
you guys know that I just did a 80%
water change so the water in my Tank's a
little bit cloudy right now just because
of the buffer I use it usually clears up
in like a half hour to an hour so just
if you're wondering why um the tank
looks a little CL and weird that's
why so tank size um the most basic
General easiest um stocking guideline
there is is 10 gallons per fish and I
don't think in liters I think in gallons
unfortunately so I'll put um some
conversions down below the video so that
you guys can look at that in case you do
in case you do liters instead of gallons
um but 10 Gall per fish and I think
that's about um 40
l so that's that's the most General
basic that's usually what I tell people
because it's the
easiest basic guideline there is but if
you follow that guideline just know that
you will probably you will have to
upgrade your tank at some point that is
not a forever lifelong guideline cuz if
you think about a single tail fish like
a comet they can grow up to 12 in long a
10 Gall tank is only about 20 in long
and 10 in wide so putting a 12in fish in
that
really you know isn't good for their
entire adult life you would want to
upgrade at that point but if you're
talking about little you know 1 2 3 in
goldfish 10 gallons per fish is a
pretty you know General good
rule if you want to get into a little
bit more ideal stock
um guidelines for fancies like you know
orandas or telescope iFish
um uh Pearl scales that sort of
thing uh 20 gallons for the first fish
and then 10 gallons for each fish after
that is usually
recommended so if you had two fancy fish
you would want um at least 30 gallons if
you had three you would want 40 gallons
um so that's the general guideline for
the fancy breeds for the single Tales
like comets
um and common
goldfish they require a little bit more
room because they do grow larger than
the fancy
varieties the fancy varieties at um
adult size are usually typically are
around 6 to 8 in some grow
bigger um but that's the general size
uh for the single tailed fish like
comets and Commons they tend to get a
little bit bigger so they can range
between you know 10 and 14 in
long and they're also um stronger
swimmers so they'll need more room for
that so for the single tail varieties
the you know ideal basic stocking
recommendation is 20 gallons per fish so
if you had two single tail fish 40
gallons would be ideal and again that's
just for they're younger um as they grow
older you would probably need to upgrade
the tank
size um you know these two are fancies
and they are in a 40 gallon tank and it
is you know I wouldn't even think of
adding another fish to this
tank so why can't we just keep goldfish
in a
bowl that's the big question
um so the first reason is that they do
when provided room they grow very
big
um if they're not provided adequate tank
size the theory is that they produce a
growth inhibiting hormone that stops
their bodies from growing so that's why
you'll see um goldfish who have lived in
tanks for several years but they're not
12 in long they're still you know 2 or 3
in long and that's because their growth
has become stunted
there I tried to look up some research
on this and it looks like there is some
actual research that shows that this
does
happen but I am not a biology major so
the research you know reading it was a
little bit beyond me so if any of you
guys watching know the logistics of all
this feel free to enlighten me I've
tried to research it a lot online and it
seems like there's a lot of
different a lot of different theories on
it so it seems like it's you know a
slightly controversial topic
but so this is the basic theory is that
they produce a growth inhibiting hormone
stops their bodies from growing um some
people claim that their internal organs
continue to grow and so it leads to
premature death I don't know if this is
absolutely true or not um just from the
evidence that you see of goldfish living
in bowls for years who never grow it
makes sense so
that's all I can say on that um if you
keep your goldfish in a bowl it's going
to get stunted it won't grow like it
should and it won't um you know live to
its full
potential so the second
reason that you want a gold um that you
want a big tank size is that goldfish
produce a lot of waste so we can use
this image as just a basic um you know
way of explaining this so
if this tank here is a 10 gon this is a
bowl and this is a 20-gallon tank you'll
see that um and the little red dots
represent how much waste or ammonia is
created by the fish within you know
we'll say 24 hours so you'll see in the
bowl within 24 hours that water has
become incredibly toxic to the fish that
can be fatal um in the 10 gon
tank a lot of waste has accumulated but
it's not as bad as the bowl and if you
look at the 20-gallon tank that's going
to be the best water quality for your
fish so the amount of water volume that
you have in the tank is going to make a
big difference in how fast your water
goes toxic and how you know fast that
waste accumulates in your
tank so I think that's all I'm going to
talk about today if you guys have
questions or if you want me to um
you know try to explain anything in more
detail let me know um if you have
suggestions please let me know um put it
in the comments and thanks so much for
watching
