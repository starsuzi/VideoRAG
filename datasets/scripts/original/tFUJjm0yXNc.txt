Juan Pablo Montoya has walked out of a
press conference ahead of this Sunday's
Australian Grand Prix the Williams
driver left the conference when two
comedians posing as reporters kept up a
stream of inane questions as your about
the rising number one of Formula one one
one wonders should one only win one
Formula One one year would one want of
one that won in round one one but one of
them would be in round one do the best
in their class right do you see their
stop so I walk off the racing car drive
engine I must not say the Penta you try
- I can't play golf
Laskey input um right
thank you very much and with that one of
Michael Schumacher's chief rivals was
gone leaving sponsors disappointed and
no doubt the comedian's delays remember
we won
