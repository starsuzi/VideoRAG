all right I'm going to show you how to
go over the ceiling paint with some
ceiling paint that kills mold this is a
real small bathroom and um we keep
wiping it down wiping it down it usually
gets rid of everything but now it's time
to paint it it's been a couple of years
since we've painted it up with some
kills so we're going to do it again and
get rid of all this grow seiling this
bathroom has no um vent in it to vent
out the
shower so it's good to have a vent in
the shower but we're in the middle of
reboiling so for now you just cutting
over this to touch it up while running
pipe up and do the ceiling and uh kind
of make this a little bit more
attractive and get rid of this issue so
I'll show you how to paint the ceiling
all right so in an old bathroom like
this if you need to uh paint the walls
too which is what I'm doing we doing the
ceiling in the walls we just kind of do
like a quick fix while we're working on
other things around here um you're going
to change it from this color to a
different color what you want to do is
you want to start the ceiling first so
we got a roller and and I have like a
paintbrush to do the creases with and um
put some paintbrush in the so put some
paint in the tray and I'll get rolling
here and I'll show you what to do first
so I have some leftover sealing paint
and if you have a lid if you have some
paint left over the easiest way to do it
is get a flathead
screwdriver and kind of
open the paint up
let's
see to mix
[Music]
around I guess this has like a little a
tint to it
and I mix it all
around I believe this paint has a primer
built in and it goes on pink so you can
see where you rolled that's what the
tint is
for and but when it dries it dries
white so you want to mix it all around
the pain stick
and this is a pretty small bathroom so
we don't get a whole lot of
paint and I want to
[Applause]
pull right the
tray and then you're going to want to do
going to put the paint can like on a bag
or something so you don't get it all the
way your
floor all right so I have some paint in
the tray and I have my can on the bag so
I'm going to zip on back over to the
bathroom and uh get painting going to do
is going to put want to put a little bit
of paint on a brush and before you roll
the seil note you can go all
around and get the edges now again we're
doing the um walls too so want like get
all the creases
and you work the way around CU you're
going to do the walls last so when we
paint the walls when to use like an edge
rle all around the top and the ceiling's
dry that way you know the ceiling will
be dry you don't want to Pink the walls
first because if you do the ceiling
second and you white paint on the new
walls so you want to have that happen
kind to make
sure you're smoothing out the paint so
there's no runs and that way when you
roll your walls it'll be nice and smooth
too all right so now I've got all the
edges all touched up with white ceiling
paint and I'm going to startop rolling
out the ceiling to meet up with those
white lines that I've got going on and
um it look pretty
good paint on the roller you kind of
just want to make it tacky you don't
want to Gob it on there work it back and
forth cover the entire
roller flip it out have
to you don't want it drippy you don't
want to have to have paint dripping on
your
[Applause]
pools you want to cover the
roller at the same time you don't want
it to Dripping
everywhere all
right so when you're painting you got to
kind of paint and make a crisscross
pattern like that cover the
area you can see how this pink paint
rolls on pretty nice and uh it's white
paint it actually eat the pain and it'll
dry um this is that sealant paint
that'll show you where you've been and
it dry so it'll dry nice sight like
regular seil paint
wood so I just rolled out the ceiling
and you can already see the difference
and how nice and white it not look and
let this dry do one more coat let that
dry and then we can bang out the walls
the trick too if um you're in between
coats and you don't want to dump out the
extra paint you have left in the tray
put a plastic shopping bag over it slide
the whole tray right into a shopping bag
and kind of tie it up at the end that'll
keep the paint from drying all right so
now that our ceiling's dry we're going
to start to paint the walls and it's
nice and white and uh looks pretty mint
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
run around the top the ceiling with um
an edure and we're going to put some
color up there that way when we roll our
walls we can go right up to the ceiling
and not worry about having to tape the
ceiling or the roll of Hit the CE you
kind of just be careful when you're
rolling the paint on and come right up
to it and I'll show you how to go around
like the door jams and all that and um
if you any tile like this help dos
around the tile around the bottom and I
have our edger right here this one
happens to be a sh line edger and
um has like some wheels on it and the
wheels go right up to like the the
ceiling and let's see on the back it
kind of shows you how to put the pad on
and the chat shet and stuff like that
and see if I
can take it out of the
[Music]
box remove it there'll be like a should
be like a pad in with
it so you can kind of destroy the black
CD
too and then
and this what comes in it it comes with
one of these pads and has little hooks
on the back that you kind of hook over
the um
base so here's the base it has a handle
on
it and has some wheels and when you're
painting the wheels go towards the sand
make sure the paint has no wheels on the
wheels have no paint on them when you're
painting So then the directions will
show you
how to properly put the pad on uh
there's a little more distance near the
top so you're going to
do is put the wheels at the top and
right here there's a little more
distance where there isn't like a
lip and that's how you put it on you put
this part near the top like the
instruction
say so all you have to do is take this
lip and it goes right over the
edge it's pretty easy to do you know I
just was able to do it with one hand and
attach it the seculi and these are
really nice to use um they use it comes
out know with a straight line on the
ceiling and um as long as there's no
pain on these wheels it come out really
well for
you all right what I like to do with
these
um edges is when you put paint on it you
can either put some paint on here with
your roller on the little tray or you
can kind of dip it in watch how you
don't get the wheels on the paint though
so kind like dip it in like
that get a little bit of color on it you
kind of come over here and WIP some of
the excess
off and then that way you won't have
anything dripping on you
[Applause]
right now I've got some color on the pad
it's missing some the corner so we'll
dip the corner a little
bit all right the pad's pretty well
covered and there's nothing on the
wheels so we're going to go up to our
ceiling and just cut out go along just
like this
and come down to get the
middle and just kind of go back and
forth pain the line and you can see how
well it works you have a nice clean line
on the ceiling and there's plenty of a
boorder so you roll the walls and go
right up to that line and you not
comeing anywhere near the
ceiling all when you come to a corner
like this you're going to want to grab
your
brush and put some paint on it
and kind of come to the
corner and kind of spread it all nice
and
even come little B I'm just going to be
careful with the brush and I can use my
Edge for this but if you have a steady
hand you kind of just run it right
along and
then if you get the brush in that
crease um on once you have the crease
all filled in you can hit it with your
roller and it'll spread it out all nice
for
you right so now I have the room all
edged out with the
edger and the corns are all done and it
kind of went
around and hit all the hard spots that I
had to get on with the roller so all we
need to do is you going to take your
roller
and you're going start feting just like
this and you're going to go up to
the spot where you went with the
edge and all the way up it's like a
seiling line and sey you can keep away
from the ceiling you have a nice ceiling
line
now and they kind of go back and forth
to play the paint on the right way on
the wall and just work your way around
the room like
this and apply more paint and get the
spats you must is
needed okay and here's the finished
result of our room and the ceiling's all
done and the walls are all
painted so the method that I used you
can see how good the line came out
around the ceiling and um it's a good
way and easy way to do it it's a pretty
quick way
