hi there H we're going do a quick demo
on how to uh sharpen a chisel and uh a
cutting iron for a plane uh the basic
tools that we require are obviously our
cutting edges so I've got a 25 mm bevel
chisel here um an oil Stone this
particular one is a combination Stone H
it's got two surfaces one for honing one
for grinding we're going to focus on the
finer side of it for horning the actual
uh chisel and
um to do this obviously oil Stone oil
cloth chisel um The Cutting Edge itself
is made up of two surfaces the bevel
side and the back so application of some
oil and we're going to clean the back of
the Chisel okay flat on the oil Stone
quite a bit of
pressure we can immediately see that
it's starting to wear away the back of
that we're getting a nice polished Edge
on that and we can see the remnant of
the metal fings on the oil
Stone once we're happy with the back of
the Chisel we're going to Bevel slide
down raise it up till we get an angle of
30° to hone it and then either motion up
and down the stoil or in a figure of
eight choice is
[Music]
yours maintaining that 30° all the way
through
[Music]
it
move your body not the Chisel keep the
angle
maintained until we get that wire Edge
bur on the back of the Chisel there's
not just enough
[Music]
yet excellent I've just got what we call
a wire Edge you can feel it just on the
back of the Chisel I'm now going to take
that off again plenty of pressure chisel
flat on the stone
clean off
that and we probably have still the
remnants of some metal filings on the
very edge so I'm just going to on a
piece of
softwood take that off and we're left
with a nice sharp chisel again very um
same procedure with the plane but let's
take it apart our lever
cap
chip breaker and our cutting Iron same
procedure as with the bevel chisel clean
the back of the cutting
iron get rid of any resin
or any
debris bit more
oil and again 30°
angle
we can use an up down motion try to use
the whole Stone so we don't wear it in
one particular
place and again I've got that wire Edge
along the full length of the blade turn
it
around clean off your cutting
iron and
again
we have a sharp cutting IR for plan
reassembling uh the plane cutting Iron
Chip
breaker
okay and we're going to have a paral
parallel line between The Cutting Edge
and the chip breaker of anywhere between
a mil and no more than 2 mil so if we're
looking for a fine cut we're going to
bring it up to about a mil away from the
edge
we're going to tighten
that and place that back in our
plane the butt the actual screw goes
into the
pocket lock it in
place apply some pressure leave cap and
we're ready to
play
