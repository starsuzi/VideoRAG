hi everyone today I'm going to show you
how to sear off the end of your Ribbon
um most of the time we're used to seeing
you know the lighter but I have noticed
that you know the ends of my ribbon tend
to go black or just ruffle up and not
look very nice so today I'm going to
show you how to use the woodworking tool
and the first thing you need to know is
that when you're working with um high
temperatures um you need to have a metal
ruler and you need to be working on
metal and what I have here is just a a
cookie sheet turned upside
down okay so the first thing I want to
show you is um how to sear off the end
of a piece of ribbon make sure that your
um your woodworking tool
is heat it up to the highest um heat
level that it'll
go
and use the point this is the tip that
you're going to use if you're if you're
getting it in the kit like um I did
you're going to use this tip and if you
need um written instructions at any time
go ahead and go to my website
www.c
craftpro and I have you know photo phot
and written instructions there and even
links as to where you can you can get um
the same tools that I'm using if you
want
to okay so let's go ahead and sear off
the end of this ribbon you line up your
ruler as to where you want to actually
cut because you're going to be actually
cutting it and Searing it at the same
time use that point um on the end of the
tool and start off on the cookie sheet
it's a lot easier to drag it through if
you start off on the metal okay so I'm
going to put my um hot tool on the metal
and I'm just going to slowly drag it
through the
ribbon and it should be free but if I
want to make sure that it's free I'll do
it a second
time and there you have
it actually it may not be as heated up
as it should be that's one of the
reasons you need to let your Ribbon your
tool um heat up so use that point put it
on the metal and just drag it through
there we go and then just move it aside
and and your tool is going to smoke just
a little
bit okay so then you just want to make
sure that it's all clean because I like
a clean cut on my
ribbon
and you can hear that that's the
stiffness it takes it Sears it all at
once so if you have a little um loose
thread hanging you just touch it just
touch it gently with the uh um the tool
and it'll come right off but look at
that you've got a nice clean Edge to
work with um and this ribbon it's ready
to go so the other thing I want to show
you quickly today is if you want
to
see your two pieces of ribbon together
for whatever project you might have um
line up your ribbon on top of one on top
of the other and just do the same thing
take your
ruler make sure you've got all the old
pieces off of it and uh line them up the
best that you can if you want them
centered you know try to center it up
better than I'm doing here
okay so take your
ruler and put it on top of both pieces
of the
ribbon take your tool and you're going
to be using the tip start off on the
metal of your cookie sheet or whatever
piece of metal you have there and just
slowly drag the heat tool
through and you'll see that it continues
to smoke
you can run it through a couple of
different times just to make sure and
you can see they're separated
there
now me just put that
down okay so there you have your two
pieces of ribbon you can hear that
they're they're seared
together
um and whatever project you use it in
but if you need to flatten that out then
turn it over take an iron I'm just using
this this tiny little craft iron um and
just put it right on top of
your um project or your
Ribbon do it on both
sides and it will flatten it out for
you and there you have it your two
pieces of ribbon are connected
Ed and that's all I have for you today
