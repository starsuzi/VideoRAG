hi guys it's Kristen I'm here today with
a quick DIY I'm going to be making faux
mercury glass so um I've never done this
before and if it doesn't work out I'm
still going to put the video up just so
you can see what not to do but what
you're going to need is this
um this uh spray paint it's called kryon
Looking Glass it's a really small can
and it's kind of expensive it's like $8
or $9 but if it does um produce like a
mercury glass effect then it would be
worth it um just because there's so many
like glass pieces at the Dollar Tree
that would look so high-end if they were
mercury glass so I'm excited to try it
and um this is actually from the Dollar
Tree this is a
vase um I'm going to be putting flowers
in it tonight to give to my parents um
as an early Valentine's Day gift and
you're going to need a spray bottle this
is from the Dollar Tree and it has equal
parts white vinegar and water so I did
about 3/4 of a cup of each and then
you're going to need paper towels and um
just like either cardboard or newspaper
to spray on top of so I'm going to take
you outside with me um and you can just
kind of watch along and see see how it
goes okay you guys I'm outside um I have
my vase sitting on some newspaper and
I'm going to lightly spray it with my
mixture um apparently you want the water
to kind of bead up not um not
quite like drip down so I'm going to do
it from a
distance just very
lightly and I'm so sorry if you can hear
my puppy crying in the background he
sees us outside and he wants to come
out so I've got my um water and vinegar
on there and now going of shake up the
spray paint we're going to spray paint
it and then immediately after spray
painting we're going to want to lightly
blot with a paper
towel and we might need to repeat this
so just trial and error we'll see how it
goes
I don't know if it's this
[Music]
SP so we're going to go back
in with the
vinegar lightly spray it
again
and lightly
plot yeah I see like the mercury glass
effect I wish the paint was a little bit
thicker so you only had to do one
coat
but I think maybe after like three to
four coats this should
be
good I also saw on Pinterest that a lot
of people do this um for center pieces
at weddings
instead of like spending you know big
bucks for mercury glass bases for their
flower center
pieces go back in with the spray
paint
so that
does look kind of like mercury glass
um the spots that were dripping I don't
really like that might go in with a
really light layer of spray paint
without actually doing the vinegar kind
of just to cover that up and yeah that's
really
cool just going to do one last layer of
spray paint without any
vinegar
I guess we'll let that
dry okay guys this is the final product
I just put
some um pink tulips they're like pink
and white I got them at Kroger for I
think $112 and then I tied um a bur laap
bow
um here's what it looks like kind of up
close hopefully that's in
focus and this is just what I'm giving
my parents for Valentine's Day even
though this to me is a little bit more
um I don't know
eastery and I'm so sorry if this is out
of focus um let me show you what it
looks like compared to like a
store-bought mercury glass
so let me grab this little thing here's
a little store-bought mercury glass that
I have
um the one that I made is a little bit
more see-through I guess you could
always spray paint the inside of the jar
first or the vase first I just chose not
to do that because I didn't know how the
flowers would react like if they would
die immediately if they got like you
know residue from the spray paint I
think it's pretty um similar I would
definitely do this again um I think this
would be really awesome um to do with
something that you're not going to be
putting live flowers in because I think
that is like you would get the the best
results from spray painting the inside
of the glass
first and so yeah that's it guys um I'm
not going to be leaving it there because
as I said it is a gift for my parents
but that's kind of how it looks at a
distance and thank you so much for
watching if you have any questions
please feel free to leave them in the
comments below I'm going to try to leave
a detailed um instruction guide in the
description box since I kind of just did
this um spur the moment without really
thinking it entirely through so thank
thank you again for watching and I will
see you back in my next video
