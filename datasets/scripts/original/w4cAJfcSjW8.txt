hi guys shocks here and welcome back to
I saw it on the internet so I had to try
it playlist
um today I am going to try to blow up a
balloon using a water bottle some
vinegar and some baking soda
um
followed a few things around the
internet so let's give it a try and see
how amazing this is gonna be awesome
here we go all right guys so what we're
gonna need for this little experiment is
a balloon
some baking soda
baking soda
um a little funnel and a spoon because
we're gonna put the baking soda into the
balloon
and then we need some white vinegar Doo
a bigger funnel or a different funnel I
just my other funnel is larger and a
water bottle or a pop bottle
and a one-half cup measuring cup
so basically what the idea is is to put
the baking soda in the balloon put the
vinegar in the bottle flip the balloon
over and science happens and it blows up
the balloon for you so I am going to do
it and see how it works out here we go
all right so we've got the balloon here
I'm just going to stick the funnel into
the opening
and then
just gonna put in two teaspoons here
of this baking soda
kind of tap it around so it goes down
there we go
get in there
sometimes there's air so it won't go
there we go
now that's in there we're going to set
that aside
so now we're just gonna put the funnel
into the water bottle
and I've measured out a half cup of
vinegar
and we're going to set that aside
whoa
you know here's the tricky part
you want to make sure the baking soda
stays in the bottom of your balloon so
squeeze the air out
okay then you're gonna put the the top
of your balloon over the top of this and
leave the balloon hanging sideways
kind of tricky but spread it out in your
fingers
just over the top see I was hanging
sideways
okay now that we're ready to do this
let's have a look
again tip your balloon
so it fills up the water bottle maybe a
half a cup of vinegar was too much
hey that's really awesome
pinch the balloon whoops
pull it down
Ty you've got a balloon
feels a lot denser than uh
when you blow it up with air but that's
because of the gas that's created from
the baking soda and the vinegar
wow was that ever cool okay I've set
another one up so we can look at it from
a different angle
all right let's have a look at this
another time
oh
foreign
so I think this is just a one-time use
type thing
and the balloons do not float
but they do fill up with
gas
pretty cool
are you ready last time
all right that's pretty cool fun party
tricks show your friends
very interesting indeed
all right guys that was so much fun
thank you for coming with me to check
this out and you know see how it works
the balloons don't float
so it's not like a helium or anything
um and they're heavy they turned out a
lot heavier than if you were to blow
them up with her but check that out that
is so cool thanks again you guys for
watching make sure you give the video a
thumbs up like And subscribe I'd love to
see you around here more
and stick around uh you never know what
kind of crazy Randomness we're gonna get
up to next
alright guys we'll see you next time bye
so it's been about half an hour maybe 45
minutes since I recorded
and this thing is still full of error so
I think I'm gonna hold off a little bit
longer and see how this ends up
it's been about an hour and a half and
this thing is finally
decompressed here
not a whole lot left going on give it a
shake there we go thank you so much for
watching and yeah about an hour and a
half is how long that stayed up for out
here in the Sun so I hope you give it a
try I hope you have fun like And
subscribe and we'll see you next time on
the I saw it on the internet and had to
give it a try playlist
all right
