hi this is Kelly with the Suburban
swipbox.com and I'm back today with a
reader request a couple weeks ago I made
Parmesan crisps that were spiced with an
everything bagel spice and they are too
die for so today I'm going to teach you
how to make Parmesan crisps just plain
with just one ingredient a hunk of
cheese to start your parmesan Cris
you're going to take parmesan regano and
a box grater and I like to use this side
of the Box grader it's kind of um a
little ruffly I have no idea how to
describe that but I feel like that gets
the um consistency I'm looking for for
the parmesan crisp so you're just going
to grate about a cup of cheese maybe
more depends on how many crisps you're
looking to make um these make a great
holiday appetizer let me tell you
they're so simple and we're going to the
it's all day
to once you have your
cheese you're going to use heaping
tablespoons and make little
piles on a baking sheet that's lined
with either parchment paper or a s
patn and I kind of just like mine free
form but if you're looking for
Perfection you can use a biscuit cutter
and you can place that on there and just
fill the little Wells with your
cheese and again don't put too much
cheese because it won't melt and they
won't become crisp they'll kind of just
be chewy and that's not a good thing so
once you have all of your CRPS crisp on
the baking sheet you're going to be able
to fit about eight on here and you're
going to Pat them down
lightly and then you're going to
transfer the baking sheet to the oven
they're going to bake for about 5 to 8
minutes just until they're crisp and
gold ground they're going to look like
this when they're
done once your parmesan CS are done
baking they'll be crisp and golden brown
just like this perfect for snacking
