hi everyone Renee here welcome to my
YouTube channel today I'm going to show
you how to make these cute minion
Oreos start by melting some candy melts
these are merkens brand in the microwave
until they're nice and liquidy if you
don't have candy colors and want to
deepen the color or color your chocolate
mix shortening with powdered food color
or petal dusts with a padet knife until
it's well incorpor ated and you have
your own DIY candy
[Music]
color and now I have a yellow color that
I think is more minion
[Music]
likee you can use your favorite flavor
Oreo and I'm going to use a mold but you
could also just dip these with the mold
just fill a little in the bottom of each
cavity
[Music]
give the tray a tap to pop any air
bubbles just plop your Oreo into each
cavity and press gently to set it down
into the
[Music]
chocolate and give the tray another
tap now just fill in the sides and the
top with more of the yellow
[Music]
chocolate then just set the tray aside
or pop it in the refrigerator for a few
minutes to set
up then all you do is release the Oreos
from the
mold
now to bring these minions to life pipe
two eyes with outline consistency white
royal
icing and go right down on top of the
white immediately with a warm brown
royal icing the same
consistency and finally a little dot of
black and just give the cookie a little
tap to level the
icing my favorite minions are the
Cyclops min to make these ones pipe a
single larger white
dot then add the brown
[Music]
Dot and black
dot when the eyes have had a chance to
set completely outline them with gray
royal icing to form the
goggles
now I'll go around a second time to
build up the height without adding a lot
of thickness to the
[Music]
outline
[Music]
now give the minion's hair with thicker
black World
[Music]
icing
[Music]
add straps to the goggles with a thicker
black War
icing
[Music]
and don't forget to give them Smiles or
other
[Music]
expressions
[Music]
and an optional last step is to paint
the rim of the gray goggle with a paint
made from edible silver Luster Dust
mixed with vodka you could of course
just leave them gray but I like this
shiny
touch and that's
it
