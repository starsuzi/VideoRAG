here we go using a heat gun 1500 WTS I'm
going to use this on high also we have
these little plastic disposable scrapers
here made out of plastic the only thing
I use this for is to start lifting off
the sticker then the rest will come off
by hand the weather damaged ones on the
trunk I may have to scrape them with
this once uh you're done scraping it
there'll be a glue residue you have to
take that off as
well here we
go
goal of this heat gun is to keep it
moving if you stop and you bubble the
sticker or the paint it's going to be a
mess so like I said the goal is to keep
it
[Applause]
moving I like to do the outside
first kind of loosen it
up work my way around
it it's a double layer sticker so
there's basically a sticker on top of a
sticker and with with this technique I'm
going to try to get both off at the same
time like I said keep that heat gun
moving this is factory paint if it
wasn't uh I could very easily damage it
bubbling in if I left it in place too
long Factory paint's a little bit more
[Applause]
durable
[Applause]
try to do two at once here
[Applause]
surface is very
hot
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
moving
on see if I can show you the stripes
[Applause]
[Applause]
now same technique
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
he
[Applause]
w
[Applause]
always keep this thing moving once you
start bubbling the stick you're melting
in and it turns into a huge mess so keep
it moving all you're trying to do is
heat it up now melt it
off
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
J
[Applause]
different part here this is actually a
sticker on top of a
sticker I'm going to take off the center
sticker here first and then do the
outside
[Applause]
sticker hopefully I can get this off all
in one
piece
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
a
[Applause]
think you you guys have seen enough of
that I'll show you the uh trunk L to
True
mess all right getting close
here I did change techniques and get a a
little bit more aggressive here I am now
switching over to a plastic razor
blade it's basically a razor blade made
out of
plastic and it's actually working quite
well I don't think it's damaging in the
finish
so let me show you these last three uh
[Applause]
letters
Center's coming off quite
easily cuz it was a double sticker and
the heat didn't get to it as
much
but the outside is just baked down
[Applause]
there
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
and one last
[Applause]
one
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
yeah
as you can see this last technique I'm
using with this razor blade is actually
uh plastic razor blade is very
aggressive I don't think I damag to
finish it all I'm going to make another
video show you how to remove all the
sticker goop there's a bunch of white
spray paint on the car as well that
needs to come
off let me show you the
car
all that sticker goop is still on
there white spray paint all over the
trim and on the
body and other side looks the same way I
think I got about an hour and a half in
stripping this whole car probably half
hour that in the trunk
lid and I'll probably have another hour
of uh sticker goop removal which I think
was the worst
part all right look forward to my next
video
