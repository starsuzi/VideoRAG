hi I'm chef Tom today I'm making this
call brat special is a special hoisin
chicken stir-fry is some vegetable first
of all we're gonna stir fry the chicken
until some I cook nice high heat in the
frying pans little oil not much I care
about eight ounce of chicken here Korean
boneless skinless white eat chicken
slices chicken and i marinate it with a
little bit a white and a couple
teaspoons of the cornstarch to make it
nice and tender so let's stir fry so
maybe two minutes right the chicken
apart like this
every time were you surprised protein
when you're at some meat in it
ten you don't want to stir right away
I'm telling for light smoothies four to
five seconds nice the chickens really
tender almost there you want the outside
light light going down and he's like
you're king and the hoisin chicken some
people you like to make it with the
breaded chicken deep frying which is
fine too all right almost done we're
gonna stay on the side
you set the chicken on the side putting
in a nice calendar and then have a
little stainless steel bowl catching the
extra like oil or water or juice let
them drip rest for a couple minutes at
the meantime I just use a paper towel to
clean my walk and now I'm going to still
find it
vegetable oil ginger and garlic if you
like spicy I would like to add either me
pal sweet and chili sauce I think
they'll be good for poison chicken or
the chicken is makin my poison
to exploit you all night beautiful no so
good I'm gonna add some vegetable well
this is I like to use bell pepper and
onion keep hot you have a nice texture
color and the onion actually give them a
little sweet flavor - and the solely the
bell pepper stir fry for a minute not
long
okay now we can revisit the chicken and
the chicken in
oh okay now we're gonna add some toy box
I could okay
and poison sauce
poison sauce is make out from the
soybeans they call sweet soybean paste
no it's so good yeah
very simple easy to make
let that cook for like one minute you
see the chickens nice and tender
now this at Cheers a little stock not
much maybe one out like this
oh yeah
when they saw it bring up to a boil just
a little bit on top
none of it like this the thoughtful
everything from the sweet chili
before you serve this Emma creepy
Oh yummy all right
this is done ready to serve
chicken with hoisin sauce you can
substitute with other vegetable but the
sauce basically that's how you cook it
and if you want to some recipe they call
for fried chicken you can use that if
you don't like the spicy just don't get
a hot sauce get a try
