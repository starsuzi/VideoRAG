hello I'm Evan toppel corporate chef of
Emir Roth USA Today I'm going to show
you the safest and most effective way of
breaking down a wheel of Roth Grand
crew we are going to go through the very
uh most effective pieces of knife and
Cutlery to break down the wheel the most
common piece is the 12-in chef knife
um that is available in any food service
or retail format um something that may
be available to you is a larger 18-in
knife which would be referred to as a
pizza knife um the next option which
would be excellent would be a double-
handled Cheese Knife um some operations
have that more common in
retail but the most effective piece
which most people do not have is what we
call a platform cutter and it's simply a
platform with a piano wire uh on the
inside and used as the cutting
instrument and what we do is we take and
with a pairing knife or your chef's
knife is we lightly and carefully score
the rind on top so we have a nice line
to follow for our cut we also we're
going to take and make a a nice downward
score on both sides because the Rind can
be rather
tough so we're going to make about a/ in
cut and what this is going to do it's
going to allow us to place the wire in
place and draw it up through there and
have a nice clean Edge so we'll move
this in the
position pull our wire
back place our wheel over the
top we will line up our wire into the
pre-scored
line line up the back
and we do a
nice slow even
pull and the wire slides directly
through the cheese breaking our wheel in
half so what we're going to do is show
you how to break it down with the chef
knife because that is the most common
piece of
equipment what we like to do the first
cut we will be taking and scoring gently
across the top face in
half and we have a nice score Mark to
follow our Cuts
acrossed uh at that point we want to
make sure that we do this safely and the
most dangerous part of the knife is
because it's so close to the size of the
wheel is the chance that you will slip
off the front edge of the knife and and
and injure yourself on the palm so what
we're going to do to alleviate that
chance is we're going to bring the knife
back we're going to tip it up at a 45째
angle and we're going to slowly Rock The
Knife along the score line down through
the cheese this is a very cold cheese so
you do feel some resistance but you
continually put pressure and rock and
you'll feel when it pops through on the
other side now we'll bring the knife
back up at the 45 and it'll remove
fairly easily now we'll spin the cheese
around and we do the exact same motion
45 we start to rock the knife through
bring our hand back on the back part of
the
knife and easily go through and break
the wheel into two pieces so now what we
have obviously is two half wheels of
grand crew so we'll set one of these
aside and we'll continue breaking this
down into smaller pieces
first thing we're going to do is we are
going to try and find the safest surface
and what the safest surface always is is
the flat a surface so we're going to
move our wheel into position to be flat
and because this surface is cut it's
also fairly sticky on the cutting board
so we can move it in position like that
we're going to eyeball and break the
wheel in half and we're going to make a
simple and smooth rocking motion
right down through the center of this
half wheel that's going to provide
us with quarters we move from a half to
quarter
Cuts so from the quarter cut there are
several different options the first
option we're going to do now we are not
able to actually cut on a flat surface
anymore so we have to be very careful
about the movement of the wheel but
we're going to take the very
same um we're going to take the very
same procedure we're going to put our
knife at a 45 we're going to indent it
in the tip and we're going to rock back
and forth straight down having our knife
following the very tip of the quarter
wheel and we're going to break this
quarter into
Ace from that point we can do two
different cuts one cut we call the cake
cut one cut we call the pie cut first
we'll do the the cake cut again because
of its motion we have a couple options
now that we're getting
smaller we can take a clean towel place
it on The Cutting Board this keeps our
piece of cheese from tipping or sliding
around as we're trying to cut it again
we'll line up to the tip of the cheese
the knife 45째 angle we will indent with
a little slicing motion and again we'll
motion Rock back and forth down through
the length of the
cheese now at this point from the
quarter you can break it into four more
pieces or three pieces depending on the
size that you would like so what I did
is I broke it into three
pieces and it's is going to provide
roughly a 10 o piece which we call a
Kake cut because of it size looking like
a stacked layered cake those are our
cake
cuts and the other cut we're going to
show is the pie cut the pie cut can be
very similar but at this point we are
able to lay it down on a flat surface
which is the safest surface to cut on
we're going to break this piece into a
half again using the rocking motion
slowly evenly and you notice how I have
watching my palm from the point of the
knife that's why we're using the longer
knife from this point we can again set
them down to the largest flat
surface and we will break this into
thirds
once
twice and we have what we call a pie cut
because obviously it's shape of a
pie
now we're going to go through a very
simple process of breaking down the
Primal cuts into single service
applications uh those single Ser
applications would be good for catering
Banquets appetizers cheese course plates
so we're going to do that very simply
and easily by taking the Primal cuts and
breaking them
down our first cut is going to be a
diamond shaped cut and to do that we are
going to break this eighth cut
wheel into a
16th and what that does for us is it
gives us a nice point a point at a 45
and I'll show you how to gather that 45
so what we're going to do is take a
parallel cut about a/2 inch
in again rocking the knife straight down
through and what it gives us is a
straight line with a 45째 angle
angle we're going to very carefully trim
very little of the Rind
off and we're going to place the knife
at a 45 to the original piece of cheese
move in 1/2 inch keeping that 45째
angle and cutting again at a half
inch and one more
time and what that gives us is this
diamond shape and at that point point we
can take the diamond shape lay it
down make our 1/ in cuts
across and it results in half in by half
in by half in diamond shapes which is a
very
unique way to use a wheel product
because the wheel product when you cut
it has lots of nice angles and lots of
nice shape it's a very fun way to do
that uh it's much harder to do that out
of a square piece so take advantage of
the round shape of this wheel the other
option that we have is we can do a stick
we can do a short stick or a long stick
uh again we'll move a half inch in make
it about a/ inch
thick cut this time we're going to leave
the r what we're going to do is we're
going to trim up the end nice and
square we're going to move a half onch
in make our sticks
and we're going to leave the Rind for
two reasons we're going to be able to
show them that this is a wash rind
product and it also serves as a serving
instrument knowing which end to grab and
you can eat up until the Rin so it makes
a very nice display it's very
interesting it gives very much the
history and detail of how the cheese was
produced and it gives you a different
look and tone on the plate when you're
doing that sort of uh presentation the
last shape we we'll show is a simple
Square which would be called a cube we
can do them a larger smaller we're going
to stay with the same size roughly a/
inch we're going to barely trim off the
nice rind
unfortunately and we're simply going to
make half inch cubes
cutting in each Direction moving the
knife a half
inch and we
have our cheese
cubes let's talk a little bit about
portion control and portion size um now
that we've just cut up and we've made
the different shapes uh available for
use for catering and cheese plates and
such um normal portion size would range
between a/ an oun
and 3/4 of an ounce per piece of cheese
something like this a little larger
would probably be in the 3/4 ounce range
something like this a little smaller and
these two would be in the half ounce
range normally on a catered event uh
with a long event with many other
options of food you'd probably serve
between an ounce and an ounce and a half
per person on a smaller event that chees
is maybe more the focus you would bump
that up to approximately two to 2 and
1/2 o per
person let's take a moment and go over
how to properly store the product we
just cut up the most convenient and
easiest thing would probably be plastic
wrap it's easy to use and readily
available for larger pieces of cheese
you could consider using wax paper or
parchment
paper however we do not recommend that
you use a vac seal on this wash rine
cheese as it will suffocate the product
let's take a look at how to wrap a
larger piece such as
this we're going to pull
out a large piece of plastic
wrap place the cheese in the
center and
carefully wrap each side pulling the
plastic rack tightly and then we're
going to want to seal out as much
air smoothing it out with our hand as we
possibly can and what we want to do
again is we're going to take another
piece we're going to put the piece of
cheese in a different
direction and we're going to completely
wrap it a second time this serves two
purposes one it does not let
refrigerator smells penetrate your
cheese and two does not let the cheese
Aroma penetrate your refrigerator now
this type this cheese would be able to
be stored for a couple weeks and and the
best spot would be in a very cold corner
of your

refrigerator
