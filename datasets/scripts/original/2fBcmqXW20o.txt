we have a clog
sink so what I'm going to try to do is
use the plunger first let's see if that
works this sink obviously you can see
water runs through just
fine the garbage disposed
aside it's
clogged so we going to do is fill this
sink up a little bit with water
stick the drain stopper in there and
hold it while I plunge this
side this ha I'm going to try to put it
around in the drain so it seals really
well if not it'll compress anyway and
I'm going to hold the other
side
going to have to do it a few times to
try to get whatever's in there move
it obiously try not to make a
mess I'm going to try to hold the
plunger down cuz I'm not getting a good
seal
oh I hear
bubbling that bubbling must have been my
stomach nothing
happened
yep there's
bubbling let's try this let's see what
[Music]
happens oh there we
go let's make sure this
is so the trick
is I put a little water in here just
um that way I would be able to see if
this is ceiling if if air bubbles up
then I would know but as you plunge it
you want to hold this down because the
pipes are connected and if you don't you
may get some back back splash up through
here so I was doing this I couldn't get
a good seal so when I pushed down
instead of just pushing down I also had
to seal better seal as I was pulling up
so as it goes back and forth just do it
a few times you can see it didn't take
very long
