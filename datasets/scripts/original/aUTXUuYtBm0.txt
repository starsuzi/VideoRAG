flour like 1.5 kg flour you can use half
of the one kg flour so with
[Music]
the you mix in your
margarine this flour is about 6 tbspoon
full of plain flour so I'm using 3
tbspoon full of margarine half half of
the quantity of the flour of margarine
and then you add your
salt one t spoonful of salt you can
still taste it when you rub it in and
then of course your
nutmeg so you're going to wrap this one
in with your two Clean

this is how it look after rubbing in
your Marine it's not very rich just
Sandy texture so at this step I'm going
to blend my garlic and onion to spice it
