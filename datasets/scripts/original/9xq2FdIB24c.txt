hi guys it's Michaela today I have a
tutorial on how to make this awesome
wine bottle light that's above my head
um yeah so it's super cool it's super
unique it's really easy to do it's it's
inexpensive um it's a little time
consuming but totally worth
it so yeah if you want to see how to
make this light just keep
watching for your supplies you'll need a
wine bottle hot glue and little marbles
like flat uh ones that are flat on one
side I went with silver and
clear um next you'll need to take the
label off of your wine bottle you can
use googan to help remove any sticky
residue um you can leave the label on if
you want I chose to take it
off so scrub it clean and make sure it's
dry before you start gluing your little
things
on so here I'm just gluing on the
marbles um there's no really Rhyme or
Reason how I do it I just pick them and
glue them
on and there's my
doggy so I don't really do a pattern I
just grab
whatever um I don't really want them to
be like I want all silver ones right
next to each other
but I don't want it to be too uniform so
that's that's me showing you my bottle
so
far
um and yeah just keep
gluing it's pretty time
consuming but you just got to glue glue
glue um you can see that there's some
like little spots in my between my
marbles um you don't want them too close
together or they will knock each other
off so here's my finished bottle and I
forgot to show the Christmas lights in
my first clip so you also need Christmas
lights to put
inside um there's really
no way to do this you just kind of have
to stuff the light in there I use a
chopstick to
help um just you just got to get it in
there
it's a little hard but you get the hang
of it after a little while all right
