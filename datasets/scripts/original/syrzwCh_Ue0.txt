hi this is skarga and today what I'm
going to do is show you a quick cooking
tip that if you ever uh slice onions up
die some onions up and y'all for some
reason like if you're like me you get a
smell on your hands I want to show you
how to get rid of that smell what you do
is you take some salt just with your
hands take some salt pour the salt on
your hand and rub it together and just
wash your hands with the sauce
i rubbing your hands with the salt it
would take all the onion smell out of
your hands and you won't have that uh
lingering on this is Skagen appreciate
all your viewers and subscribers out
there and y'all take care
