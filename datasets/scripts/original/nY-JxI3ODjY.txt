Hi foodies, I'm Yuda Bustara
Today I'm gonna be making
Chicken Cordon Bleu
The first step is
Butterfly the chicken
Split into two
And usually I take out the fat
If your chicken is already like this,
Now it's time to pound the chicken
I use parchment paper,
Then pound it
And the result will be like this,
Flat and thin
Rub a little bit mustard
So it will tastes more savoury
You can skip it if you don't have mustard
You can substitute to tomato or chili paste
Salt and pepper
100 grams of smoked beef
Typical of Chicken cordon bleu 
is, it has cheese in it
I got mozarella stick
But you can use gruyere,
cheddar, or any kind of cheese you have
200 grams of mozarella cheese
It's time to cover the chicken 
with flour, egg yolk, and bread crumb
To make it becomes more savoury,
Don't forget to add salt and pepper
on every part of it
This is it, chicken cordon bleu
