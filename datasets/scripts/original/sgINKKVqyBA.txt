hi guys this is Chas and today I'm going
to be showing you how to clean your fair
scers you'll need some
Q-tips cup of
water and that's it so you're going to
start off you're going to take your
Q-tips get a small handful cuz you don't
know how many you'll need dip the ends
in water cuz it could hurt their ears if
you
don't squeeze all the excess water out
cuz you don't want to put
too much water in their
ears and then my parent is actually
asleep so I'm going to try to do it
while she's
asleep so I got my Q-tip
I work her up
and you don't want to go down too far
cuz it could
hurt you just want to gently and you may
have to Scruff
them
gently go over the little
crevices in their
ears scruffing does not hurt
them it's a natural reaction for them to
Yaar always make sure you can see the
end of the
Q-tip when cleaning their
ears make sure you get both
ears clean them very
well come here

up okay

you clean a ferret's ears and I'll be
making another video thank you bye
