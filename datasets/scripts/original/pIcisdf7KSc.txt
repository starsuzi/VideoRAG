hi everybody this is jen from
cookiescupcakesandcardio.com
i have in front of me a baby cakes cake
pop maker and what i'm going to do today
is review how you use it and what you
can make when you're using it
and the reason i have it is because i
was downtown at our local department
store which we also call canadian tire
yes it sells tires and cake pop machines
can you imagine canada is a great place
and it was about 40 off and so i got
that and the cupcake maker that i
reviewed in a previous video
and so i wanted to show you something
that's a neat little kind of like a tool
that you can use if you're doing simple
baking so i'm going to get started talk
you through this and let you know what
it can do
so what you'll find coming with your
cake pop machine are two different sizes
of cake pop sticks a fork tool
the manual and a drying rack in the
manual you will find smaller recipes for
less batter which comes in handy since
making the cake pops they tend to be on
the small side but i've gone ahead and
whipped up my favorite batch of
chocolate cake which you can find on our
channel if you'd like to try and what
i'm going to do now is preheat the
machine so inside we've got the domes
with the cake pops will bake into but
what you want to do is plug it in and
when the two lights come on that's when
it's going to be ready to put the batter
in so when that happens i'll be back to
show you that process
so before you get too far into the
preheating process and the
the maker gets too hot you just want to
make sure you rub the insides of the
domes with some non-stick cooking spray
this will just help with the
balls coming out a little bit easier
the first couple times should work fine
with the teflon but needs a little help
the rest of the time through
so once it's preheated fully
you can
put in your batter now in the cake pop
maker what you're going to do is fill up
one of the domes
completely to the top and level so it's
about one and a quarter
of my spoons here which um is a
tablespoon amount so it's just about a
tablespoon so what i've been
experimenting with before was what
happens if i didn't put enough what
happens if i put too much
if you don't put enough they don't
become perfect round balls and if you
put too much it spills out the side but
you still end up with a pretty decent
product
so i'm just going to fill these
and close the lid for the baking time
which we're going to bake for about five
minutes
so the cake pops have finished cooking
and i'm just going to use the fork tool
to just kind of poke them in the side
and work them free
they should come out relatively easy
with the non-stick spray
but you still probably have to be quite
gentle
so i'm just going to pull all these out
and let them cool on this cooling rack
and then i'll be back to show you what
you're going to need in order to
decorate your cake pops
while the cake pops are cooling i'm
going to gather the ingredients that i
need for the next step of the process so
i'm going to need my cake pop sticks
some sprinkles for decorating you can
use whatever you would like to and some
melting wafers these happen to be white
chocolate melting wafers you can use
candy melts you can use chocolate chips
you can use baking chocolate that's
totally up to you what the cake pop is
going to do is be dipped in the melted
chocolate so what i have to do first
while they're dry while they're cooling
is melt the chocolate melting the
chocolate is going to happen one minute
intervals for at 50 power in the
microwave when they're cool and the
chocolate is melted i'll be back to show
you the next step
so once your cake pops are cooled and
your chocolate is liquid what you're
going to do is take your cake pop stick
and you're going to dip it into the
chocolate
pull it straight out just so you've got
the end coated nicely
and then this is going to act as the
cement into the cake pop so you're going
to stick it in there and just about a
quarter of the way into the pop and then
just leave it there so i'm going to do
all of these
and then pop them into the freezer
and they're going to freeze
for about
i'd say five to ten minutes and then we
will do the final decorating process
okay so the cake pops have been in the
freezer for about five to ten minutes
and what you want to make sure is that
the anchor here the stick is solidly
stuck to the cake pop so what i'm going
to do now is into my melted chocolate
i'm going to just straight in put my
cake pop and i'm just going to make sure
that the chocolate is meeting up with
that anchor
and slowly bring it out
and i'm now i'm going to make sure the
excess chocolate comes off of the cake
pop so i'm just going to let it
rotate here and drip
until i have enough chocolate off that
it doesn't make a big mess when i put it
into the stand
so i think it's dropped most of the
excess chocolate off and what i'm going
to do now is dip it into my sprinkles
you can put it into any topping that you
would like to and i'm just going to put
it in at an angle and just slowly work
around
getting the sides
and the top coated
and then i'm going to turn it
around to dry completely
in the
cake pop stand so i'm going to finish
off the rest of these and then i'll be
back to finish off the video
so we finished decorating all of our
cake pops and i really like the way that
the cake pop maker enables you to have a
perfectly round ball without having to
roll all those individual balls when
you're making cake pops we do have
another video that can show you how to
make cake pops without having to use the
cake pop machine but it's a nice handy
thing to use to have in your kitchen
especially if you have young bakers in
your house
just be careful that when you're lifting
the lid up that you use it with a mitt
especially if you're around little kids
so we know lots of our younger viewers
like to try fun things out like this so
i hope you enjoyed this video on baby
cakes cake pops let me know if you've
ever tried the machine curious to know
if you've had the same results if you
liked the video please share it with all
of your friends and you can find us on
