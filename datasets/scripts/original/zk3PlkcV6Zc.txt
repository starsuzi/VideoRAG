hi welcome back to Susan's Kitchen
corner on today's episode we're going to
be making egg sunny side up which is
really extremely easy so all we need is
olive oil or butter i p i perturbed no I
don't perturb I prefer to use olive oil
cuz butter is a little bit more iffy if
you don't watch it it burns
so we got our nonstick pan now if you
don't have a non-stick pan it's better
to use butter and you can still use
olive oil which is a lot more healthier
um so here's what we're going to do
we're going to point the camera down so
you can see what I'm doing we're going
to turn this on
medium pour just a little bit of olive
oil in there cuz we just want to coat
it even though it has nonstick is just
to add extra
extra uh extra
something well let's see if I can
remember what I was going to
say it makes it healthier there we
go so we're going to crack our first egg
in now remember I got this on um medium
check the second egg
open and what we're going to do is let
me get my little pointer stick
here send side up you see this this part
right here though it's clear well we
want to make that opaque so we're going
to cook it we're going to let it cook
even though it's on high we're going let
it cook right now and as soon as you
see little Bubbles and it starts to take
off see those bubbles right there we
don't want to burn the
bottom we're going to take this off the
heat
so see in there you can see it bubbling
underneath hope you can see that so
we're going to take it right
off she let's sit it right here so you
can still see it and we're going to let
it cook
now we're going to turn this down to
medium
low gently
eggs eggs you just bring it up to heat
let boil now you can see it's not
boiling as much keep your hand away well
keep my hand away from the uh
burner so wait till those little bubbles
start to
go less less less less less less and
then we're going to bring it right back
onto the
heat cuz we do not want to burn the
bottom unless you like burnt
bottoms so it's going to bring the
temperature back
up it's a slow process this would you
get a little bit more patience get you
get perfect
eggs and as you can see in here guess
what's happening this is starting to go
opaque so we're going to wait until that
travels all the way
across to the
yolk it's already done it
here going to turn this down to low
now so
gently every time I cook I think of
scenes from Red TW so right now I'm
thinking gently boil the scallops so if
you watch R to I watch it too many times
I got the I got I got it
memorized so this is kind of thing so
take it off the
heat it's okay there's no there's no
there's
no there's no now depending what you got
the heat on right here but depending how
you like
it you you can stop it right here if you
like it runny
now actually what you can do
now put a lid on
it and let it
sit for a while so let's watch egg sit
with a lid on it and let me lift this up
here for a minute now you can see how
it's
traveling if you can see that it's it's
traveled the whole so we're just going
to leave it like that let's turn this
burner off
and let it do its do its thing cuz it's
going to steam up
here now if you want to do this
fast you're going to probably get a
little bit of a
burnt burnt egg actually let's put it
right back on the it's not on the heat
it's
off this is the most exciting video ever
watching
eggs
okay that looks done so here we
go we got perfect
opaque rings around here depending on
your depending on your taste you could
have them a little bit more a little bit
less let's get these onto a plate and
examine
them oh
oh okay so very very
carefully now see they already have a
they already have
a split down the
middle let's grab one of these
carefully see the other one's trained to
stick in I don't know if you've seen
that but the other one's trained to
stick in the
um the other one I had this other one
perfectly
trained to stay in
position
so let's check the
bottom bottom this one's
hard if you can see that bottom is nice
and white not I hope you can see that
like that it's it's a little
yellow it's nice so it's not burnt and
as you can see there's no burnt edges so
this is my eggs sunny side up I'm going
to enjoy these so I hope you
watch Being tongue twisted
again hope you enjoyed the video
toodles
