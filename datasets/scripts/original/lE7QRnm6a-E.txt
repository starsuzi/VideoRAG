salt olive
oil and finally sliced beef now
traditionally it's it's lamb but of
course we're making beef shorma so it's
beef and for our toppings we have
cucumbers tomatoes onion and cabbage and
some people don't like cabbage in it and

simply leave it out homemade tahini
sauce and if you want to find out how to

beef by adding the

spices olive
oil and using a glove in our hand we're
going to mix this until it's well
combined now we're going to cover this
and we're going to leave it sit in the
fridge for about 4 hours actually
overnight is
preferred after our beef is marinated
we're going to place it into a baking
tray going to cover it with aluminum
foil and we're going to put this into a
400Â°
oven after 20 minutes we're going to
remove it from the
oven going to remove the foil and we're
going to drain some of this excess water
off once the excess water is drained off
now we'll just slip this back in the
oven again for another 10 to 15 minutes
until it's nicely
browned after about 12 minutes we're
going to remove it from the
oven and this is going to be
delicious that we'll just let it cool
