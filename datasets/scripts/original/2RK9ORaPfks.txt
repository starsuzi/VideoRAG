hi everybody today we're going to show
you how to cook uh the KFC Fried Chicken
I'm here with my brother Alexander hi so
um what do you have to say about that
recipe well the recipe uh I was in a
trip down K I went there to see a Col
Sanders's grave and at the bright ideal
of dig his grade up and Soo his recipe
so let's start the show by showing you
the special ingredient you will need in
order to cook that wonderful meal
[Music]
1 tbspoon of Basil one tbspoon of
margar 1 tbsp of black pepper 1 tbsp of
white pepper one teaspoon of chili 1
tbsp of paprika 1 tbsp of
taragan 3 tbsp of salt half tbspoon of
Oregon 1 tbsp of sage
one tbsp of onion powder finally 3 tbsp
of granulated
garlic the KFC fried chicken recipe well
as you already know you need 11 secret
spices we already told you what they
were so you first start you put all the
spices in a
bowl there's no specific order you just
toss everything in
there and yes uh it will look
like tons of spices even if you think
it's too much it's normal I'm going to
show it to you it's a lot of
spices so that's what it is then a
flour and you will want to mix
everything up real
good so once it's all mixed real good
should look a little bit like
that then
for the batter mix you will first want
to wet your chicken with a mix of egg
and milk so I take two
eggs with one cup of
milk going to mix it
together
this mix will help the mix of flour and
spice to uh stick on the chicken
otherwise if you don't do that it will
taste like nothing so once everything's
mixed up you're ready to start the
batter process so first you take your
piece of chicken and you dip it in the
flour and secret spices mix make sure
it's well coated all around
then you're going to dip it into the egg
and milk
mixture and redip it into the
flour we want to make sure everything's
well coated it it's not supposed to be
uh all moisty or if you have it any wet
spot make sure you just add more flour
over
it and Shake D EXs and you just put it
in
there so now it's time to cook the
chicken so basically that's the step you
might not want to do in the house
because after that uh it will smell oil
for like 3 days so um if you're lucky
enough to have like a a room separate to
the house this is where you want to be
with that so I have my um deep fryer
here set at 3 uh
20° and uh uh this will be like the
first temperature you will want to use
in the cooking and at the end of the
cooking which will be about 8 minutes
you will want to raise the temperature
to maximum temperature of your deep
fryer in my case it's 374 de to achieve
the nice golden roasted look on your
chicken so cooking time will be around
10 minutes or 160°
fah internal chicken temperature so you
can use a digital thermometer if you
want to make sure what's the appropriate
temperature so you don't get sick eating
your chicken to a
raw our
Ki stolen
recipe out of there I'm just going
to pick the thermometer in there you
want to make sure you're touching the
bones and there you can see the'll need
needle coming up until we're want to
reach 160 or so so I call this
[Music]
cook so you're ready to enjoy your
finger liing good Chicken KFC chicken

like the KFC chicken skin all flaky and
