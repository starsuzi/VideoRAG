hello everyone and welcome to my youtube
channel today we're making apple crumble
you're going to need about 3
medium-sized cooking apples these are
Bramley's that's about five hundred and
seventy five grams once they're peeled
and cored the first thing we need to do
is preheat you
[Music]
think all the apples and then cut into
chunks and
[Music]
then place them in a bowl of water so
stop them going Brown while we make the
cable for the crumble you need 175 grams
of plain flour
110 grams of golden caster sugar
110 grams of butter and a bowl for
mixing
put the flour and sugar and butter in a
bowl and rub it with your fingertips
until the mixture looks like moist
breadcrumbs
[Music]
add two tablespoons of sugar and mix it
in with the apples
pull the crumb mix over the apples and
then use a fork or spoon to even it out
and gently press the surface with the
back of the spoon so the crumble is nice
and tight and holds together
it's now ready to go in the oven
place it in a preheated oven 35 to 45
minutes until the top is gone
[Music]
so there you have it homemade apple
crumble perfect for a cozy Alton evening
you can serve that with double cream
clotted cream or like I like to have it
with custard thanks for watching and
