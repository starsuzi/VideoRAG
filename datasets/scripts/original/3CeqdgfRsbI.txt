hey everyone welcome to Pai's kitchen if youre 
news of the show this is just my second show  
where I share with you yummy recipes that are 
outside of Thai cuisine so today I'm going to  
show you how to make crispy chicken skin which 
is super delicious and crunchy and Munchie great  
on salad or even on its own now this came up for 
me because I was making lap chicken for hot Thai  
kitchen and then I had to remove the skin from 
the chicken and I just didn't want to throw it  
away it seems like such a waste so I figured hmmm 
maybe I can turn it into crispy chicken skin and  
that's how I sort of developed this technique 
and so it only takes a few minutes so the next  
time you've got chicken skin don't throw it away 
let me show you what to do let's get started now  
unless I'm shopping for a specific recipe I tend 
to just buy bone-in skin-on chicken because it's  
much more versatile I can use it for any recipe 
if you debone it use the bones for stock you use  
the meat for your recipe and then you use the 
skin now for this crispy chicken skin so it's  
a win win and win and it's cheaper it's a little 
more work but it's worth it okay so I've got here  
bone-in skin-on chicken breast this is perfect 
for crispy chicken skin because you want the skin  
to be as big as possible because it will shrink 
quite a bit or the combo thigh and leg would be  
good as well because it's a large piece of skin 
but any chicken skin that's relatively big will  
work okay so I'm just gonna take the skin off and 
a boning knife like this is useful and it's really  
easy to take the skin off you just have to cut 
through sort of the membrane that's attached and  
it just pulls right off there we go and then this 
is really easy to debone just cut down through it  
and remove the breast that bone great for stock 
I always just throw it in a small pot of stock  
then I have it for miscellaneous use okay I'm just 
going to blanch the chicken skin just to cook it  
off and I'll show you why in a minute I've only 
got about half an inch of water in here because  
you know I don't want it to take forever to boil 
so just a little bit you just need enough to cook  
the skin which will take 20 seconds if that and 
by the way in Thailand we sell fried chicken skin  
as a snack we can buy a bag of crispy chicken skin 
but the way we do it was we deep-fry it so if you  
have if you see a vendor for fried chicken a lot 
of times they'll also have chicken skin so it's  
something it's in our blood okay that's it and I'm 
just going to drain it on some paper towel now the  
reason why I blanch them first or two reasons 
actually 3:1 they've shrunk in quite a bit so  
it's easier to handle to deal with another one 
is it's easier to remove the extra fat so as you  
can see if your chicken has a lot of fat you don't 
want to keep that in right so I'm just gonna pull  
that up and it's really easy to do once they're 
cooked but if it's raw it's like I'll slimy and  
sticky also if you miss and you've got any meat 
on it you want to pull that off as well you don't  
have to be super thorough but you definitely don't 
want like big chunks hanging on to it right there  
you go I know it's not pretty right now but 
trust me it will it will be prettier in just  
a minute so now I'm going to transfer the chicken 
skin onto a couple of layers of fresh paper towel  
and I'm just going to microwave this for three 
minutes that's it and then they'll be nice and  
crispy now the trick is you don't want to do too 
many all at once this weird piece I'm going to  
pull that off I've had success with two pieces 
at a time only if I put three or four it takes  
too long and it doesn't get them crispy the heat 
is too slow and another reason why i blanch it  
is if I don't have I put the skin on raw it'll 
stick to the paper towel quite a bit like this  
it won't stick as much okay I'll season this with 
some salt and pepper but you can season this with  
anything you like you can do garlic powder you 
can do spices you can do chili powder to make  
it spicy some salt and these will shrink a lot so 
don't over salt it two more layers of paper towel  
and this is really just to prevent the fat from 
spattering all over the microwave and that's it
and you can tell it's almost done when the 
spattering slows down and eventually stops  
oh I can smell it it smells like fried chicken 
ooh that's very nice see it's nice and golden  
and you see how it's shrunken a lot it's looking 
like a heart shape and beautiful that's perfect  
actually sometimes I take it out and the corners 
are not very crunchy and you can either stick it  
back but I find I just snip it off with a pair 
of scissors like there's a corner usually the  
corners are really fatty especially for thighs 
I just take this and snip it off like nothing  
happened and there you go okay I'm gonna go and 
microwave my breast and we'll be back in three  
more minutes so disclaimer three minutes is a 
guideline because every microwave is different  
this one I think is a thousand watts and you can 
burn it okay and I'll show you because I just  
did so this one this is a chicken breast and it's 
burned in the middle and that's probably because  
I only put one piece and there's maybe if you 
have one just do two and a half minute and if  
your microwave is a different wattage if it's 
lower you may need to put it in a little more  
but my advice is to listen to it and if it stops 
spattering open it up and take a look okay but  
don't open it too early because you don't want to 
interrupt that initial heat that's what's going to  
cause it to be sort of puff up a little bit and 
become crunchy rather than hard and dense okay  
this one oh look it's like a star I can still eat 
around it but there you go don't do that so this  
was also three minutes right but it was only 
one piece put it in a nice little Bowl so it's  
a little snack for yourself or you can serve 
it like this and people can break it off and  
put it on their salad or whatever it is they're 
eating there we go Oh can you hear that crunch hmm
also good in the words of my brother this is like 
the distillation of all that is good about chicken  
ah very chicken like you know when you have 
a roast chicken or fried chicken this is like  
the best part oh it's so good the only sad thing 
about this recipe is you know you don't have too  
much you always want to have more than what you 
have so if you can get ahold of you know a lot of  
chicken skin from somewhere that would be awesome 
this is so so good I don't even need to dip it in  
anything it's like better than chips oh so good 
so next time you need to buy chicken breasts buy  
bone-in skin-on chicken breast because this right 
here is worth the extra little trouble that it'll  
take you to take the skin off and it's also more 
economical I mean as I said it's a win win and win  
and I hope you give it a try and let me know how 
it goes the recipe I will put it I mean there's  
not much of a recipe but I will put all the 
instructions on hot I can calm and subscribe to  
the show if you haven't done so and I will see you 
next time for your next student is just adventure
I'm going to cover this with two more layers 
ah what are this cult paper towel right
