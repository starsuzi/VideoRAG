Hello, Namaste, Salaam Walaikum, Sat Sri Akal
Welcome back to another session with your vahchef at vahrehvah.com
today I want to show you one of the most
requested chutney on my site lot of
viewers wanted to know how to make a
tomato chutney and tomato chutney
definitely is my favorite
In restaurants we might always serve tomato chutney 
which is really hot
so today we're going to make that chutney
for this preparation
you need a quarter tomatoes just cut
them into small pieces so it cooks
faster
some cummin seeds, mustard seeds curry
leaves, salt some diced green chili
we are going to cook this green chili to i love my tomato chutney really really hot
if you don't have green chili you could use
even red chili whole and fry them
Tamarind you know every chutney needs 
good amount of sourness even though tomatoes
have sourness as we need  little
extra sourness
that's why we're going to add some tamarind
little pieces of ginger garlic in my
chutneys I use large amount of garlic
garlic is a lot of medicinal values you
can go and read on the web and my chutney without garlic is incomplete
I got some cashew nut you don't need to
use cashew nut you can use channa
dal also you can use fried channel dal
if you want to use any other nuts you
can use that coconut powder little bit
hing to prepare this tomato chutney
add some oil in a hot pan some red chilli
see I wanted to even though i'm adding
green chili  red chili has it own very
nice flavor
I love that flavour for my tomato chutney what i do is add a little bit
of whole red chili then i'm going to use a little bit of mustard seeds add
little bit of cumin seeds to this
preparation
I have a little bit of ginger I'm going
to add it and a piece of garlic
this frying of garlic and ginger is my
important stuff to my preparation of
chutney
you know because this garlic gives very
nice flavour and i really love it
then add green chillies
take little bit tamarind you know
just take a lemon size of tamarind for
maybe you know ten Tomatoes
that should be good so what you're going
to do you're going to make this tamarind
we're going to remove all the seeds
ok and then add the tamarind into this oil
other important thing see when the tamarind
fries in the oil it gives very nice flavor. See
cooking is an art because you have to do
this step by step because you want to
get the best flavour of the ingredients
especially when you're eating
chutney add any nuts if you have
ok now i have added cashew nut because you
all know by now that I love Cashew nut
lot of my chutney's lot of other preparations i
make it with cashewnut in India
because the cashew nuts are so expensive lot of
people use  chana dal daliya
fried channa dal in this preparation and
they give an excellent taste and a little bit
different flavors
so here i am using cashew nuts you can go
ahead and use chana dal
little bit of curry leaves and hing, hing is again optional for my chutneys I
love little little bit hing
add lot of tomatoes
okay
and then add some sauce little bit so
dear friends
now you have to cook these Tomatoes
till they are nicely mashed up and then
we're going to make it into a chutney
so you know this is the basic tomato chutney
now let's look into the variation you know
this is our basic tomato chutney we are
going to make little bit variation and ok so
add little bit of mint your
tomatoes and these mint gives a very
nice flavour as a kid whenever my mom
makes this mint chutney
I love to have a chapati along with it and
it tastes excellent and sometimes I just add
little bit ghee on rice and this chutney goes really super we can do another variation
here
by adding coconut okay see cocunut i
add it only when I'm going to eat the
chutney
within the same day or next if I want
to keep this chutney for a week
I don't add coconut but you can ah
what a flavor what a flavor
what I'm going to do I'm going to
add some coconut for this because i'm
going to finish this chutney in the next
two days
now once you add all these ingredients
cover it up and cook it on a slow flame
one of my aunts she makes excellent tomato chutney and when she cooks this Chutney
she cooks cover this mixture for two
hours
she simmers it simmers it and you should taste her chutney Wow !!! out of the
world
so you know you can cook slowly in a
slow heat
you don't want anything to bond and
within the steam let it cook for like 30
minutes then we're going to make a
chutney and taste it just today morning
got this email from this young lady and
her little daughter
mayuri she's just three and she says she
loves to watch my show so i love you
Mayuri keep watching my show and tell your
mom to cook whatever you like on my show
okay okay let me check
Ah oh my god today I'm going to add
some ghee to my rice
wohoo!! now this  all the mixture is cooked
I'm cooking these dishes because of my
cousin Mr. Kamlesh Nakka is in my studio and this guy you know he's going
out of town and I wanted to cook
something before you know he leaves
so I'm going to make some tomato chutney
some mango rice and then we're going to
cook some chicken for him
okay see I do not like to make very
fine paste of this chutney I like it
little bit see like my dinchik dinchik
you know make it a little bit grainy
don't make it really fine paste  make it
little grainy that  gives you to the
grandmother feel of the chutneys
so we're going to add it here
ahh into the blender if you want to
add some water you can go ahead and add
water here and let's make it when I add
salt here and mix it real good
wow awesome
this is just like my mom's chutney this is
how my dad likes it so this is not yet
complete we're going to give a tempering
to this dish to make it a little bit crunchy
with little nuts in it
so we gonna make a tempering I always
love to use the deshi ghee in my
tempering add little bit of red chilli
add some mustard seeds little
bit of cumin seeds and i like to use
lot of urad dal
make sure that Urad dal is slightly
colored if you want to add a little bit of
again hing powder you can do it
ok add curry leaves and then pour it over the chutney. See this last finishing touch
we do gives a very nice flavour and then
especially when you eating fresh you
know that crunchy lenthil gives a very nice taste
this is a superb chutney I suggest you all
try to make this add little mint and little
coconut and it makes it even more
flavorful and tasty
