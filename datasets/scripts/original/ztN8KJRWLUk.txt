hey everyone it's me dama and today i'm
going to be showing you guys how i
decorated this really
simple box and i converted it into this
and i think it turned out really awesome
and cool it's really colorful
fun and it's um i like it because it has
like texture like fabric it i don't know
it's just not like a typical box or it's
just like
flat so i think it turned out really
cool and i really like
um decorating your own like organization
boxes and stuff because sometimes when
you go shopping
to target walmart or um like office
depot
they have like a lot of really cool
boxes but sometimes they might not go
with your um decoration
or whatever so it's gonna sometimes they
clash
so this is a way of actually customizing
it yourself and allowing it to go with
your decoration
so i think it turned out really cool and
it totally goes with my bedroom
so i think it turned out awesome and if
you guys want to see how i did this make
sure to keep watching
so you guys need a couple of things this
is a box that i bought from forever 21
forever 21 from michael's and it's
called a memory box
and i bought it on sell for two dollars
and it looks like so so i'm going to be
opening that
i think it has something inside of the
silica thing
and it's inside is black
now we're actually going to be working
with a top only for right now
and you guys need a piece of fabric this
is a cotton
non-stretchy fabric and a ribbon
a brush could be both sponge or just a
regular brush a bristle brush
some scissors some mod podge
and some i'm not really sure if i'm
going to need the
glue gun but just in case so we're going
to be focusing
on the fabric you need very little
amount
so we're going to be tracing
like so
make sure you place it downwards like so
first tracing it along these sides and
then you're gonna
flip it like so and you're gonna trace
this as well
so just like that and then you're going
to be cutting that out
so it looks like that
now we're going to be putting some mosh
posh right on top of the box
so now you're going to be placing your
fabric right on top
make sure you press on all the sides
i'm also going to be placing some on the
edges so it doesn't continue
fraying
so this is how it looks and now i'm
going to allow it to dry about 10 to 15
minutes
so this is how the top looks and it's
already nice and dry
and i was thinking about adding a ribbon
along the center of
uh of the box but i actually didn't have
any that
looked very good um like in the middle i
just didn't have like the right colors
but you can totally do that if you have
like a ribbon so you can put it like
along the middle
let me show you guys how it looks with
the top
so it looks like that
and um i am going to be adding some
ribbon along the bottom portion
of the top so we can seal like the
end of the fabric
so i'm actually going to be grabbing
this ribbon
right here that i have and it's actually
stretchy
and it's a nice fuchsia color
we're going to be using our hot glue gun
so this is how it looks and i've already
completed finishing and putting the
ribbon on the bottom
and it looks like that like
this other side and you can even
come cover the entire box with fabric if
you'd like
and it looks like that but i like the
contrast between the white and the
colorful
fabric so it looks like that
well i think it turned out really cool
and you can even use these as a gift box
if you'd like
and put like um to and from actually
here
and a nice ribbon around and it could be
like a gift
so it looks really nice so this is how
it turned out and i think it turned out
awesome i love how it turned out and you
can even use it not just like
to put um store stuff in but you can
actually use it as a gift
maybe put um like i said in the video to
and from right here put a nice ribbon
around it
and put the gift inside and it's really
nice
and it's not just like a box that you
bought at a store
you actually took time to actually
decorate it so i think it's
awesome and if you guys happen to try
