hi I'm Sherry and today we're making a
Christmas deco mesh wreath the materials
that you need
are 24 in Pine work
wreath one roll of red deco mesh this
one is 21 in wide by 10 yard
long one roll of green deco mesh this
one is 10 in wide by 10 y
long one roll of decorative ribbon ours
is 2 and 1/2 in wide by 24 ft long three
decorative
piics and a floral
wire well first first begin by
separating the pine so it's easy to see
on your
wreath now take your deco mesh in your
hand turn it under a couple of inches so
you don't have a raw Edge gather it up
and begin by putting it in one of your
Pine twist twist
it extend it out about 12 or 16 in you
don't have to be exact and twist it
again in the next one you can work your
way back and forth all the way around
and then do the top or the bottom
whatever works well for you there's no
right or wrong way to do this so don't
be
afraid continue to do this and work your
way around the whole wreath
[Music]
once you reach the end where you began
cut your deco mesh a little longer than
you need it and fold that end inside
again so you don't have the raw
edges tuck it under and secure it in the
final
Pine twist it now you've added what your
first
color now we're going to add the green
mesh fold it under again the same as we
did with the red begin in any place
you'd like lay it in your Pine and twist
continue to go around your whole wreath
the same way
[Music]
when you get to the end finish it off
the same way you did by cutting it a few
inches extra and turning those extra raw
edges in and tucking it in your last
Pine
now we're ready for the
bow now we'll make the bow to do this
first measure about 24 to 30 in to be
your tail then pinch the middle and make
a loop about 8
in pinch it and make the same size loop
on the other side you don't have to be
exact with this so not to
worry pinch it if it's a one-sided
ribbon you want to be able to twist it
to make sure that that ribbon shows you
can make your Ribbon Loops a little bit
graduating smaller on each time that you
go or you can make them all the same
size whatever you prefer we're going to
make this one graduating a little bit
smaller each time one side Loop another
side Loop pinch it and twist another one
just a little bit
smaller don't worry if it's messy while
you're making your B you'll fluff it up
later pinch and
twist a little bit same size on the
other side pinch and
twist a little bit smaller on that
fourth
one pinch and
twist still a little bit
matching
twist that's your fifth Loop pinch and
twist six
Loop pinch and twist
seventh
eight make one more around the same
size pinch and
twist and we will make our Center
Loop right in the middle for that you
just make one Loop
and hold it in the middle now take your
green floral
wire bend it in half and stick it
through the middle Loop turn your bow
over take the two loose ends and insert
them through the bend pull it
tight separate them twist one back
through the loop again up to the back
and twist that bow twist the bow make
your wire tight lay it down flat and you
can begin to fluff it a
bit we'll do this a bit more once we get
it on a wreath but we're just seeing
that we have made that
boat now you're going to set that
aside pull your wreath back
over find where you want your bow to go
insert your two
wires through an opening to The Back
wire turn your wreath
over taking your
wires and tighten them onto the back of
your
wreath like
so twist it again to secure it if you
have excess wire you can just wind it
around your finger and TI Tu it in turn
your bow back o or your wreath back over
and fluff that
bow arrange it to your
liking and make one of your Tails go
down the right side and one go down the
left side of your
wreath gather a bit of your fa your
fabric of your ribbon and tuck it down
and insert it into one of your
Pine sections to secure it give it a
little bit of a wave fold your Ribbon in
half cutting from the bottom up cut a
Chevron do the same on the other side
another
Chevron tucking that tail into a section
of pine to secure
it you can work with your bow to get it
exactly to your
liking if you have a one-sided bow like
this one is the print you want to make
sure that the
underside is not on the top so it is on
the
underside now we're ready to add our
pcks you want to remove your tags from
your floral
pics separate separate the different
sections out a
bit you want to insert your pics into
the bare
spots secure them with a pine
underneath and then fluff out and
separate the pck so you have opposite
colors on the different parts of the
mesh have fun with it there's no right
or wrong way to do this we're going to
insert one here one here on the
top separating as we go once you hang it
on your door you may even continue to do
that separation a bit just to tweak it
and get it exactly the way you want and
the final one down here at the
bottom the nice thing about the deco
mesh is
it's weatherproof and you can use it
inside or outside
so when you do that make sure your picks
that you're using are appropriate for
where they're going to
go and you've got it done your beautiful
Christmas deco mesh wreath is ready for
hanging either inside or out
