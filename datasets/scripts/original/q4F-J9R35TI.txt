party rentals they've been generous
enough to let us come in and show you
some table settings
we're going to teach you how to set up
an elegant buffet and this is christina
so the first thing you want to do is put
a linen on your table and then attach a
clip
then you want to start your skirting
towards the back of your table
you're going to bring it all the way
around to the front
all the way around to the back
and there you have it this is uh
skirting so you can use this for uh
showers
or for a head table you would use this
type of security
okay so now we're gonna dress the buffet
are you ready christina
okay she put the linen on top and we'll
let her do the rest
so what she's doing here is she's
gathering up the fabric
and then sticking the pin kind of in the
middle
to hold
the pieces together of the fabric
okay and there you have it and this is
uh great for weddings uh or showers

elegant event you might be
having
