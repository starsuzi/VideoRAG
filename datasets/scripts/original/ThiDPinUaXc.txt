okay there's where the line for Superman
is and even though he's not here I would
say Arrowhead for is here in spirit I
saw my little buddy last night and uh he
gave me few of these I brought two to
the park today for Al Michelle and I
thank you Arrowhead we are going to go
skip the line for Superman since they
don't work for Goliath we figured since
the stairs and the flash pass entrance
is right at the bottom this would be you
know maybe not the best r in the park
but that pretzel Loop though I tell you
it's crazy it's awesome and so yeah
we'll be able to skip the line make
short work of this and yeah it's a good
uh good deal we'll be right up front
