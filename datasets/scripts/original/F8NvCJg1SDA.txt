hello and welcome to do it yourself
ideas
in this video i want to show you how i
made the cell phone case for the iphone
5s
so i painted in rainbow colors and
it's really cute and i made it on the
loom board
i used 11 pins and wore 33 rows
so it perfectly fits the iphone
[Music]
and i'll show you how exactly i made it
so again i did it in rainbow colors with
pink and two
so yeah i started with pink and up there
i did with white and black
so i think it's a really nice contrast
and finishes off nicely
so yeah i hope you like this tutorial in
this video
you'll approximately need 800 elastics
for this
so for the phone case of the iphone
i take the board
so that the openings are directed
towards me on the left side
and on the right side they should be
pointing
away from me
[Music]
so i took away the middle part and the
blue part as well
[Music]
so i start with pink elastics
since i want to do a rainbow and i start
on the left side and pull it on
diagonally to the next pin
i cross it over in the middle so it
should make an x
[Music]
the same thing on the next pin i always
take the elastic double over
so i do this for 11 pins
[Music]
[Music]
so i've got six now
that's the seventh
[Music]
eighth
[Music]
nine
ten
[Music]
so i'm at the 11th
[Music]
now i do the same thing on the other
side
[Music]
again i pull it on diagonally making an
x
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
and the last one for this side
[Music]
there i now have 11 pins on both sides
so this is what it should look like
always diagonally so that we have big
axes now
now the second round
but before i push everything down a bit
so i can work easier
[Music]
i start on the left side
and pull one elastic over two pins
i did this for the whole row
so there should always be two elastics
on one pin
[Music]
so 10 elastics all in all
so
then from one side to the other
and then back down the row again
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so this is what it looks like right now
[Music]
so now i can start looming the pink
elastics
so i take the pink elastics with my
crochet hook pull them over the pin and
let them fall in the middle
i do this for the whole row
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's one side finished
so i turn it around and do the same
thing on the other side
again i take the pink elastics pull them
over the pin and let them fall in the
middle
[Music]
do
[Music]
so this is what it looks like
now i push everything down again
[Music]
and then i can start with yellow
it's exactly the same thing as before
afterwards i'll do pink orange
[Music]
so each row will be pulled on like that
so after yellow we have green blue
purple and then pink again
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and now i loom the orange again
exactly like before just pull them over
the pin and let them fall
in the middle
[Music]
[Music]
this might take a while so maybe listen
to a movie or watch a movie
or listen to music while you're doing
this
[Music]
so push everything down again
[Music]
and we can go on with green
again start on the left corner
[Music]
[Music]
afterwards we'll loom the yellow over
the green
and then the colors just go on and on
so do this for approximately 30 rows
[Music]
for the iphone i do 33 rows and then
i'll show you how to do the end
there this is what it looks after 30
rows
so i did five runs of the rainbow
[Music]
and now i'll
do white
for the finish
[Music]
i stamp down i start down here with
the white
and then i just continue to the top
[Music]
for most phones you'll need
approximately 30 rows
sometimes a bit more it really depends
on your phone
so i used approximately
750 to 800 elastics but again it really
depends on your phone
but this phone case is very flexible so
don't worry about it
[Music]
it's also nice to have a few elastics
and reserve in case some of the break
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
push it all down again
i do this two more times with wipes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you need to pay extra attention here
while you're looming because it's the
same color so it won't be distinguished
as easily
but
it should work
[Music]
[Music]
so i push everything down again
and i do another row in white
so it's a third one
[Music]
afterwards i'll do a row in black
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
then i loom again
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
push it all down again
so that was the last white row
and now comes black
[Music]
so i have 33 rows in total
[Music]
so this is what it looks like right now
and now i can loom the white over the
black
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so we only have the black elastics on
the pins left
so i pushed everything down one last
time
and now i can take the first pin
and i take the elastics with my hook and
lay them over the next pin
[Music]
now i go into the pin
go get the bottom elastics
and pull them over the next pin
and i continue doing this for the whole
row
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
at the end of the row it's the exact
same thing just pull it over to the
other side
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so here we have the last one
and we just pulled over so to the second
pin
so it should look something like this
so here we have the first pin
so i take another elastic
and
to close it all off i pull it through
and then i pull the elastic through
itself so that it closes off nicely
pull it tightly so that it doesn't open
by accident
and then you can just take everything
off the board
[Music]
so yeah pull on it a bit so that it gets
into a nice form and shape
and then you can put your phone into it
so as you can see it's really the
perfect shape and
size
[Music]
