ingredients we need we've just got flour
I like using non blanch unbleached
almond milk baking powder we got some
sugar we got some vegan butter we got
some salt some good old organic bananas
and I'm actually going to Chuck some
blueberries in there
today okay so I am going to start by
mashing one of my bananas I'm going to
start with just one and based off the
texture of the batter I might Mash
another basically this banana is acting
as an egg replacement if you don't like
bananas because you're an Abomination or
that would be my sister or if you're
allergic you don't have to use banana
you can just mix a bit of corn starch
and water wait till it's all tacky and
then use
that but oh banana so I'm going to use
banana I'm going to
mash it's best if they're really
ripe stop sneezing stop sorry
all right so we've got one mashed banana
in there next I'm going to
add one and 1/4 cups of almond
milk damn
it we are going to go 3 and 1/2
teaspoons of baking
powder two
stop making noise over
there go one teaspoon of
salt
waa okay you're going to go one
tablespoon of
sugar and now we need 3 tablespoon of
our vegan butter melted I should have
done this first

melted butter we're just going to put
that in
here mix it
in I haven't put in the flour yet but
