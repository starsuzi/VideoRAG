have you ever needed to laminate a
business card or a name tag and you just
did not have the laminating machine you
didn't want to spend the money for just
one or two well I'm going to have to
laminate this name tag here and I'd like
to show you an easy way to do it now
place your card centered inside the
laminating sheets right there in the
middle making sure that there is enough
sheet on all four sides there is one
side that is already sealed for you and
you want to make sure that is facing
towards you because it's key that you
start on that side now I just have here
a white sheet of paper on top of a solid
clipboard old clipboard here you need a
hard surface it can be a table whatever
you want to use just use make sure you
have a white sheet of paper not
lined then you take another white sheet
of paper stick on top of it get yourself
just a basic iron nothing fancy have it
on a low to medium setting starting on
the corner that is
sealed slowly start working it towards
the other side
and you can do that couple times usually
it takes two to three
passes we will check that
now very close is a couple pieces that
need to be heated just a little bit more
so we going do it one more
time
and there we go and that is how to
laminate A card without a
machine
