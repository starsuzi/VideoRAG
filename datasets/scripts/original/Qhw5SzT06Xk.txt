hey everybody welcome to the happy hour
have the bee
i am heather b of course and today you
are in for a treat i am remixing
an old classic drink the drink is called
a moscow mule which is usually made with
like vodka
and lime and mint and i just decided to
flip it all up and do something really
special for you guys
i got the copper cup and i was blessed
enough to find a nice copper shaker look
how pretty that is
and i'll show you how to do it it takes
no time you're going to love the flavors
you know get you some ice in this shaker
all right put it right in there
and as i said i'm just flipping the
classic instead of regular vodka i'm
using pineapple vodka
which is so good i love the pineapple it
tastes so good and it tastes so fresh
and i'm actually making a pineapple
ginger moscow mule so
i found the ginger brandy which is
excellent a ginger flavored brandy
you're just going to add a little bit
you don't want it to be overpowering
you're going to take that lime juice and
add it right inside of there as well
all right get you some fresh pineapple
and that's what we're substituting for
instead of the fresh lime wedges we're
going to get that right in there
and also this is sprig a fresh mint
get that right on top and i can smell
the flavors already
and just get to shaking it i promise you
as soon as you start shaking it
all the flavors you can smell them
already just coming through
your shaker and you know it's going to
be good all right
shake is nice and cold you see the frost
that's when you know it's ready
man it smells good pour that right
inside
that cup and rather than top it off with
regular ginger beer i found a pineapple
ginger beer how good does that sound
you're going to twist that right off
nice and cold
and pour that right on top
and for you all you pineapple lovers
like me if you want to just go ahead
and just add another piece of pineapple
in and maybe another piece of mint to
get that refreshing flavor
you have it right here a pineapple
ginger beer
moscow meal try it at home it is so good
you
