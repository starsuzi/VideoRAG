hey guys the portrait dart here remember
a while back i made an faq video
regarding the drawing tools that i use
more specifically in there i talked
about my self-made blending tool
basically the typical store-bought ones
have you know some issues and
limitations they are generally too hard
and not great at blending mid to large
areas
if you haven't seen my faq video yet i
highly encourage you to check it out by
the link on the screen or in the
description first okay so in this video
i'm going to show you how to make my
type of blending stump
and then perhaps hopefully within the
next video or two
i'll do a short
real-time join demonstration using the
blending tool that we made in this video
i'm sure there are many ways to make
your your own blending stump this is the
way that i do it and it is what i use in
pretty much all my art videos to create
the blending effect that you guys seem
to enjoy
all right let's get started
there are really only three things you
need for this so it's pretty simple one
tape two scissors
and third one
which is gonna be really hard to come by
is going to be newspaper or newsprint
paper
which is really the same thing i myself
prefer newsprint paper
because
just because it looks neater you know
first step is just to really cut a strip
of paper a long strip of paper
the dimension of the strip is going to
going to determine the final outcome
uh how basically how long or how thick
the blending stump is going to be for
the sake of this demonstration i'm going
to cut it oh yeah and one end of the
strip should be much wider than the
other end so for the sake of this
demonstration i want to make it one end
maybe like two three inches and the
other end
about one inch
and you just fold it like this and then
cut along the fold of the line
and
and you should end up with something
that looks like this a strip of paper uh
with one end that's longer than the
other that's wider than the other
technically okay so now comes the most
important part
rolling the paper uh you want to start
from the the wider end and you want to
start it as solid as you can because
this part here is going to form the core
and the center of the blending stump
so it's pretty important that you start
out very finely and try to roll it as
tight and as solid as you can the
direction of the rolling is obviously up
and you're trying to follow the center
of the strip of paper as closely as you
can
you can see how straight or how well
you're doing by uh you know the both
sides should start
showing this um protruding like dome
shape as you're rolling
and once you get to the end just taped
off the center with a piece of tape and
you are done
this is much softer and makes blending
much easier and characteristic of this
blending stump is that at any time you
can change its shape by just pulling on
you know one end or poke the other end
with like a sharp stick or something uh
as you can see you can just make you can
make one side much longer depends on
what you want and which one would you
need you can just you know play around
and see what works for you i mean you
cannot really screw this up as long as
you start with a very tight and solid
center core as you roll in the paper it
doesn't matter if you didn't roll it
perfectly straight up you'll still most
likely end up with something that you
can use and um
here are the few that i've made in the
past
and as you can see some of them are some
of these are not double-ended
just the way you roll the paper and some
like this guy here i've been using for a
while it's kind of worn out
and the good thing about this type of
paper stump is that it is very flexible
in shape as you can see i can just like
play around with it and just kind of
transforms to i can make it sharper i
can make one side more rounded and
another good thing about these ones
these softer ones are that the longer
you use them the softer they become and
the fuzzier they become
they actually become better at their job
at planning
and lastly i want to make a point is
that
with blending stumps
is of course they're great at blending
you know charcoal that's the whole point
there are also just don't forget they're
also a tool for drawing on their own
especially if you have like a dirty
blending stump that you've been using
for a while you can actually just
directly use it to
put tones down and just draw on the
paper and often that's it actually the
result is the most smooth texture
so keep that in mind and if you want to
do really finely detailed blending i
still recommend the ones you buy from
the store like the small hard ones
um
like if you want to blend blend and
eyelash or something like that and now
i'm going to do a relatively speaking
short real-time demonstration using one
of these self-made blenders
i'll probably just draw like a small
part of portrait or something with a bit
of light commentary focusing mostly on
the blending aspect
it's going to be a separate video and
once available you can find the link on
the screen or in the description so i
hope you guys benefited from this video
thanks again for watching and oh and of
course subscribe and all that if you
haven't
and cheers
