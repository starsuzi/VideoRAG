How to Use a Mandoline Slicer.
Mandoline slicers are great tools for making
evenly thin slices of fruits and vegetables.
You will need A mandoline slicer and a potato.
Step 1.
Place the slicer perpendicular to you so that
youâ€™ll have better control over the food.
Mandoline blades are very sharp.
Use a safety guard and take precautions when
using and cleaning a mandoline slicer.
Step 2.
Try the mandoline with a potato.
Cut it in half to make a flat surface.
Step 3.
Attach the rounded end of one potato half
to the hand pusher.
Step 4.
Slide the flat side of the potato across the
blades using even strokes and consistent pressure.
Adjust the thickness of each cut with the
knob or lever on the side of the slicer.
Step 5.
Use the same process for the other half of
the potato, using the hand pusher to make
even and consistent pressure strokes.
Step 6.
Clean the slicer immediately after use to
prevent food from drying on the parts.
Try it next with a variety of vegetables!

book, published in 1570, shows a board with
