last week I got this request but I
promised I will do this before Christmas
but um I got the tree color and I
thought why should I wait a long time
and I'm going to do the uh request for S
Lankan coconut cake without any fruits
but I'm going to use cashews this is
optional if you don't want to add
any so let's do the coconut cake so
these are the ingredients for the
coconut cake 250 g rice flour roasted I
already roasted uh and this is how it
looks like and 100 G roasted uh semolina
750 ml coconut trickle or even you can
use the kitul P Trickle and 250 g
desicated coconut if you are using fresh
coconut you need to use about 500 G and
um vanilla few drops and few drops of
Rose um water or Rose Essence and six
egg yolks and six egg
whites 1 cup 250 ml very thick coconut
milk and 1 and 1/2 teaspoon baking
powder 250 g cashew nuts and if you um
like to add these spices you can add if
not you can add all spice instead I'm
using cinnamon cardamoms and cloves and
um Fel seeds so take about half a
teaspoon from each and grind this in a
grinder and use about a teaspoon of the
powder so let's start first of all into
a pot add the desiccated coconut or the
fresh coconut and into that add the
coconut
milk if you're using fresh coconut you
can use uh water
instead add the
trickle into that add a pinch of salt
now I know I will get a question
asking if can't find the trickle what
can I use you can use brown sugar you
had to make the syrup out from brown
sugar 750 ml and can use but I had to
say The Taste is different
so put this on the stove cook it until
it absorb the Trickle and leave it to
cool
down now into a clean mixing bowl add
the egg
whites and start whisking it until it
comes to a soft pink
Peak once it is ready take it out when
it is ready it has to hold the egg
whites on the beaters so this is how it
looks like so I'm going to take this
out now in a separate mixing
bowl mix the egg
yolks using your padle attachment and
into that add few drops of vanilla
and a few drops of Rose
Essence make sure to test the rose
Essence the how strong it is before you
add it then the grounded um
spices mix it well about 1
minute now it's ready so into that going
to add the same semolina the roasted
semolina and the roasted um rice flour
I'm using the red rice flour but you can
use the white one but this will give a
bit more darker color to this and add
the cashew
nuts and mix it
well so now into that add 1 and 1/2
teaspoon baking
powder and I want to show you this that
the honey and the sorry Trickle and the
coconut mix this is how it looks like
don't make it very hard because I just
boiled it and switch off the stove it
has to be a bit runny because the there
is no uh other liquid in the rice flour
mix now into the mixed rice flour mix
add the cooked
coconut and mix it
well
now it's the time to taste your mix and
see whether um the sugar is enough if
not if you like more sweet cakes you can
add more
sugar now I'm going to mix the egg
whites into the cake mix
slowly I'm going to fold it
over at this point you need to preheat
your oven to UH 60
cus and
then I'm using this 12x 4 in cake pan
don't make it very high one reason is it
will take longer to cook and the other
reason is that this is a very rich cake
so you need to um cut into smaller
pieces and pour the mix into the baking
tray I'm going to bake this on
160 about 1 hour to 1 and 1/2
hours I left some cashews um separate
and I'm going to put it on
top hope it is it will stay like
this so the coconut cake is ready to cut
now I left it um like 2 hours outside
and if I cut to show you how it looks
like you know the thing is when you um
bake a cake you if you keep it for at
least 2 3 days outside before consuming
it tastes better and nicer and look it's
really soft and moist and
um this goes really well with a nice cup
of coffee or on the New Year table and
try this and leave me a comment hope you
will enjoy this thank you for watching
