How to Fix Squeaky Bike Brakes.
An idyllic bike ride can quickly be ruined
by squeaky bike brakes.
Hereâ€™s a checklist of common squeaky brake
culprits and how to fix them.
You will need Clean rags An oil-free cleaner
An Allen or socket wrench A piece of cardboard
and new pads.
Step 1.
Clean the brake pads and rims with a clean
rag dampened with an oil-free cleaner, such
as rubbing alcohol, to remove debris.
You may need to remove the wheel for access.
Bike brakes may be cantilever, side-pull,
or disk.
Determine which type of brakes you have to
learn how to best maintain them.
Step 2.
Check the alignment of your brake pads.
The brake pads should make contact only with
the rim, not the tire, and the pads should
not be able to slip under the rim.
Step 3.
Adjust the brakes with a toe-in.
Loosen the pads with an Allen or socket wrench
and use a piece of cardboard to create a half-millimeter
gap at the back of the pad.
This angles the front of the brake pad to
ensure that it hits the rim first.
Bike brake pads may be cartridge pads that
easily slip out, or bolt-on pads that require
loosening a bolt, spacers, and washers.
Step 4.
Consider replacing the pads if nothing seems
to eliminate the squeaking.
Buy the appropriate cantilever, pull, or disk
brake pad.
Step 5.
Remove the bolt or pin holding the old pad
in place and install the new pads.
Align the new pads with the rim with a toe-in.
