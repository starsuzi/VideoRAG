hey guys it's bun 3 here and today I
just wanted to do another tutorial on
Rainbow Loom instead of the single one
which I showed you guys last
time
and okay and so that's what they look
like um and today I'm going to be
showing you how to do the fish tail ones
which look
like
that so now I'm going to show you how
it's done let's get
started okay so this one is very similar
to the single stitch bracelet and I
recommend if you don't know how to do
the single stitch bracelet I recommend
not trying this until you do know how
but it's really easy
and fairly confident you guys will know
how to do it pretty
soon so anyway to start
you're just going to want to take a one
of your colors and put it over the nails
like that and make the little eight
formation that we made in
um and the single stitch and I actually
decided I am doing a pattern for this my
pattern is pink yellow
purple so put them all three on on um
and if you're doing a pattern you're
going to want to put your first color
your second color and your third color
if you have
one and
then just take your toothpick or
whatever and put it under and
over and then do the same thing with the
other side over and
under like
so and then pull it down a little
bit like
this and put it
down and then take your other one and do
the same exact
thing and keep going like this until you
get until till it looks like
this so this took me
like 20 to 30 minutes
maybe um because this one's a little bit
harder than um any of than these
ones but um it's okay and you can
stretch it out pretty far without it
breaking and I actually really like the
color pattern I used for
this um so now once you're done I just
just test it out to make sure it's going
to fit you and this one might be a
little bit big but if it is I'm just
going to show you how to smaller it so
now this will be the part where you
attach the SE clip but as you guys know
I don't have any SE Clips so we're going
to do my string
method and if you never
watched
the
um single stitch video you want to know
how to do it let me show you how to so
just stick your toothpick or crochet
hook right through the
middle and then take it
off and so it looks like
this and now you don't
need the pink one you just need the
yellow one o
but you need to get it into here
first the test is coming you know you
know Sabrina you're always busy these
days it's like you don't have time to be
my
and then stick it down like
that like
that so there it
is and it's about this song so far
and just take your
string which I have
pre-cut and I like to stretch it out
with my fing
fingers and tie it like
so like this that bad are you kidding
I've been there what I didn't stud
either don't B fing to Canada like
this
a and then
tie tie it like
that and I'm just going to put a chip on
mine I'm just a number to you aren't
i213 41181
9577 okay so I'm L numbers to
you and just tie
it and spend the money no yes I'm going
to buy a lab a puppy a dog no a
laboratory and just
TI
that now cut off the
extra then bam you're
done all right well anyway thanks for
watching bye
