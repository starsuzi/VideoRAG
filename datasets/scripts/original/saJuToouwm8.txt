you
hi I'm Greg in this video I'm going to
show you how to clean a dirty headlight
lens with shaving cream and our razor so
let's get to work
check it out how dirty that is smear it
on like that get a nice coat going
you don't have to worry about it getting
on the paint just shaving creams all it
is okay so you just take your razor and
one by one just like you're shaving
will you look at that that's looking
better already razors doing a great job
be sure to watch this video all the way
to the end so you get exactly how this
all worked and now I'll just buff that
out with my buffing rag now will you
look at that a fine job with shaving
cream and a razor but wait there's more
so now I don't actually try that at home
because that was just a little joke the
real way that this gets done is through
some polishing compound applied onto the
headlight lens and after you apply that
you simply rub that rubbing compound
into the headlight lens and sometimes
you have to be pretty aggressive with
the polishing compound
and that removes the oxidation then the
final polish is with a clean rag and
then if you want to put a layer of car
wax on that that works really really
well
so really it's any kind of polishing
compound and a little bit of elbow
grease and a clean rag and you can see
the difference between that headlight
lens and the other
so I'm great your kind oh thanks for
watching this video but for other very
serious videos on how to keep your car
highly maintained go to your car angel
calm I'll see you in the next video
take care
you
