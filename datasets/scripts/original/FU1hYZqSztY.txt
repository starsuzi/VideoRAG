If you're dealing with a very soft felted
hat you may want to try the old family lint
roll. Now, it's not quite effective in removing
the dust, as you'll see. It does get most
of it off, but it takes a little more work,
a little more patience, and a little more
time. However, it has far less impact on the
matte of the felt. And, again, as we're working
over years and years with our hats, that's
kind of a crucial thing. The third and final
way you can service a hat at home, and fairly
easily, is to take a sponge or a lint free
cloth, dip it in just a little bit of water,
and very gently brush it across the hat and
brush it off. And you'll see it's making a
clean spot there. This is not the easiest
way to clean a hat but it probably the one
most portable. And the reason I say it's the
most portable, is that if you find yourself
out of town, you're in a hotel, almost anywhere
you can get a lint free cloth, a linen cloth
or a sponge, is absolutely ideal to take the
dust off of your hat and get it looking good
for that night out on the town.
