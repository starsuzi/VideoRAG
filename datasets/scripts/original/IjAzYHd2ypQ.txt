I'm sure there's a way you can do this
for cheaper if you scrunched up the
parts but I bought them all brand
new and uh this is the
list uh it was 21 bucks for four
pulley 17 bucks for four ratchet straps
I'm only going to use
two those screw eyes was five 448 for
four of
those screw eyes S hooks four of those
372 the Rope was 12 bucks for 100t of
one4
inch and then the
two swivel snap
swivels or 566 and then the
cleat was $189 so this is the
setup got these pulleys they at 125
these are at 75
my fish house I'm guessing is about 60
lb so that's Overkill snap swivels this
is where I'm going to latch the ratchets
in snap swivels this is where I'm going
to put the ratchets hooks in there and
then put them around
my Ice House snap hook rated at0 es hook
rated at
125 the ropes weighted rated at 100 lb
so that's what I want to do I want to
tie the rope there go through there up
there down there around there up through
there and then to the cleat on that wall
somewhere going to put the fish house
right up
there
so that's the way I'm going to set it up
I ended up with one extra s hook cuz I
sold them in two packs
so all in all I
spent
$71 yep it's amazing isn't it 40 45
48 60
62
67
tax but I do think this will last a very
long time and and I love pulley anyway
so and the extra two ratchet straps
camel camel ratchet
straps I mean come on that's cool all
right
out if this works I'll try to give you
an idea of how I've been doing this I
started the first eye on the first
stud these are all in
studs at 38 in
so I've just been going 38 in all the
way down just taking
the tape
here do it better this
way I find 38
in and then I
just make a mark
punch it in the
sheetrock give it a few turns get it
through the
sheetrock take a real hammer
once it gets in the stud it's pretty
hard so I get this ready bar
TR
what
I did add a shety valve just in case I
put a big
old big old bolt in there if you can see
that it's about 6 in
long um and a
couple hit
knots just in
case
oh yeah
