bracket chains okay want the run through
a few things I take to work um which is
anytime you eat after after need to
clean really um this will prevent the G
from overgo Over the teeth or ruining
your teeth in the process so I'm using a
pencil case which is the best advice for
carrying everything including a long
toothbrush so if I just run through what
I have um
these these you just literally break
through they um done by wisdom and they
look like these and you clean in between
your teeth like so and they're great for
gaps cuz apparently not supposed to use
floss well that's what I got to hold
anyway this sine um rela which is rapid
relief which is like a pain relief but
it's it does work slightly and it gives
you mild um more relief from it so I
think that's that's been quite a useful
thing to have to keep building up
child's toothbrush and not my own
personal choice but it is soft on the
other side and it's children friendly
and plus the brist are really soft and
level so it's easier to
control especially if you're in slight
pain at the time Dental wax um always
recommended um and if you have something
what I've got is is chain mouth and then
you want to use one of these just to
check the process of it and see if it's
all okay and dark in your
mouth um so that's what I tend to
use um or I do T try to do it after
everything after eating every time um
and be aware that when you have wax when
you're eating and then obviously you're
brushing your teeth that generally falls
out and you have to keep replacing it so
it's good idea to get quite a few of
these just build up this been the first
week at the moment uh the pain is
bearable um but it it does get a bit
hard when you if you get an El because
you're not using the wax properly so if
I give you an example for the
wax so I'm just going to open it
up now it looks like this like I have
shown previously um and what you do is
just rip off a bit now you do have to
warm it up in your hands I've noticed
just because it I find it a lot easier
to control so generally I just wrap it
around the circle right into a size size
bow now I would normally do it slightly
bigger than that you just place it onto
your brackets which is like
that by
