so today the temperature is supposed to
get up to 120 and I brought a cookie
sheet and we are going to put them in
the dashboard of my car and cook up some
cookies cuz they say it's possible so
we're going to do
it here's
something no
M dashboard cookies we're parked next to
Jen don't tell her goodbye cookies see
you in a few hours and here we are today
with Aaron saffle Aaron saffle and she
has devices that will tell us the exact
temperature of inside the car
172° 172 inside of my car so here we are
about 45 50 minutes into it and the
butter is leaving each cookie and
burrowing up into the corner we didn't
want to have to go into the car but we
don't want that butter on his
car it's the Deathly Hollows in
here that's so cool so we're going to
pick up the cookies we found out that
the temperature has to be above
130° in order to kill salmonella and you
have to cook that for an hour we're here
we're done we're going to test the
temperature it's
181 so so the cookies are
safe they look all right let's go try
them
out one thing we noticed is they didn't
really expand maybe cooking them at a
lower temperature didn't allow it to
rise oh there's still a little doughy on
the inside but here we
go apparently they're perfect they taste
all right did you need the
PO um we
are is
it aome I highly recommend doing this if
you have 3 hours to kill and your car is
going to be in the hot sun for the
afternoon do it it was pretty
awesome
