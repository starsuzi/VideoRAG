hey y'all it's Jody here with a quick
tip on how to get the most out of your
produce people are telling me all the
time that organic is so expensive and I
can't afford it and yada yada yada and
then you go into the store and you're
buying this by the pound and you figure
I'm not going to use all that stem
what's a girl to do with all that stem
so let me show you a way you can eat it
what's we're going to cut the top off
first and then we're going to cut the
edge off here on the
bottom you can see if I get it up close
here there's like a little Ridge around
the inside there ins you want to remove
from that part out the inside is tender
so the easiest way to do that is to
literally
just cut
down the side of the broccoli you can go
from one end or the
other and you just cut the outside
off getting down to the tender part or
you can lay it on the
side and cut it off whichever way you
feel more
comfortable doing it some of us have
better knife skills and I am finding out
clearly here that my knife needs a
sharpen just keep trimming it down I'm
going to switch to a smaller blade so I
can have a little bit more control over
this stuff and inside it is really super
tender so what I do is after I get it
all trimmed
down o I do need to sharpen my blades
and get this piffy part
off then what I will do I'm going to
throw that all in the
sink literally take it and just cut it
like
this into
discs and then we have some great little
broccoli pieces you can stir fry them
you can uh blanch them and then throw
them in your salad they taste just like
broccoli a great way to save money while
you're trying to capitalize on all your
organic expenditures
