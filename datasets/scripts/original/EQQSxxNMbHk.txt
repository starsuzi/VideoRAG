today we're going to make a pipe out of
a soda
can so what you're going to need is just
a ordinary soda can it doesn't matter
what kind it is and you're going to take
off the cap which I already did you're
going to go to the side where you where
you drink from and you have to make sure
that's at the top of the bottle and
you're going to indent right where that
is and make like
um make like a barrier so the substance
can't get
out
and
then you're going to take your
cap and bend
it back and forth until you have two
pieces and when you have two the two
pieces you can
pop holes into your
can or you could use a thumb tack or any
other sharp
object so when you have
the when you have the top part ripped
ripped up you are going to pop like a
couple of holes in the top where you
made the
intents
and yeah
so when you're done with
that
you are going
to it's going to look like
this
so there you go you put your substance
on the top and that's it
