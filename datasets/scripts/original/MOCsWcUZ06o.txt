hey guys thanks for joining me today
today we're going to make a pans seared
steak with
butter with some
thyme
Rosemary
shallots and then we're going to have
the mushroom as a side to it I'm also
going to saut the mushrooms with some
regular brown onions and have those as a
side um and because the steak is pretty
big so I'm not going to do any other
sides with it today so this is all
you're going to need I'm also going to
use some parsley flakes for my topping
which will be the shallots parsley and
butter for the steak we're going to
start in the pan with a little bit of
olive oil and I have a olive oil that is
infused in um Rosemary so it's really
nice I really like this one use whatever
one you have though and then we're also
going to put the butter in there so that
we could get the steaks going at a high
temperature I like my medium about
medium rare for a
ribeye so it won't take very long for my
steak to be done uh my husband however
he likes his cook through more so uh
we'll do it at a high heat and then I'm
going to lower it just a little bit just
to get it cooked through a little more
and then we'll be all set for dinner so
I'm so glad you could join us let's
start and
pepper
and I'm just going to push it in there
just to make sure it sticks to the
meat more than my pan and I'm just going
to do the other side as
well all right guys I went ahead let me
shut this off real quick I went ahead
and put are steak into the butter and
the olive oil I also put a couple of
sprags of the Rosemary and the thyme in
here okay it's starting to Brown looking
for a little more of a crusty Brown on
that bottom so I'm going to go ahead and
let it keep
going just brushing it to get all those
lovely
spices into the flavor of our meat
and remember everything that's going to
be left here is going to be turned into
our our sauce
basically all right it's looking
good
there we
go it is sizzling up in
here
[Music]
okay that feels like about where I want
my steak so I'm going to pull this one
out
and I'm going to start with the other
one I'm going to add a little more olive
oil for the next
one
some
butter Rosemary and
time and our gorgeous
[Music]
steak
[Music]
I'm getting those sides to make sure
they're
also browned
[Music]
evenly
beautiful
[Music]
[Music]
and the reason why I got popped right
there guys the reason why I put a little
more butter and olive oil is because
when I make my mushrooms I want them
done in the same butter and olive
oil um because there's so much flavor in
there so everything's going to kind of
carry the flavor throughout the
meal and that's just what I'm looking
for if it's not what you guys want
definitely do it your way I'm no
expert I just cook dinner for my family
and I enjoy it
and I thought I'd share it with you
guys if there's something you guys would
like to see me cook give me a comment
below let me know I'd love to try new
stuff I'd love to try all kinds of
[Music]

suggestions I appreciate and would
love

medium well I'm going to go ahead and
pull it out and Co
it it's got that nice brown crispy
coating on that
outside smells so good in here
now I'm going to go ahead and get our
shallots some
butter and we're going to smother these
steaks all
right put a pat of butter into my
pan
I got my garlic I'm
putting about two
teaspoons
and I don't want my garlic to burn so
I'm going to grab my
shallots
and I have a little garlic and parsley
salt I'm going to put a tiny bit of that
in
there you
making that was my son
asking the typical kid
question he said what are you making he
doesn't eat
steak so he's getting a hamburger for
dinner not the
steak so that's what for
dinner so I'm just going to cook those
until my shallots become translucent and
then I'm going to go ahead and add the
parsley flakes and then it's going to be
ready it looks like I need a little more
in there so I'm actually going to add a
little more of that olive oil to
it not a whole lot about that
much and we'll let those go just for a
little bit we'll be right
back I'm going to add some of the
parsley
flakes that's good nice good helping
