hello and welcome back to beautiful
Boulder Ridge I'm Trevor and I'm going
to show you how to make our world famous
chocolate martini
today to start we're going to take our
martini glass and get it nice and chill
put it off to the side and let that
chill while you make your drink to start
the
drink fill the Shaker full with ice and
we're going to start with the smaroff
vanilla vodka we're going to do two
parts of this
and we're going to move on to drono
amoretto any Amoro would do this is our
personal
favorite we're just going to add a half
part of the
derer now to finish the drink we're
going to go with the gadiva dark and
white chocolate laor it's going to
essentially
be a combination of two parts
all
right now put the top on the Shaker get
a nice
seal and give it a good
Shake set that off to the side for now
but before we can pour it we have to
make the glass look real fancy going to
take a little bit of her's chocolate
syrup and get a nice nice little design
in there we'll take our
strainer pour and there it is the world
famous Boulder Ridge chocolate
