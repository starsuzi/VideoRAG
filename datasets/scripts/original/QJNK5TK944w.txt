hi this is Bonnie with TLC Inspirations
and today we're going to do uh applique
uh with embroidery on the sewing machine
with our hoop and so you're going to
need your base fabric your um applique
Fabric and a stabilizer of your choice
um it can either be self adhesive or
lightweight uh I'm going to use a
temporary spray adhesive with a tear
away stabilizer for this
tutorial so I'm going to lightly spray
my the back of my applique fabric with
the adhesive and um adhere my stabilizer
to the back
side just like that and then we're going
to hoop it
and um we're going to secure our hoop
and then we're going to take it over to
our machine um but first we have to have
a design file now for an applique you're
going to get two files with your design
one will be a DL file or diine file
which is just an outline and the other
will be your embroider file so with our
applique piece of fabric um we're going
to choose use the applique
file and we're going to set our machine
uh I want to downsize this design a
little bit so I'm going to take it down
to like
3.64 again this is the embroidery design
on the uh applique
Fabric and there you can see it's on my
screen so now we're going to stitch it
out
again um while this is stitching out
I'll just mention that uh you can choose
your um stabilizer according to what
your project is um if you're doing it on
a fine fabric you may want a stiffer
stabilizer if you're going to have it
against your skin such as a t-shirt
you're going to want to go for a
soft
stabilizer on the
back so make it according to your
project
okay now this is the first part of the
stitching now in this particular design
my machine is going to stop and uh allow
me to change colors if I want to but for
this tutorial I'm going to stick with
the uh original color so I'm just going
to hit the start button again and uh let
it finish stitching
out this is a very basic
design um you get more intricate designs
there's going to be more steps and
changing your colors and
whatnot okay now it stopped again and I
still don't want to change color so I'm
just going to hit the start button again
on my machine let it finish stitching
out so now we've got the design
completely stitched out and we're going
to remove it from our hoop
and we've got our base fabric um in this
case this is going to probably be a a
quilt square or a pocket on something um
something very basic now you're going to
want to cut out the embroidery design as
close as you can to the design without
cutting your threads uh because if you
get into your design and cut your
threads obviously it's going to unravel
on you and that wouldn't be good and
when I cut them out I choose to leave my
stabilizer on the back because it it's
just easier to cut it isn't
flimsy Okay so we've cut out our design
and we've got our um base fabric hooped
now there's our design cut out and it's
going to go in the middle of this
Square so we've got that hooped with our
stabilizer again on the back side and we
go in this time and we're going to
choose the diine file which is just an
outline file and loaded into our machine
and you're also going to have to go in
and resize it to match your original
design which was 3.64 so this one will
go down to like
3.65 which will give us a outline of
where we're going to put our heart
okay we're ready to go and we're going
to stitch out the the dialine file
now or outline file or whatever you want
to call it it's a DL file when you get
your applique
design okay you can see it's stitched
out and ready for us to place our
applique don't remove it from the
hoop so we're going to leave this in the
hoop we're going to grab our cutout
applique and Center
it and to keep it in place we're going
to again grab our temporary adhesive
unless you have a self adhesive uh on
the
back I'm going to spray the back of it
and we're going to glue it into
place and then we're going to go back to
our machine and this time you're going
to go back to your original
applique
file and you're going to let the machine
Stitch the first two or three segments
the first one is usually a tack down
Stitch and the second one will be an
applique Stitch and then sometimes it
will go back to a tack down Stitch after
that so you can see now it's doing a
tack down Stitch where we uh placed our
heart we go all the way around and Tack
it into
place okay there's our tack down Stitch
and now we're going to let it go ahead
and go around again and Stitch the
applique Stitch just push the start
button again we're using the original
embroidery file this time
there it is doing the little applique
Stitch all the way around there's our
little
design all
done and
cute now we're going to tear off our
stabilizer or if you have cut away
you're going to have to cut it
off and it's up to you or personal
preference if you want want to remove it
from the center of the design the more
intricate Your Design the harder that's
going to be to do so um a lot of times
you'll just want to leave it in
place and there's our little
design all ready to
go or wherever you're going to use it
and there it is on the back side I uh
took the stabilizer out of the
center anyway so there we are with our
little heart and Happy Valentine's Day
