hi this is offer with Doug and Stacy and
I'm Stacy and today we're going to make
an 1800 style drink called Hay makers
[Music]
punch okay guys so we are in August
right now and it is really hot very hot
and humid here and a lot of people
always ask us you know how do you do it
because of the Heat and all that and
this is one drink that Doug and I just
like love and live on and it really
helps us get through and the funny story
about this is um back in the 1800s
that's what the farmers used to drink to
help them get through working in the
fields and working on those hot hot
summer days because this is going to be
so filled with what you want to call
electrolytes this is the original
original sports drink and it is
something if you love lemonade you will
love this because it is fabulous I mean
we totally look forward to getting this
so very simple to make I'm going to do
it in a half gallon jar as you can see
right here I put some um filtered water
in here you don't want to use
chlorinated water make sure you have
good clean water um so this is for a
half gallon and the only thing I need
for this is a nub of Ginger so I you I
already peeled this you know a nice you
know 2in piece and then a whole big
lemon I've already cut it up a little
bit apple cider vinegar
and either honey raw honey or maple
syrup because between the two you're and
originally in the ingred I think they
actually used the maple syrup but what
you guys can do is alternate some days
maybe do it with raw um honey some days
do it with the maple syrup because
they're both wonderful filled with
minerals and enzymes that you need and
they're so healthy and it's a great
alternative to using sugar so definitely
these are your two choices over sugar
because there're so much more beneficial
so all you're going to do is in your
half gallon put about A3 of a
cup of raw apple cider vinegar with the
mother in it
okay and that in itself is great for
your metabolism for your immune
system and then I'm going to go ahead
and get my Ginger and I'm going to cut
it up ginger root is great for
inflammation for um bloating just just a
wonderful wonderful
herb whoops
okay and then I'm going to Squeeze My
Lemon in there and if some of you guys
when you're doing this and you've tasted
it after the first time and you think
hey I think I want more lemons in there
put more lemons in
it and then when I'm done squeezing all
these lemons in there
I can't decide if I want to do honey
this time or if I want to do maple
syrup let's
see you know lemons are great and
detoxifying a lot of vitamin C from them
I'm going to put some honey in it so the
honey I'm going to go ahead and I'm
going to put in about 5
tablespoons
okay and if want to put a little bit
more in put a little bit more
in and then I'm going to shake it up
really really really really
good and then I'm going to put it into
the refrigerator or the ice box
for um 12 to 24
hours
okay Shake It
Up really
good
and then I've already done one here I
mean I look forward to this on a hot day
there's nothing more refreshing it
totally totally makes me uh kind of perk
up so I look forward to having my
Haymakers Punch drink they also called
switchel and you're finding a little bit
more Resurgence of this um a lot of
people are starting to offer it at
different trendy restaurants and things
like that too and it's so easy to make
and I know a lot of you guys say say you
know maybe you don't like kombucha or
the Beet Cabas there's different
fermented drinks that you can do this is
something that's very helpful and
beneficial for your body um and it's so
