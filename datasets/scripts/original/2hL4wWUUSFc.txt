okay so when we came to our property we
saw that they had some Stakes with some
flagging on them and those Stakes
usually um are the property Corners they
they'll say what they are like this one
says lot five on this side says lot four
which is ours on the other side right
down there but when you see these Stakes
the stakes are only a real good flag for
the actual monument that a surveyor has
to put in when they locate the property
corner and you can see it right here you
you can see what that actual Monument is
that Yellow Cap that's actually a a
rebar with a yellow cap and it's got a
number on it and that number corresponds
with the number on your plat map or your
property map so that's how we found our
property corners and this is going to go
on that property corner I'm going to go
all the way to the other side of the
property and then I'm going to locate it
with the surveyor's Transit and then
we'll know where our property line
is okay hold it up as high as you can
and wave
it okay I can see now now bring it down
nice and
slow that's about where it disappears

level right where your left foot
