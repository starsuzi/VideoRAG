sometimes with older photos
they become discolored depending on the
environment there in
this photo was hanging on a wall had
direct sunlight
for a couple hours a day for many years
were going to try to do a couple
techniques to bring the color back into
this photo and get rid of some of this red
be warned tho this is only
basic techniques and no matter what you
do it's never gonna go back to its
original state
and these are just quick and easy
techniques
you can get a little bit more
complicated and get better results and
better color
but its going to take a lot longer than the
two or three minutes
it's gonna take us for this photo so the
first thing we're going to do is try out
Photoshops auto tone color and
and contrast commands to do that will go
up to the Image menu
and choose auto tone and then choose
auto contrast and auto color
and it did a fairly good job it still
has a little bit of a purple tint
but now we can see the purple velvet of the
dress and yes
it was a very cool dress and then we see
the white ruffles
and we're starting to see some green and pink from the background however what this did
was it
damage the original photo now your probably
saying well that's okay because we don't
like the original photos that had too
much red
but if you were to save this and then
decide later
no I wanted adjust that again or try it again
well now you've just permanently change
this original photo
we never want to do that in Photoshop so
in the history
I'll go back to my first state with the
red
in the photo and we're going to do
something called adjustment layers
in these allow us to change the color
without harming the original picture
so in the adjustments layer panel which
if you can see that panel got to window 
and choose
adjustments from here we're gonna choose
the color balance adjustment
and it adds it as a layer on top of the
original photo
and it's not harming that original photo
but it will still change its color
we have a definite problem with the red
color in this photo
so looking at these sliders if we have too
much red
we need to balance that color out by
adding its opposite
cyan and as you move that down to make
a judgment on what looks good and what
doesn't
be aware that people are usually going to
look at the face first
and so use a baby skin tone as a good
judge
on whether or not you're going too far
or not far enough
and if this one has a little bit to
magenta
too much magenta we can add a little
bit a green and then you can look if it
has little bit
too much yellow you can slide it in towards blue
and be aware that you can also change
the shadows
and the highlights as well but mid tones
is going to work for us for this picture
now if you want to refine in the color even
more
you can do a color balance that's gonna
make the background look really good
but when you do the color balance that
makes that back on the good
its gonna a effect the face and the skin
tone
and the dress of the baby here and it's
not gonna look good in those areas
so we can always do is fine a mask
technique tutorial and learn how to do
mask
on this color balance so that it only
affects the foliage
then add another adjustment so that you
can get the skin tone of her hand and her face
just right
add a mask to that and do the same
thing for the dress
if you look at my YouTube channel there
are mask tutorials up there
now what we can do is we can add other
adjustment layers if we need to add some
brightness and contrast
and then we can turn the visibility
on an offer each of those layers to see
if were liking whats happening
with our changes if we don't like him we
can throw these adjustment layers away
and try again
and if we do like em make sure to say
this is a Photoshop file so it keeps
those layers intact
which again it doesn't harm the original
photo
