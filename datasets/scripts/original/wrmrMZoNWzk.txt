hi YouTube
okay how about are you feeling hungry or
thirsty or just in the mood for
something really decadent I am so I am
going to show you how I make my
world-famous well not yet but my
world-famous
chocolate malted egg cream yummy
delicious drink let's go
so here are the ingredients les the ice
cubes because I'll be putting the ice
cubes in first we have two eggs malted
milk liquid or hershey style chocolate I
got this at probably Grocery Outlet and
a cup of milk starting with our cup of
milk I'm a little messy okay
Ice Cube's out of the truck fridge
fridge I'm breaking up the ice cubes and
they keep from dumping all the ice cubes
all over everything I want five it's
really nice having ice to make things
with so now we have the ice chilling
down the we have the ice chilling down
the milk we're gonna add our eggs one
two and now we're going to add some
malted milk how much you say well up to
three tablespoons
it's a to taste thing so
I would suggest you experiment there's
one two and three chocolate syrup well
let's see what we get one two and three
all right so we've got our ingredients
the bullet blender is connected to the
inverter and now it's time to turn the
inverter on and blend our beverage here
so we're doing all this with a little
power from the Sun and a little bit of
electronic equipment like a solar panel
a battery and a an inverter so let's go
a nice chilled glass that's been waiting
for this in the fridge
whipped cream is optional so there you
go a chocolate malted egg cream
enjoy oh yeah
