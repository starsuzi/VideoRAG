I'm Philip Tang from east by Northeast
and today we're doing cured pork belly
and for the dry spices we have Chinese
peppercorns black peppercorn star Anis
white peppercorn and cloves so we're
going to take it to a dry pan on the
stove and toast it for 2 to 3 minutes um
on medium heat until it's uh
fragrant all right and now we'll uh
grind spices and put together the
Cure so just go ahead and put all the
spices into the
grinder all right everything is nicely
ground go ahead and put it in your
bowl and add the
salt the brown
sugar and the minced
garlic you go ahead and just use a whisk
get everything nice and
incorporated or actually go ahead and
just use your hands get in there and uh
make sure everything's mixed nicely no
chunks of salt or
sugar and then we'll go ahead and put
this on the pork belly
so just go ahead and sprinkle it
generously all over the pork belly make
sure to get all
sides all right so all sides are evenly
coated
nice and go ahead and take
a 2 and2 gallon Ziploc
bag and just place them in
there the
excess go ahead and sprinkle it in over
top
and what we'll do is put this in the
refrigerator
for 7 Days um flipping over every um
every 2 to 3 days um you probably want
to put it inside a container of some
sort to prevent any um any leakage but
um after 7 days you will uh the meat
should firm up and if not you know you
can go ahead and give it a few more days
just turning it over every day or two
until it firms up so after 7 Days of
curing we uh put it onto a rack and let
it dry off for for a day or two and it
just kind of gets rid of the excess
moisture and then you have the pork
belly right here and what we do is go
ahead and slice it off it's basically
just like bacon so you can slice it off
and
make nice thick
lardons and for searing it you can go
ahead and treat this just like bacon and
we'll go ahead and put it in a nice hot
pan with just a little bit of oil sear
it till it's nice and brown and crispy
on the outside
so this is the pork belly after it's
been cut and seared and you can see it
looks just like pretty much just like
bacon um it's really great in salads in
sesame noodles or pretty much anywhere
that a recipe that calls for bacon or
Panetta um and with the pork belly that
you have cured um it freezes very well
so you can go ahead and cut it into
smaller portions bag it up and freeze it
and pull it out as you need it and and
that's uh cured pork
belly
