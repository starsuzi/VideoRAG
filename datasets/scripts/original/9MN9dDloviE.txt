[Music]
even though babies with few teeth can't
enjoy whole fruits like these beautiful
red raspberries there's no reason they
can't have homemade baby food like this
raspberry banana baby food puree it's so
sweet and creamy and has the most
beautiful red color so to start we've
got what is this chloe
banana and it's got tons of potassium
and it's really sweet and creamy can you
put that back
yeah
and i just got this baby bullet so i'm
really excited to give it a whirl want
to hold that little food processor you
could totally make this in a regular
food processor in a blender but i'm kind
of into trying this baby bullet what do
you think chloe
you're excited
so you just take one banana that's all
you need one whole banana
and you're gonna put it into this little
cup here and then i've got half a cup of
red raspberries
do you want one of the raspberries right
now

and what's easy about this is it's only
two ingredients so your baby can enjoy
i'm gonna smash it in this is a first
food and have the opportunity to taste
something that is really beautiful
sweet hasn't been sitting on a grocery
shore store shelf for weeks or even
months you're making something that's
homemade that can freeze easily
okay and raspberries are great because
they're packed with
