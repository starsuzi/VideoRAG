okay so today I'm going to show you how
I've unclogged my drain it's a Sunday
and last night we had water bubbling up
from this drain so I knew that we had an
issue so what I did is
I caught some plumbers no one could come
and they want to charge me about 500
between $350 and $500 so I looked into
renting this it's a clean out from Home
Depot now I've done one run and actually
the line is clean and what I found this
attachment was on the end which is what
comes on it it had a baby wipe on it and
some other stuff came out but basically
the main clog I think was a baby wipe so
what I'm going to do is since I've got
the thing and it cost me about
$55 I'm going to go ahead and run both
of these through there as well and I'm
going to show you how incredibly simple
this is to do and it really wasn't super
yucky either um however the only only
thing with this machine is it is on
Wheels but it's super easy to operate
but it's definitely heavy to get out of
your vehicle they'll load it for you at
Home Depot but you got to figure out how
to get it back in your car so let me go
ahead and set it up and I'll show you
how easy it is to run the thing to save
yourself a lot of money by doing this
because my clog I think came right out
and this would have cost me like I said
$3500 okay first thing is I'm going to
go ahead and attach this um
different piece on here to kind of get a
different clean out of the the thing and
it's really easy you just need
a this is gross I'm not wearing gloves
but now that I've got water I'll make
sure I clean
up and you just make sure that it's
screwed on here nice and tight you don't
want to lose it down there I'm sure Home
Depot would charge
you
oh I see it goes through the middle
learn something new every day told you I
haven't done this
before so just screw it on going to
tighten it
up okay and we're ready to go so I'm
going to go ahead and set this up and
show you how easy it is to run this
thing so here's the draining
question and all I'm going to do is I'm
just going to reverse it a little bit
with this little
button can't really see it so let me put
it over this little
um piece right
here it just reverses the
thing so I'm going to put it in reverse
and then there's a foot pedal you just
[Music]
press
okay now I'm going to go ahead and shoot
it down the hole and we're going to
press
reverse and we're just going to let it
run so I'm going to move up a little
bit and I'm going to try and get that
black guer thing down the hole as much
as I possibly can because that's going
to
help to get it down there I'm going to
go ahead
and okay change the view a little bit so
you can see a little better so here's
the machine I've got it lined up in
there and all I'm going to do is put it
in reverse I mean put it in
forward and let it run just put my foot
on the
petal
and away it
goes so this could
take 10 minutes to get all the way down
I have a 75 ft Rod uh snake and it just
self
speeds I'm just going to get myself
comfortable keep my foot on the
pedal and just let it
go
okay so that's all you
do and as you can see it's not real
difficult now I'm going to run this
second item down the
drain and uh then what I'll do is I'll
run the water and make sure that it all
works and everything but I got it for
four hours
$55 well worth it wasn't a big deal I
have to clean up anyway because some of
the water water came up so I have to
really do a good clean here so there is
a little bit of stuff that came out when
you reverse it it comes back up but
that's it this is all you do you run the
thing I would advise you run it all the
way to the end I got a 75 ft one you can
get 100t one it's a little bit more
expensive but it will go all the way out
to your line because your line is 100
ft usually from the um the Big Sewer I
don't know what you call that I'm not a
plumber so so um definitely give it a
try it's not a twers deal other than to
get the thing out of the car but you can
do it all by yourself it's really simple
and it saves you a lot of money all
right enjoy I'm going to go ahead and
just show you how easy it is to
reverse you just put it in
reverse and you step on the
face now
sometimes as you're running this thing
the um hose will kind of start to come
back up it's just having trouble it's
getting jammed a little bit so sometimes
you have
to let it
run and you got to hold it down and see
how it's coming up so I'm just going to
stop it reverse
it so it's it's just getting it's stuck
on something down in there so all I got
to do just reverse it you got to hold it
[Music]
[Music]
down and then it's fine again so
sometimes it needs to be kind of
Rebooted
[Music]
so that's pretty much it I hope you
don't have this problem but if you do
this is the way to solve it any
questions just uh leave a comment and I
basically check it every day so I will
get back to
you see you
