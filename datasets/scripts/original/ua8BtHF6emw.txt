 
So what I learned when I was taking the fabric off
the couch is the order in which it was put together
so it looks like
what I need to start with is the seat of the couch
followed by the back rest
 
and then do the two sides
followed by the back of the couch
and finally the bottom of the couch
what I did to cover the seat of the couch
is I took a piece that I had ripped off that wasn't too damaged by the process
 
and I went ahead and washed it and
sewed a piece of thin material
to the back of it
What I'm going to do now is tuck the seat fabric in to place before stapling it.
I've tucked it as far as possible back in to the couch and tried to keep it nice and smooth
I also left a little flap at the front
 
and I'm going to use that to staple it in to the front part of the
seat here. Ok and once you stapled the front
together then using the fabric
that has been pulled through
go ahead and staple the material to the frame
 
Now that the seat is all stapled
in then set your front piece layed out how you'd like it
and then flip it over
so that it has a tiny bit of a flap. Put it up against the front piece and staple that in
 
 
 
Now I have the seat stapled in so I can go ahead and get started on the side rests.
 
for the side rests there will be two pieces
I'll have the stripes going down on the sides
here and then this is for the padded part of the rest
 
from the other side of the armrest
flip up the excess material and the material that you tucked in on the other side
go ahead and staple that to the frame
so it will be nice and tight
now the top
part of the side cushion is all stapled in
so I'm going to take the bottom piece
and lay it on the top cushion evenly
 
Then what I'm going to do is take these tacks
and tack it in to place
 
underneath where the material hits the wood so that it will be nice and straight and then I'm going to come by with my staple gun and staple it in
 
 
 
once all stapled in  just flip it
over
and staple the two sides and the bottom
 
the back rest is the next step
so just drape your material
over the back rest and tuck it in as best you can.
This gives you a good idea of how big a piece you want to cut
 
 
I'm going to start in on the back of the couch.
 
I'm going to staple it in as straight as I can along the back
 
 
I got a good idea on how to upholster the backside of a couch from Kim's Upholstery. You can also follow along at this link.
 
now I'm going to put in the foam backing
which is still in pretty good shape from the 
old couch
 
I have the couch tilted forward so I can do the backing
 
and I'm just going to reuse the metal slates.
poke the slates through the material
 
this will create a nice straight seam in the back
you won't have to do any hand sewing
roll the material
as tight as you can
ok and then hammer it in
 
 
 
now the couch is starting to look like
an actual
couch just needs the cushions and the front
