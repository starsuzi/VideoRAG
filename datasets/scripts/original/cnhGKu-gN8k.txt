Hi YouTube is Monsieur Bonsai!
There are a few weeks, the buds of my wisteria swelled
then began pecking.
It was the perfect opportunity to observe
flowering under a new eye.
In this third video on the evolution
This bonsai development,
I invite you to contemplate Mother Nature in all its vivacity.
This timelapse was photographed indoors with no wind, natural or artificial.
What you see is the movement of the plant itself, it simply was accelerated.
I hope you enjoyed this short but relaxing video

Thank you and see you soon.
