after lots of requests I'm finally going
to show you how to make cake
[Music]
pops to start crumble up your sponge
into a bowl you can use shop B like I'm
doing here or you can use your favorite
sponge recipe but make sure if you have
any hard edges to cut those
off click here if you would like to
watch a sponge recipe from SC
scatch the amount of frosting you add
depends on how moist your cake is mine
already sticks together when I squeeze
it so I'm only adding two
spoonfuls once you have your crumbs
spoon in your frosting of choice and mix
with a spoon until
[Music]
combined only add a small amount at a
time as you can always add more
you don't want to add too much frosting
as it will taste like someone has chewed
it and it won't hold its shape and you
don't want to add too little otherwise
it will crumble
apart once it's all combined roll into
bows and place on a baking tray lined
with baking
parchment for Perfect Cake Pops I
suggest using something that will make
them all even I'm using this small ice
cream scoop around 1 and 1/2 in wide but
you can use a measuring
spoon to get nice smooth cake pops
squeeze the sponge to get rid of any
Pockets before rolling in the palm of
your
hand dip your sticks into some melted
candy melts and press it into your cake
pop around 3/4 of the way in
[Music]
pop the tray of candy melts into the
freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes while
you prepare your candy melts and your
toppings I'm using candy melts for my
topping you can either melt them over a
double boiler or melt them in the
microwave I'm adding half a tablespoon
of vegetable oil to mine to make it a
thinner consistency if you're in America
you can use shortening or if you prefer
to leave this out that's no problem but
you may need to spoon it onto the cake
pop as it's a bit thick to
dip finally tap and rotate the cake pop
to get rid of any excess and decorate
however you would
[Music]
like place them into some Polish Irene
to keep them upright until they dry

f
