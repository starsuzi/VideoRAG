well hello
everybody Welcome to My doy
yourself reef aquarium fish
trap I love YouTube every time you have
a problem uh you just get on the web and
look up YouTube and you see all kinds of
solutions uh and the most uh intriguing
one is just taking a coke bottle cutting
the top off and turning it around and
making a fish trap out of it but we
don't drink a lot of soda in this house
and I didn't have any Coke
bottles so uh I looked around the house
and I came across this glass jar that my
wife had laying around for plants or
whatever reason and uh I thought about
this and decided
to make it into a fish
trap and what I did here is I just uh
took a plastic bag and cut off a
[Applause]
corner and then cut the seam and order
that I may uh stretch it over to
top
but uh you need to cut the seam the
opposite corner
of the opposite side of the corner that
you cut the
opening that's why you see me uh cutting
it twice here uh made a mistake that you
can learn
from
so here we have it we put the fish trap
in the
aquarium and oh boy I just wish I had
the camera going because 15 seconds
after I put it in the aquarium that
yellow tang that just peaked out at you
here he uh he went right in the fish
trap I had put a little a few little
food pellets and uh he went right in now
here the
Dusky Doty back this fish has been
aggressive uh I just put a new fish in
and this Dusky doy back is just tearing
him the shreds and I've lost other fish
and I think it's because of him and I
decided it's time for him to go and uh
how do you get him out of a reef
aquarium and so this fish trap oh it
looked like it's going to work so well
here and he's poking around in there he
smells the pellets uh that's just an
illusion he did not go in he's on the
outside looking
in and
uh he's looking it over so is the yellow
tang even though the yellow tang has
been caught and released already once
he's still very curious you know I cut
that uh the corner of the the ziplock
bag here uh I had no idea that it I
thought it was just too small for the
yellow tang to get into it and yet uh
sure enough that yellow tank did get in
uh but why isn't this Dusky dam is a
whole okay for him uh once I had
released the yellow tank I had to re
stretch this bag over and I got to make
sure the hole is in the right position
and it looks like it
is but I'm having difficulty here
getting the Dusky in there at least I'm
impatient a lot of people just put these
traps in their tank go away for a few
hours and then come back and they have
their fish well yeah the only trouble is
you may have the wrong fish in there and
uh you wasted time so here I put a
little food in uh this time some M and
shrimp instead of just fish pellets I
just want to drive them crazy now um and
maybe I can catch him
quicker uh than waiting hours for him to
go in the
Trap so let's see what happens
now well certainly yellow tang is
curious as
always and here comes the Dusky Danel
fish Rock Beauty behind
him that rock Beauty doesn't take any
crap from the Dusky danzel he he lets
him know he's
boss but my rock beauty doesn't uh
bother any of the other
fish so he's not a
trouble sorry if I said Dusky danzel I
meant Dusky
doback and Dusky dback seems to
have more interest on this side of the
Trap than on the open
side he keeps looking at the food
there and I just decide that maybe I
need to flip this thing
around I just want to out of there I'm a
little bit
impatient so I'm going to flip it around
and uh see if I can get him to go in the
other
direction well here he is he's on
the open side now and he's a little
coaxing from the yellow
tank and uh with a little coaxing he's
in there and he gets his prize M shrimp
good for
him got
him well everybody I hope that uh helps
got
