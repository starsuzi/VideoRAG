welcome to Jazz Club nice right dude
welcome to the Channel all dudes welcome
all dudes to the channel if you're new
to the channel welcome to the channel if
you're not new to the channel you've
heard that a thousand times before you
most going to start hting me for it but
I'm going to keep saying it um me and
bib once again are battling the um the
odds to get you some decent
footage um for ianz again in in the
lovely Jam studio over in St hens which
is an upside down boat it actually is um
so we're using the lovely L5 Lany
amplification unit today to give you
those dul Jazz tones and here we have
the absolutely amazing AR ianz which is
really really quite nice this is the
620 and it's very very very very nice um
it's very less poly dare I say SG yeah
you can say it I'm fine with it you fine
with that I hate this whole it's a
single style an F style the F now this
is like sounds like this is an LP style
guitar so with this you get that the
kind of
VI I say VI the vine of Life the Tree of
Life inlay the ianz are famous forine
Steve Vine like what you did there
Vitality points to there um
very less poly it's got the ebony neck
ebony fretboard on there which is really
really nice quite a chunky style neck
which I'm not really used to but kind of
feels nice I'm I'm warming to it um it's
got the fat finger long finger little
finger stinky finger finger pickups
which are very very cool also what you
get is this
trone um kind of that's not theoretical
so you get a parallel standard um hbook
at or um split coil for each of the
pickups which is absolutely amazingly
versatile and then because of the lp
nature of this
instrument see what did there bab um you
get the a tone and volume pair inst of
pair pickup as well really really user
friendly got this nice kind of bolt-on
neck but the neck joints obviously been
kind of tend to almost a neck through
feeling um heel which is awesome
very very nice it I like this Livery I'm
a fan of the white and gold Hardware
bbby maybe not so much I do not like it
but there is a black and gold one I do
like that
one and so again limited color options
for this year but available kind of
knock and round through premium
dealers really really cool obviously at
the start of the video you'll have seen
all of the gobbin that come with the
instrument but just going to have a
little play through now obviously
because there's so many bleeding options
on this guitar we're going to limit
those options slightly um well see how
we get on and so what you hear there was
uh me trying to play jazz inspired C
voicing uh I'm going to do that again so
what we had there was the
split and then we've
got
parallel and then your hooker so that's
how it kind of works
[Music]
um and then
parallel dare I say it Strat sounding oh
s style s style sounding
[Music]
gobbin you can't Style because makes me
think of an Ser okay so I have to say so
you can say just Strat I'm going to say
[Music]
Strat call Fender poo what are they
going to do Nish find us they going to
do
nothing do nothing I afraid of
you I afraid of you f fer so um we're
never going to befriender oh right so
and then humer so
obviously kind of hear that now kicking
the amp into a little bit of natural
Drive which might be great for
[Music]
you noodles good for noodles is that
tone Oh yeah and I am using a little bit
too much delay I do apologize um right
so the next so that was our Rhythm
pickup both together now here's where
things get interesting because I can
have that bad boy in parallel this bad
boy in Split
[Music]
coil make sure you just want to play
thir
chords that's a woody tone bro that's
what that is right there that's a woody
tone
bro so wow yeah that's usable I reckon
um for those jazz jazz cats but again
it's still
[Music]
even it's a great clean tone um and then
we put it on the treble pickup and again
let's go through the options of that
trione thing so parallel
[Music]
[Applause]
split and then standard hook
[Music]
you can hear that driveing the amp again
because we're getting the all of the
beans back in tone controls as per usual
so that takes your
tone and puts it behind a pillow that's
what those buttons are for If I Ever Had
a Sig model it wouldn't they wouldn't
exist don't ever use do you ever use
tone control only if I'm playing CL
covers and I want woman tone woman tone
roll just a piece of it or you roll the
whole deal no I bu behind two whole
pillows all right so
[Music]
uh don't know why I played Stevie Wonder
SP RI
[Music]
there is that kind of that's more
muffled than I would normally get yeah
it's got a lot of sweep that underneath
a pillow which is underneath a mattress
underneath your bed a big fat lady oh
not your bed then my bed oh not my bed b
oh who whoa cutting that
[Music]

a drives tone so now we've got the
Rhythm pickup on in its front position
