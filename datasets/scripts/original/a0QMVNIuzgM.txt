well hello again folks and welcome back
to the cabin it's a frosty day here
today but I'm keeping busy out on the
front porch as I restore a 1910 waffle
iron I'm going to film the process for
you all and I'll show you how you can
take a rusty old Relic and turn it into
a fine piece of
cookware
[Applause]
[Music]
the first step is to soak your rusty
iron wear in a solution of at least 60%
white vinegar to 40% water this iron
soaked in straight vinegar for 24 hours
and then I scrubbed away all the rust
with a plastic brush I avoid steel
brushes to prevent the cooking surface
from getting
scratched after after thoroughly rinse
in the iron I dry it with the towel and
apply a light coating of olive oil
before I place it on a
burner base you can see it's Rusty I
have not started scraping this yet see
how that
looks this is just what a plastic
[Music]
brush look at that right down to the
bare iron
[Music]
see
that that's just with a plastic
brush coming out real
nice I put a little bit of oil in a
cup and I use a pastry brush for the
waffle side here I'm just going to put a
very light coating of oil wipe off the
excess okay that's very important to
wipe off that excess if you leave gobbs
of oil on here you're going to end up
with a sticky
pan this side
here very light coating of
oil you can see that using the gas grill
is the best way to do it because of the
smoke and I'm going to be flipping it
over and over
constantly wiping away the
excess want to make sure you're wearing
gloves so you don't get
burned today I'm restoring a waffle iron
but I use the same process the extra
burner of the gas grill for all of my
iron
wear especially when I'm doing the
initial coats on some bare iron like I
am
today I'm not worried about the smoke it
can smoke all it
wants and I I can put coat after coat
after
coat as opposed to the slow method which
is done in the oven I'm going to keep
repeating this process over and over and
over don't try and rush it by putting on
a heavy coat of oil a heavy coat of oil
will be your worst enemy the worst thing
you can do for this pan so when I look
inside here and I see any little puddles
I'm going to wipe them away with a Q-tip
get rid of them because of that that
dries I will always have uneven coats of
seasoning in My
Pan not what I want to achieve here
couple little puddles in
there got them taken care of this is
going to be a nice iron anytime you see
me restoring iron wear you will hear me
repeat myself many
times about wiping away the excess
oil I can't overemphasize that because
that will be your key to success oh this
is coming out just beautiful just
beautiful now I will repeat the process
by applying multiple coats of oil to
each side as the oil becomes carbonized
it will offer a beautiful non-stick
surface to the
[Music]
iron
yep well that turned out really nice
but I'm completely out of waffle mix
here at the cabin going to be heading
back to the homestead in a little while
I'll mix up a batch of waffle batter put
that on the gas burner see how she
performs I'm pretty certain she's going
to do a good
job okay I have this on like a medium
heat as you can see
there I've got it on a four and a
half I'm going to let the iron get good
and hot on one side I'm going to flip it
over let it get good and hot on that
side then I'm going to flip it back and
pour the batter
in okay let's give it a goal we maiden
voyage I cooked the waffles oh maybe a
minute minute and a half or so on each
side I can't give you a specific time
because I don't know what you're going
to set your temperature at but here
working on about a medium heat generally
60 to 90 seconds on each side is just
about
perfect oh look at
that pops right out of
there pretty amazing is isn't it that
iron came out of the vinegar bath this
morning I gave it one coat here on the
gas then hauled it over to the cabin
where I have the gas grill and finish
the process so it went from Trash to
Treasure in one
day beautiful waffle right here didn't
stick at all I'd say it was a
success well if you like what you
