see we're not gonna get on this roof
because we don't will get on any route
unless we absolutely have to and you
should be able to clean a roof without
getting on it huh marina blue caps of
magma which is just a mold that comes
this for the Caribbean anyways I've got
one coat I'm pre treated it already what
we're doing here is a plant water
product that might come down
sorry
like free
make sure your ladders Isis a first
the product runs off pretty quick
the house did have one coat on half of
it here it just put it on as you can see
you know you will get a tile that's a
new tile and the finish is coming off on
it
a lot of these white tiles they leave
the mold on so long that it eats the
finish away I'll show you right here
this is the selling factor for these
people if you can see that white home
right through the chimney stack right
there there's if I can zoom in at home
right there across the bay at home we
did and it was cool coated before had a
good coating on there and so it did not
have or it came a lot cleaner this one
that concrete is gonna show a little bit
through there even through with the soft
wash use
we have let the surfactant and the roof
wash sit for about 15 minutes and
because here in South Texas we don't get
much rain we simulate the rain by
we'll rinse the roof now
between coats washes a lot of that
mold dead mold it helps it break it off
a little bit so when we do your second
coat it will rinse a lot better clean
the white that you want it to
