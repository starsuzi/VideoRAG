go hi it's Brian from Carson Associates
and today I want to talk to you about uh
why get a land survey many of you may
may wonder why should I get one well let
me give you an example here we have uh a
fence and the neighboring
property uh the the dirt and the trees
are knocking the fence over onto this
property and the problem is if you don't
know if the wall or the fence is on your
property uh who's going to pay for it so
that's why it's important to get a
survey when something like this happens
prime example uh you got to figure out
who's the responsible party that's going
to pay for uh the repair of the fence so
um if you have any other questions uh
feel free to give us a call at 408
