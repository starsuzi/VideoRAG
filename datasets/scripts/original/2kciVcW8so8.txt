here I have some dandelions in my yard
and because I don't spray my yard with
any kind of chemicals I am going to cut
up a bunch of these leaves collect them
and put them in a salad that's my school
is Los Feliz
very well now I'm going to cut them up
and I like to use scissors cut them in
small pieces to add to your favorite
salad I still haven't have a spinach
salad here with carrots so I'm going to
add my cut up dandelion and put on your
favorite salad dressing and it's really
quite delicious and very high in
antioxidants because it is a wild plant
