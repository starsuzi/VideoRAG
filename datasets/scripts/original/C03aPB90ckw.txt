hi I'm an with jwel tool and in this
series I'm going to show you how to
grind repair and polish
stones to repair any scratches or chips
you should use your micr finishing
Diamond kit here I'm using the 20 Micron
which is marked very fine I'll run it at
medium to low
speed with a little bit of water just
dab it apply some water to the disc and
to the stone and you hold it right in
the
center and give it the much needed cut
to smooth and remove the scratches it's
very wise to take a good look at it here
if there's any SC scratches because from
this stage on we're going to head
straight to the pro Diamond kit which
only brings the stone to a high
polish we're going to start off with the
1800 that is considered step one you run
this very
slow again with
water and here's a helpful tip you might
want to if it's a dark stone use a
silver
Sharpie just in the beginning until you
get the hang of how to hold the stone
but the stone should be nonp porous
surface and you can see right
here how the stone is polishing up so
you don't miss a single little
spot this is the finish at
1,800 and and then we'll continue on
with step two at 3000 grit again running
slow with
water I roll I teeter totter I lift and
I twist as long as you keep a nice
pressure up against the wheel you're
going to get a nice finish using the 3M
diamond
now you're going to see much more Shine
using the 8000 which is step
three never use the edge of the
disc cuz it can give you uneven
Cuts always use the center and mid area
of the disc
this is at
8,000 now 50,000 which is the next step
and serium oxide will take you to that
high luster finish and even if you have
fine scratches you can only just use
these wheels and you'll be fine
this is at 50,000
dry serium oxide is impregnated in the
disc form made by 3M again run very slow
with lots of water serium oxide loves
water and you see there's a little bit
of a white discharge off of the disc and
that's what you want to achieve is that
nice slurry effect because that is the
high Polishing Compound within the
serium
oxide
and this is your final
result a high
quality better than lab finish this is
an agot with about a 8 to n level of
hardness so any stone that is in the
sapphire Ruby world like the Cor family
the diamond AB braces by 3M can handle
it and of course anything softer is a
breeze
