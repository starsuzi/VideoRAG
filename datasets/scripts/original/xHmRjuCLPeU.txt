I'm going to share with you today
yogurt how we make a yogurt
in other words
typical Punjabi drawing how we make a
dying the curd
I have um
one gallon which is 3.7 8 liter meal
vitamin D
so two liter of milk you
boil the milk
up to the boiling point so you dip your
finger inside the milk
is kind of lukewarm
not
too hot not too cold you can I'm using
these um you know containers I already
have this one washed you know so what
I'm gonna be doing I'm gonna pour in
my milk another as you see a little bit
uh you know hard you see that the smoke
coming out
so
this is a perfect choice
yogurt this is the yoga to previous yoga
to what we have this is called in our
Punjabi language Indian language jog
so you need one
one teaspoon
or you can do it too that is good enough
that is a perfect
and use basically just mix it up and
that's good enough so I will take you to
my processing plant household blanket
the Moon is warm keep your feet swarm
keep one down for kitchen going to be
over storage
I'm going to lay down this one here
I'm going to cover this one
can you see it okay
I'm going to cover it nicely you have to
tuck it nicely
once it's all tucked
how nicely then I'm going to push it
back
now I'm going to let it sit this one
over here for four hours
you can put it into microwave or you can
put your oven you can just stick it in
there after four hours I recommend four
hours don't do it at night time you go
to sleep and you're waking up to 10
hours that's not a problem joke it will
be done but
it will not give you the Perfection
you're looking sweet nice creamy yogurt
it's gonna be sour
so once it's get a longer period of time
it turns into sour it's already four
hours and I'm going to take down my
blanket
you unwrap that
I'm gonna bring it here
and I'm just gonna see I'm gonna close
in
I'm gonna open
nice beautiful yogurt now I'm going to
okay
now what we need to do
is Support over processing the yogurt is
made
in order to make it a more solid Phi we
need to put it in a fridge and it's
for two hours
at least two hours because then it will
solidify more you
longer the period it's better because
it's going to sit there it's not gonna
harm anything but yes hi so it's about
two hours we're gonna pull the jacket
out
taking the yogurt out
see once you put it in the fridge oh
it's get cold I see
so I'm going to remove the layer
perfect
and I'm going to share with you
my yogurt
we can close in how beautiful it looks
beautiful okay
and
if you can close in
see this is the one thing I'm saying how
the yogurt is nicely done beautiful if
you buy from
store
you won't have this kind of yogurt look
at the yogurt
I already fall in love with it look at
this
nice I can mix
when I mix it you still can see how the
yogurt turns out nice
okay I'm going to try it
