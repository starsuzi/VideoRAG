CBS 2'S STEPHANIE TANTILLO
SHOWS US HOW A WEED AND A GRAIN
THAT ARE NUTRITIOUS AND
DELICIOUS.
REPORTER: HEY, GUYS.
SO OUR MAIN FOCUS TODAY IS
GOING TO BE ON DAN DE LION
GREENS.
THESE ARE MISTAKEN FOR A PESKY
GREEN, BUT THEY ARE A FANTASTIC
EDIBLE GREEN THAT HAVE THIS
BEAUTIFUL BITTER FLAVOR.
WHILE IT MAY VARY A LITTLE BIT
TOO BITTER FOR SOME PALLETS,
THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO MELLOW
IT DOWN AN MAKE IT REALLY,
REALLY TASTY.
SOAK IT IN SOME SALTED WATER,
BLANCH IT AND SAUTI IT WITH
SOME ONIONS AND GARLIC.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT
REALLY FUN.
WE HAVE THIS SAUTIED RIGHT HERE
WITH A LOT OF ONIONS AND
GARLIC.
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS
MIX IT IN WITH SOME FARRO.
THAT'S A CRACK WHEAT, VERY,
VERY COMMON IN ITALY AND ALSO
VERY COMMONLY IN ITALY WITH
CHEESE AN BLACK PEPPER.
NOW, YOU WANT TO STIR THIS IN
WHEN THERE'S STILL A LITTLE BIT
OF THE COOKING WATER IN HERE SO
THAT IT GETS NICE AND CREAMY.
WE ACTUALLY COOK THE FARRO IN
THE SAME WATER THAT WE BLANCH
THE DANDELION GREENS IN BECAUSE
THAT WATER HAS A LOT OF FLAVOR
IN IT.
WE BLANCHED THEM IN THERE FOR
ABOUT FOUR MINUTES.
WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND
PLATE IT JUST LIKE THAT.
NOW THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT
THIS DISH, LIKE I SAID, THOSE
GREENS, THEY ARE BITTER.
WE MUTED THEM A LITTLE BIT, BUT
THEY STILL DO HAVE THAT BITE.
BUT WHEN YOU ADD IN THAT CHEESE
AND THAT FARRO, IT JUST
COMPLETELY CREAMS IT UP, MAKES
IT NICE AND TASTY, A LITTLE BIT
OF OIL RIGHT ON TOP AND YOU'RE
ALL DONE.
THIS IS A FANTASTIC DISH TO
HAVE, AND IT'S ACTUALLY VERY,
VERY NUTRITIOUS, THAT CRACK
WHEAT HAS A LOT OF FIBER AND
THERE ARE TONS OF VITAMINS IN
THE GREENS.
