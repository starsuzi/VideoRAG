so you're obviously going to need your
dirty brushes so the first brush you're
going to be cleaning
is a jelly scrubber or a standard rubber
curry cone
the next thing we're going to be
cleaning is a man and tail comb or brush
and then a natural bristle brush if it's
a go hair
or a horse hair whatever and
any other stiff bristled brushes you
might have
also the last thing we're going to be
cleaning is our hoof pick
you're going to want to start out with a
bucket of water if
it's from a hose or a faucet whatever is
your preference
i'm just going to need some dish soap i
ended up using this kind
last but not least we are going to need
some type of object like
q-tips or toothpicks to really get into
the crevices of your brushes
now you're going to just add a small
amount of soap to your bun
now to just kind of mix everything
around just stir
the soap in the bucket now you're going
to drop all your synthetic brushes into
the bucket
allow the brushes to stay face down
now you're just going to work the soap
into each brush and this is so important
because
you need to really get in between the
bristles
so that you're not just rubbing dirt
back on your horse
and especially with the bases those can
get pretty dirty as well
and with the combs in the curries you
just might want to rinse them off
and i learned this the hard way but make
sure you're very careful when you're
cleaning hoof picks or anything that has
a metal part on it because if it dries
wrong
it will rust and also the inside of the
jelly scrubber can get really disgusting
now take your toothpick or q-tip and
just really get in the crevices of your
brush
lay down the brushes in the water for
about five minutes
face down now if you have natural
bristle brushes it's very important to
keep them
very nice and well taken care of
so now we're just going to fill the
bucket with
a a little amount of water
and a mild amount of soap do not get the
wood backing
wet because it will crack like crazy
and if you allow your bristles to dry
out of place
they will be crooked
so now you're just going to get your
brushes all rinsed out
and placed face down in a non-soapy
water bucket
so just leave your brushes on a towel
outside
where they can dry face down so that the
glue
does not get messed up and you are done
i hope you guys enjoyed this video
