hi everybody i'm kimberly turner from
cookingwithkimberly.com and tonight i'm
going to show you how to roast turm now
i have a beautiful ontario turnip from
harvest farm country markets make sure
you check out my review on these
oh they have been so delicious so
tonight i'm going to show you how to
roast one
we often mash it and that's usually
where it stops but we're going to do
some other delicious recipes and show
you how we do them okay so first things
first i need to peel this guy off and
i'm just going to use a vegetable peeler
you can peel it however you like
if you want to just cut off the outside
please feel free to do so i like to peel
mine okay so i'm going to chop my um
turnip into bite-sized chunks maybe an
inch and a half by an inch and a half or
so
you can eyeball it
good chunk
and i'm going to put it in a roasting um
pan here
you can put it on a cookie sheet you can
put it in a baking dish
whatever you have
now roasting things
accentuates it concentrates their flavor
makes them even a little bit sweeter and
even tastier than just boiling them
plus you retain more of the nutrients in
them than boiling them in that water
what a gorgeous turnip inside look at
that beautiful flesh
perfect
so tonight i'm serving these alongside a
beautiful braised napajax apple cider
bourbon pork riblets that are going to
be
stupendous so i have them in the oven
right now and i'm negotiating between
two temperatures i would typically want
to do these on 400 degrees but
my pork riblets are like on 360. so i'm
going to turn it up to 370. it's going
to be okay and we're just going to let
them go a little bit longer okay
let's douse these guys with some olive
oil maybe a couple tablespoons i freshly
ground some black pepper
we always like a little bit of spice a
little bit of cayenne and turnip tend to
take a particularly large amount of salt
in my opinion to season them nicely so
i'm going to add a little bit of salt
and i guess we can finish it off on our
plate if we need to don't want to add
too much for people that aren't into
that much salt so let's just coat these
guys use your hands get in there
and coat them all up nicely
this is a nice way to do them for the
holidays if you don't want to mash them
if you don't have
extra room on your stovetop with
everything cooking this is a good way to
get it done okay so we're gonna roast
these guys up until they are knife
tender and a little bit browned on top
into the oven they go probably about 40
to 50 minutes maybe up to an hour since
we're on 370. okay
i'm going to check on these guys in
about 20 minutes
all right let's check on these guys it's
been
a good 20 minutes we're just gonna turn
these guys around
make sure they're coated in that olive
oil nicely and they're roasting evenly
they look and they smell delicious and
i'm going to just check for doneness see
how much further we have to go
oh these have quite a ways to go which
is great because my pork riblets do too
so into the oven i would say they're
going to take at least another 30
minutes they've already been in there
for 30 okay so back in the oven
[Music]
all right these guys look great they're
browned
they smell awesome i would venture to
say these guys are done it's been
another 30 minutes
look at these guys i'm just turning them
over in that olive oil now just test
them for doneness
oh these guys are done
beautiful
let me show them to you so there you
have it that's how you roast turnip so
easy to do you just put it in set it and
forget it pretty much
so let me try one of these for you
without burning myself
that's good
they're tender all the way through
they're browned on the outside
they are so intensified in turnip flavor
slightly sweet absolutely delicious i
hope that you'll try it turn up
different ways other than just match
okay they're easy to do this was just
thrown in the oven then you come back
and it's pretty much done okay
these are really really tasty and i know
that we'll be doing them a lot more
perfect for the holidays great for a
midweek dinner whatever great side dish
for the fall and winter okay so get out
