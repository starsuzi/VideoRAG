this is product number one zero nine
three six nine the white diamond net
nylon tool so this is a stiffer tool so
it's a little bit itchy er than most we
would definitely recommend putting a
lining underneath it just for extra
comfort this would be a really good
fabric to use if you're trying to add
volume to a skirt or a sleeve in terms
of making a petticoat but it would also
be a really nice fabric to do costume to
to the fabric is nylon so it is machine
washable but we do recommend hand
washing
