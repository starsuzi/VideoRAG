i've had these stains on my stove that
will not come off i've scrubbed and
scrubbed and it won't
finally i saw something on facebook that
said that if you use
baking soda
dawn and a scrubby pad
it will work so let's see if this will
work
it said to turn the stove on and just
let it
heat up a bit and then turn it off
and then add some water onto the stove
then comes the baking soda
then to let the baking soda sit for a
bit
a few seconds
can you see it steaming
i don't know
i then took a washcloth and squished it
around
i think i may have added too much water
gonna sprinkle a little bit more of the
baking soda
don't know why but i did
next the dawn
on a scrubby pad
now i'm going to use some elbow grease
and scrub away
and look
looks like it's working
bye
finally a clean looking stove again
i'm so glad i stumbled upon that comment
on facebook that day
now my life will never be the same
nice clean stove
you
