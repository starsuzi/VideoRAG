today on hot thai kitchen we are making papaya 
salad or some fun so a big half welcome to my  
kitchen today we're taking a trip to Isaan or 
northeastern thailand and we're having we're  
making one of their staple dishes green papaya 
salad in the center dialect we call it some  
thumb in Isaan dialect which is where my mom has 
come my mom comes from we call it tum som or  
in certain areas we call it tum bak hoong ok so 
let's get started first we have the green papaya  
now the way you deal with this is now what we 
want eventually is shreds 2 cups of shredded  
green papaya like this now how you get to that 
point so I'm going to show you first just take  
a good peeler just peel the whole thing now to 
get the shreds you could use a julienne peeler  
like this which would be easier and faster you 
can get these at Asian stores don't use the  
Western julienne peelers because these actually 
make really really fine shreds and that won't  
work here but all you really need is a knife 
so here's how we do it old-school you take a  
knife you hold the papaya and then you're just 
going to make a whole bunch of incisions down  
the papaya just like this make sure you go deep 
enough and watch your fingers obviously then you  
can do one area at a time or you can do the whole 
thing it's up to you now when you feel confident  
that you've got the you know enough incisions to 
make Julian's what you're going to do is you're  
going to take your knife and just shave it off 
like this and then what you end up with is nice  
little Julian's like that and you just repeat 
once you've taken out the first layer do the  
chop chop chop again because otherwise you just 
get a big sheet of papaya and then what you have  
is beautiful shots just like all right so let's 
get started so this is what we're using our clay  
mortar and pestle with a wooden pestle and this is 
made specifically for making playas out it's light  
duty one so it's not going to crush and grind say 
things like curry paste but it's great for this  
it's larger let's start first with some garlic 
and chilies so got three small cloves of garlic  
and two Thai chilies and then we're just going 
to start pounding when you're pounding chilies  
at first don't look at it because we look at 
it it will jump into your oven just happened  
to me before once it's it's kind of gone going 
then you can look at it but in the beginning  
is where it likes to shoot so when it's kind of 
it's it's all mushed up but not liquefied what  
you don't want is big chunks of garlic or chili 
once that's done we're going to go in with dried  
shrimp I've got a tablespoon and a half of small 
dry shrimp if you got big ones you can rough chop  
it a little bit they're like shrimp jerky gives a 
lot of mommy flavor just add that nice savoriness  
to the dish just for a plate so the shrimp are 
broken down a little bit and then we're going  
to go in with the rough vegetables so things go 
in in order of roughness so the delicate things  
will go and last the rougher things will go in 
first this is five long bean so string beans  
long beans and string beans look like this 
they're very long and if you can't find this  
you can also use French green beans they're 
about the same width and they also taste very  
good so that goes in a quarter cup of roasted 
peanuts wanna save a few for garnish at the end
so we're just going to break up the string beans 
so that they can then absorb the dressing better  
and also roughly breaking the peanuts some of the 
broken peanuts will become a part of the body of  
the dressing okay so that's what you look when 
that's done we're going to go in with dressing  
ingredients okay so dressing we've got first 
asset we've got about half of juicy lime that  
I'm going to add this will be an equivalent of 
about two tablespoons of lime juice let's just  
squeeze it in and then when you're done squeezing 
throw in everything the zest contains a lot of the  
aromatic oil and it will add extra flavour your 
is your not going to use it feed it but when  
you're pounding everything with it that's nice 
flavor to it okay so that's that and then now  
lime juice has a very sharp acidity we're going 
to round out that acidity with another source of  
acid tamarind juice tamarind juice it's a little 
bit sweeter a little bit well more well-rounded  
and it also adds a nice body to the dressing as 
well and I also have a tutorial video on how to  
make your own Talent juice so you can take a 
look at that if you'd like okay so that's our  
salty Nexis our sweet we're using two tablespoons 
of palm sugar syrup now palm sugar syrup I made  
myself and I keep it in a little jar like this 
a little bottle like this and it's half a cup of  
chopped palm sugar to three tablespoons of water 
now I make a syrup because this is a cold dish so  
it's going to take a long time for that hard puck 
of palm sugar to melt so it's easier this way in  
Thailand palm sugar also comes in it sort of like 
a sticky mud form so we often use that for papaya  
because it melts more easily but here I can 
only find the hard ones so I have to make a  
syrup so that goes so that's our sweet and then 
our salty I've got I think this is a tablespoon  
and a half of fish sauce now just a word about 
fish sauce keep it well sealed in the fridge  
because it does go off it won't go bad as then 
you won't get sick from it but the flavor does  
eventually deteriorate and you should be able to 
see through the bottle if it's so dark that you  
can't see through the bottle it's old okay now if 
you stop here what you've got here is some type  
or Thai style papaya salad thumb means to pound by 
the way that's our cooking technique but what I'm  
about to do is add more things and turn it into 
some Lao or a Lao style papaya salad and they like  
to add stinky stinky seafood this is fermented 
fish paste so it's basically fish that's been  
fermented with salted some rice bran and left to 
ferment it comes in a bottle like this sometimes  
in the glass jar a lot of people who make it 
at home it's called bladder or in la vehicle  
it's Monday so that goes in that's an interesting 
saltiness if you're not using that up your fish  
sauce two tablespoons because that is salty and 
then just kind of mix it up a little bit a big  
spoon comes in handy it's kind of mixed that up 
and then I'm also going to add this is completely  
optional some pickled crap so these are little 
black rafts that run around in rice patties so  
we take them and pickle them in fish sauce sugar 
and sometimes garlic and chili and all that stuff  
that looks like that this is already broken up 
sometimes you get them whole and you have to  
crush them up yourself this one's already broken 
so it's just gonna add a few and it's sweet and  
salty and the meat has been fermented so much 
that it's actually soft enough you can just  
suck it out of the legs like a straw just that 
much not too much not too much okay so to that  
I'm going to add our papaya and three quarters 
of a cup of I've got cherry tomato half you can  
use big tomatoes and you slice them up up to you 
whatever tomatoes will work and then here's the  
pounding technique if you're right-handed hold 
the big spoon in your right hand okay it'll make  
it easier the peso will pound and the spoon will 
flip the dressing from the bottom to the top so  
what you want to do is Pat it a few times and 
then I'll take a spoon and click the content  
up and the bigger the mordar the easier this is 
so my just about big enough to do this but I do  
1/4 each it'll be bigger when they sell them on 
the streets the mortars are massive and that's  
it don't overdo it once you see that everything's 
mixed up you just stop now we're going to click
now this because of the plur ah because of the 
pickled crap is specifically called some full  
bladder so if you go to Thailand you can order 
some holder okay now serve this with sticky rice  
you can serve this with Thai style barbecue 
chicken I have videos on how to do both and  
the easiest way to plate this is to hold it in 
your arm like this and just kind of drag it out  
that way it doesn't drip all over the pass 
there we go and then I'm going to take all  
the crab put it on top just so people know this 
is thumb fool and then I know a little bit of  
roasted peanuts a nice inked fur from before 
and that's it this is some thumb or thumb so  
I thought about how are whatever dialects you 
want to call it thanks for tuning in and I will  
see you next time for your next delicious 
time you and for full recipe visit oxygen
