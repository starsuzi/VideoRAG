- Do you instinctively reach
for the rubbing alcohol
when you have a sticker
that just won't come off?
Well there are so many more uses
for rubbing alcohol than just one.
Sometimes it's best to use
the stuff we've had for generations,
because new isn't always better.
Today we've compiled a list
of awesome uses for rubbing alcohol.
Some of these you may know,
while others certainly should be new.
Let's get rubbing!
Whether you use a manual
toothbrush or an electric,
You should be rinsing
off your toothbrush daily
and changing the toothbrush
or toothbrush head
every three months.
If you're a little paranoid,
and just want to ensure that
your toothbrush stays clean,
then sanitize it once per week
in a solution of rubbing alcohol-
preferably the wintergreen flavor.
It's an inexpensive method,
and you can buy it at most
pharmacies or grocery stores.
Simply pour fresh rubbing
alcohol into an empty glass
and place your brush head right in!
Let it soak for at least five minutes,
and then rinse the toothbrush
thoroughly in water
to eliminate any alcohol taste.
Just flick off the excess moisture,
and place the brush where
it can thoroughly air dry
without becoming into
contact with other brushes.
Have you ever accidentally
grabbed the wrong marker
or gotten permanent marker on something,
and then struggled to get it off?
Try using rubbing alcohol to remove
those otherwise permanent marks.
You can spray some directly on the marker,
or apply to a reusable wipe and
clean off the affected area.
It works much better if you tackle
the marker sooner rather than later.
It's especially handy when
cleaning dry erase boards.
But also very useful for getting rid
of permanent marker off walls.
As well as counter jobs, plastic bins...
Hey! A lot more.
A quick rub of the alcohol
with a microfiber cloth,
and those lingering
marks are gone for good.
We may use showers to get clean,
but without regular maintenance,
they build up quite a bit of
grime and soap scum themselves.
Try this daily shower cleaner
to ensure a squeaky clean sprinkling.
Start by measuring out 1/2
a cup of rubbing alcohol,
and using a funnel,
pour it into a 32 oz spray bottle.
Then measure out 1/2 a
cup of hydrogen peroxide
and funnel it into the bottle as well!
Grab either white vinegar
or dishwasher rinse aid
and measure 1 tsp to add it to the mix.
Finally, add 1-2 tsp of liquid dish soap.
Top off the bottle with
roughly 3 cups of water
and lightly tip the bottle back and forth,
to mix the ingredients.
After you shower,
simple mist some of the
spray onto the shower walls
and it helps to keep your shower cleaner,
with less mold or mineral build
up between deep cleanings.
No heavy duty scrubbing is needed
because the daily spray keeps things
from getting too bad during the week.
You're probably not aware,
but most commercially sold
windshield washer fluids
contain methanol,
which is not only poisonous
and potentially harmful to humans,
but it's also bad for the environment.
Make your own all weather
washer fluid instead
with just a handful of
common household ingredients.
Start by filling an empty
gallon container 3/4
of the way with water.
Add 1 tsp of liquid dish soap,
and 1/2 cup of white vinegar or ammonia.
Top it off with our featured
ingredient- rubbing alcohol.
We highly suggest adding a few
drops of blue food coloring
to serve as a reminder, or warning,
of what's inside.
Also make sure to label your mixture
and keep it out of the
reach of children and pets.
Because alcohol freezes at
a much lower temperature than water,
it can also be an effective
de-icer in cold weather.
You can pour mix into the windshield wiper
fluid reservoir of your car
and you're all set!
This cost-effective mixture contains
more natural ingredients,
and eliminates the use of methanol.
Which any way you look
at it, is beneficial.
Does someone in your household have shoes
with a lingering foul smell?
We've previously made an entire video
dedicated to stopping shoe odors.
From cat liter, to teabags,
to wood chips, to lemon peels
and baby powder!
But as you've probably guessed,
rubbing alcohol works just as well.
Last time we told you to soak
cotton balls in rubbing alcohol
and stuff them in your stinky shoes.
This time around, get rid of
that less than desirable smell
with just a few sprints
of rubbing alcohol,
and some sunshine.
Kill that odor-causing bacteria
and freshen up those stinky sneakers
by spraying the offensively-foul insides
and placing them outside
in a sunny location.
You'll be left with cleaner shoes,
or at least shoes that
are fresher than before.
Perhaps you've heard of the trick
of mixing rubbing alcohol
to top off hand sanitizer
to extend its use.
Today we've got something even better.
Commercial hand sanitizers are
often so chemically scented
that they're hard to tolerate.
There's really no need
for your nose and eyes
to burn every time you use it.
So, customize your own
and make it from home.
This recipe is naturally scented
with powerful essential oils
and a few other ingredients,
including- you've guessed it,
rubbing alcohol.
Start by measuring 6
tbsp of aloe vera gel,
and adding to a resealable bag.
Then, 2 to 3 tbsp of
72.99% rubbing alcohol.
The stronger the better in this situation.
Next, add 1 tsp of Vitamin E oil,
which helps soften hands and
is the natural preservative
to increase shelf life.
Now add 15-20 drops of
tea tree essential oil,
which is well known for it's
power antiseptic properties.
Finish with any other
antibacterial oils you prefer,
such as peppermint, rosemary,
sage, or lemon grass
to counteract the smell.
Combine all the ingredients
together and mix well.
If you prefer a thinner consistency,
you can always add a
little distilled water.
Cut a corner off the bag and squeeze
to easily transfer the hand sanitizer
into a small container.
It's perfect for throwing
in your backpack or purse.
This recipe fills a 3.4
oz travel-size bottle,
with a shelf life of up to a year!
Homemade sanitizer is that easy.
If you find yourself
cutting up onions or garlic
and want to get rid of that
potent smell from your hands,
just rub on some rubbing alcohol.
Or better yet, use some of
that homemade hand sanitizer
that you just created.
This will get rid of that smell quickly,
just be careful that you
don't have any open wounds.
That burn might be more insufferable
than the odor on your hands.
Not only do fake smelling
commercial air fresheners
never quite match their descriptions,
but you'll find that many of them
contain nasty chemicals as well.
Next time you're tempted to grab one
of those brightly colored spray cans,
grab some rubbing alcohol,
water, essential oils,
and a spray bottle instead.
Start by combining 1/2 a cup of water,
and 1/2 a cup of rubbing alcohol into
an empty 8-12 oz spray bottle.
Then, depending on how
strong you want the scent,
add 15-25 drops of essential
oils of your choice.
You should experiment to find
a mix that you really like.
We chose peppermint and lavender.
Ah, beautiful.
Give your spritzer a good
shake before you spray.
The alcohol will help the essential oils
and water mix more effectively,
and helps the all natural air
freshener evaporate faster.
Now just simply spray around
for instant freshness.
Keep in mind that just like
any other air freshener,
essential oils can be
potentially harmful to pets,
especially cats.
So keep them away from them.
Did you know that vinegar, lemon juice,
and any other asset will eat away
at your granite countertops?
Basically the harsher the cleaner,
the quicker it will
break down the sealing.
Hot water and dish soap is
adequate for daily sanitizing,
but for a stronger disinfectant,
mix together a 1:1 solution
of 91% isopropyl alcohol and water.
You can also add 5-10 drops
of your favorite essential oil
to mask the alcohol smell.
Now give it a few shakes
to mix it altogether,
and test it out.
Spray it onto the granite
and allow it to sit
for three to five minutes.
Finish by drying with a
clean microfiber cloth
to give your countertops a
beautiful, streak-free shine.
This homemade granite cleaner
works great on appliances too,
and all at a fraction of the
cost of the store bought stuff.
Got a boo-boo?
Turn kitchen sponges into
a cheap reusable ice pack
in just a few basic steps.
Start by soaking a sponge in water,
and place it in a resealable sandwich bag.
Add some rubbing alcohol
to the wet sponge.
This is gonna add a gel-like consistency
that will mold to your body better
and retain a cool temperature for longer.
Place the bag and it's
contents inside a second bag
to contain any leakage.
Place the bag inside the freezer,
and after an hour or so the mixture
should be at the right texture.
It gets really cold,
but never quite hardens,
so you can manipulate
it's shape making it ideal
for those occasional bumps and bruises.
Now obviously there's
tons of things you can do
with rubbing alcohol.
