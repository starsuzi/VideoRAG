like this to show you the correct way to
install parts from 1aauto.com the right
parts installed correctly that that's
going to save you time and money thank
you and enjoy the
video in this video we're going to show
you how to replace the rear calipers in
on this uh 2002 Trailblazer this is the
same procedure for any Trailblazer Envoy
Rainer Bravada or a sender with the
aluminum rear uh disc calipers pretty
common problem since they're made of
aluminum they tend to start leaking
after about 100,000
miles tools you'll need are Jack and
Jack Sands 19 mm socket and Ratchet or
your tire iron 11 and 14 mm wrenches and
you'll need sockets as well 10 mm wrench
brake cleaner or mineral spirits some
brake fluid and also a torque wrench and
obviously we show you how to do one side
um the opposite side is the same
procedure start by removing the rear
wheel um I am using impact uh tools so
it's a little easier just using regular
hand tools start with the vehicle on the
ground loosen the lug
then raise and secure the vehicle and
remove the lug nuts and then remove the
entire first you just want to loosen
this bolt that holds the brake line to
the
caler okay so this bolt is 11
mm got 11 mm wrench what I'm going do is
take another wrench and put it on like
that okay and just loosen it it's just a
lot easier to loosen it while you have
the caliper still
mounted and now I'm going to take my 14
mm
wrench see I
can make sure this is going to work
here and loosen up my caliper bolts
using a little wrench for EXT some extra
leverage here
fast forward here while I just remove
those two bolts that hold the caliper to
the caliper
bracket my
caliper you can see I'm leaking out a
little bit of brake fluid
already my 11 mm tighten that up little
bit okay I'm going to prep my new
caliper by taking some nice new brake
fluid okay
carefully just
fill fill the Piston okay so I've got my
new caliper right here upright and
waiting okay I'm going to take my old
caliper
remve the
line okay pair of
pliers grab hold that Crush
Washer
and all I'm doing right here is holding
the copper washer with the pliers and
then uh unscrewing the bolt to get the
washer
off
remove it pull that bolt out stick my
line up as high as I
can
okay get the other washer
off so we'll take some new copper Crush
washers on
there bring this
down
the bolt
through a new washer on
here and grab
our
caliper start the bolt
in make sure it starts straight and it
should be nice and
easy okay I'm just going to go to this
this way so that wants to come up like
that make sure we get it on here
correctly okay to better explain what I
did there I just kind of put the um
caliper down into place the way it would
be so I can make sure that the hose uh
is routed correctly and I'm tighten it
up the way it wants to be on
there got some fluid all over the place
so I'm going to pull this relatively
tight
okay try and
wipe the extra fluid
down so it's not
dripping all over the
place okay now I put this in place and
now here I'm just putting the uh bolts
that hold the caliper uh in place back
on sorry I didn't realize that my angle
was as bad as it is good shot of my back
and the 1A Auto logo
though okay so I'm going to torque my
bolts here to 23
ft-lb
and then I'm going to torque the bolt um
for the hose to uh 13 to 15
ft-lbs uh use brake parts cleaner or
mineral
spirits clean up any fluid you may have
gotten on the
rotors be sure to fill your fluid
reservoir
[Music]
now you're going to need to pump your
brakes a bunch of times to get those
rear calipers
seated you speed up a little bit and as
you can see here it takes a few pumps
before they get seated and the pedal is
firm again
okay check and fill your Reservoir again
looks
good okay now you need to bleed the
brakes the bleeder valve is right here
okay I've got a little water bottle with
a little bit of brake fluid at the
bottom I'm going to put my wrench
on and then I'm going to put this
hose right on there and then I've got an
assistant in the car and I'm going to
tell them to hit the brakes and they'll
press the brakes and then I'll loosen
this and allow any air to come out okay
so let me loosen it make sure it loosens
first okay okay hit the
brakes
hard okay you can see let off the
brakes and when you loosen the thing you
want to look in the bottle and look for
air hit the
brakes let off the
brakes hit the brakes
let off the
brakes hit the brakes one more
time let off the
brakes hit the
brakes okay let off the brakes and then
once you don't see
any once you don't see any uh
air then that's bled do the other side
and we'll be all
set okay now I'll put the tire back on
one point of clarification is if you are
going to replace both calipers you want
to replace both the calipers first and
then bleed the brakes um after you've
replaced both
calipers okay so back to the wheel put
the wheel on uh start the lug nuts by
hand first then I'm using my impact
wrench just to preliminarily tighten up
those lug nuts and then with it back
down on the ground tighten the lug nuts
with a torque wrench to 100 foot- PBS I
use a Crossing pattern doing the
opposites and then I go right around in
a circle just to make sure that they're
all tight replace the cap and you're all
set we hope this helps you out brought
