luigi the cat he kind of hopped on to
the back of finn's backpack and then
just sat there like an owl
because anything that cat did hug needed
to do the same we did the same with him
pogba went up on the backpack and just
sat there just jogging along
[Music]
we decided to go traveling with the
animals because we needed to change a
lot of things in our lives
the animals were spending a lot of time
at home while we were working
they thrived in the nature
bandito and luigi always felt most
comfortable in each other's company they
relied on each other
bandito the pug would always be the
initiator between any kind of romancing
which often turned into play fighting
they loved annoying each other
what was most surprising about their bad
behavior was around dinner time when
they would turn into complete angels
head rubbing shoulder rubs tail shakes
and the two of them would kind of team
up on finn and i and just be expected to
be waited on because they could suddenly
produce this incredibly good behavior
it was teamwork
[Music]
they were never supposed to but they
were brothers they were thick as thieves
and they adored each other
[Music]
pog was acting slightly differently to
normal and so we kept an eye on him
the next morning we
took him down to the vet because there
is a gut feeling that
bandito was not in a very good shape
he started to breathe a bit differently
and he was quite lethargic
he got so much medication that we
brought home with him
and to cut a long story short
he didn't make it through the night
it was
a massive shock for us
luigi was on the sofa
and so
he knew what had happened
as much as any cat can and as much as
humans tried to perceive emotions in
their animals luigi showed his sadness
after bandito passed away luigi was
lonesome
we decided that it was quite important
that we could distract luigi and that he
didn't feel like he was
the only animal
after about two days we saw an advert
from achakia animal rescue center his
two kittens that were five weeks old had
been left in a bin
it seemed a bit like fake we went to see
them and we came home with them
when luigi met them he was sad at the
time
but within about three days they started
to bond with each other
and within about a week they were
sleeping together they were
more than tolerating each other and a
new friendship was born really
i'd like to think that was definitely
one of the last gifts of banditos to us
because i think it looked down and
nothing could smile
[Music]
