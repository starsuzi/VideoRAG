this is going to be a lot of fun we're
going to we're going to do the painting
now here in this bathroom and it's an
awesome navy blue the ceiling is white
so I put blue tape here to create a new
line at the meeting of the
colors always prep your walls a little
bit take a
look you know wipe down any Grease I
protected this shower head but I do want
to get into this wall behind
it all right I'm happy with the wall
it's nice and smooth it's clean the
paint's going to stick again in
bathrooms we generally use a semi gloss
paint or specific bath paint uh Benjamin
Moore does have one now that is not semi
gloss it's it's more matte but it's
specifically Bath and Kitchen for mildew
resistance and being able to wash down
I'm using a mini roller it's much easier
to get into spaces like bathrooms and
paint with a mini
roller now I've also got a small size
tray and again this is a beautiful navy
blue I like to use my smaller 1 and 1/2
in Cut
brush and we'll put some paint up here
in the
corners I'm not afraid to overlap
because I've got my blue tape
I'll sometimes look back every 3 minutes
or so and just see if there wasn't a
drip or anything that I
missed smooth it
out all
right once I'm happy with my cut work
with the
brush it's time to bust out the
roller incidentally this deep blue paint
is going to take two
coats you could be on the safe side and
do
three going to go right to this bottom
Edge I'm not worried about it I've got
my blue
tape all right
so yeah the first coat is going to look
a little
thin and that's totally
fine I might let this
sit an hour an hour or two these modern
self- priming
paints they dry up pretty
quick this is a technique you might call
back rolling I already roll this area
but as it's drying I'm just rolling over
it one more time
All in One
Direction it just make sure that it's
very smooth and that dries
evenly all right so I would let this sit
an hour or two and then go ahead with my
second coat when it's solid and I'm
happy with it I would come up and
remove blue
tape exposing a new beautiful line and
there you have it you can do the
bathrooms no problem just make sure you
protect everything with plastic the tape
use a semigloss paint or a specific bath
paint for better durability and have
some fun with it you can you can go with
a deep color no problem
