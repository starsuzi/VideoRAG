welcome thank you for purchasing an Miu
France stainless steel professional
mandolin this is part one of getting to
know your
mandolin first
off your mandolin should be packaged
like so in the
Box go ahead and place these items off
to the side fold the legs up and the
bottom leg make sure it's snaap
tight
this here is the blade box which will
include your straight
blade your serrated blade and various
different size of Julian
blades the straight and serrated blade
goes to the left hand side body of the
mandolin it Glides in with the blade
facing forward or facing up and it just
snap tight like so for Julian cuts the
Julian blades are placed on the right
hand side of the body let's insert it
facing up just like
that there is a adjustment lever right
in the bottom of the mandolin which you
can pull the push for the
thickness of the cut that you
desire depending on a model of mandolin
that
purchased there is this this or this top
this one goes with our model
9767 food items such as a
potato are inserted right onto the top
here and it's held in place and then
with a forward motion
downward the cuts
made for this top which is for our model
9768 comes in two pieces you got the
Chrome top holder and a black food guide
notice the Glides on the side here it
goes onto the body of the frame like so
and it should flow straight down just
like that for our extra measure of
safety food item go into the food holder
here and you can slice it down this way
or as it gets down low
use the holder and press down and slide
down this top is spring
loaded and the spring can be
removed if you find it it's um too
springy I guess go ahead and press down
on this knob here twist this top top
comes off the assembly comes off and you
can then remove the spring and reverse
and put the top back together so you
will not have the spring loaded onto
your top there there's also the optional
black two-piece safety holder same idea
go ahead and goes on the rail this food
holder goes on
top since this unit is stainless steel
cleaning of it is very easy to remove
the blade go ahead and press your thumb
on this side for the straight blade push
in slightly and blade should be easily
removed same goes on this side there's
PL black knob there go ahead and press
your Julian blade should pop right
out you can rinse the unit or throw the
whole complete unit into the dishwasher
as is it is dishwasher safe same goes
with the um straight Julian and U Sera
blade and this is the end of part
one
