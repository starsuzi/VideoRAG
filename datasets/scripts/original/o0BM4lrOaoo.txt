Welcome to How To Cook That I am Ann Reardon.  Today we are going to make stacked pavlova which is
basically three large meringue discs with whipped cream in between them and
fresh fruit piled on the top
To start with you need to seperate your eggs.
and if you get even a little bit of egg yolk in there it won't work because egg yolk is an emulsifier so it
stops the whites from whipping up firmly.
so use that egg for something else and get another one.
For a written quantity of the recipe with all the quantities that you need just click on
the link in the description below this video to go to the website
howtocookthat.net and the recipe is there for you.
Add your sugar and the vinegar and whisk with electric mixers until it is thick enough to hold
its shape when you lift up the beaters.
Then take something round and draw three circles onto non-stick baking paper.
I used a plate that was 19cm, flip that baking paper over so that the pencil is facing down and it is 
not going to touch the food that you are cooking.
Place spoonfuls of the meringue onto that circle.
Piling ti up, and then use your spoon to make it look pretty.
It doesn't change it's shape much at all when it is in the oven so how you do it is what it is going to look like.
Try not to have any spikey bits sticking up because they tend to burn
and they don't look good. 
repeat that with your other two circles of meringue so you end up with three.
Slide it onto a baking tray and place it in a slow oven.
for about an hour
What you are trying to do is dry it out rather than cook it quickly.
While you pavlova is cooking in the oven I just wanted to take a moment to say hi and tell you it's
Australia Day today so I wanted to let you know about a few other Australian cooking channels that are on youtube.
one of them is called
mycupcakeaddiction
and she lives in Queensland and she does amazing cupcakes and cake pops 
every week, make sure you check out her rainbow pull-apart cupcake cake
because I really like that one it looks cute.
Then there is also Todd's Kitchen from Simple Easy Cooking.
and I will put a link to these channels in the description below this video so you can go check them out.
He has done licorice recipes and also fruit roll ups so there is a range of sweet goodies there that you can check out 
as well as other things
and then finally the third channel I wanted to tell you about was Jason 
over at the simple cooking channel
and he again has a range of things from smoothies made with maltesers and jelly beans
He is probably best known for his giant gummy bear video so 
if you want to know how to make a giant gummy bear 
head over and check out Jason's channel.
OK once your pavlova is ready 
don't pull it out of the oven just turn the oven off 
and leave it in there
because if you pull it out of the oven the sudden drop in heat is going to cause it to crack.
and it still might crack slightly but it is going to turn out better if you leave it in the oven to cool.
While you are waiting for it to cool slice up your fruit 
and if you are going to use banana make sure you coat that in a thin layer of lemon juice to stop the
banana going from going brown.
You can use any fruits you like, I am using blueberries, strawberries and banana on mine.
Put your cream into a bowl, now if you are in the US look for heavy cream 
If you are in Australia whipping cream, cream 
anything is fine as long as it is not light cream
Add some icing sugar and vanilla extract and
then whisk it with eletric mixers until it is smooth and thick
You don't want to over mix it because if you over mix cream it goes lumpy and you don't want that.  That is where it is starting to turn into
butter.  Just mix it until it is just thick enough 
to hold its shape.
and spoon that into a ziplock bag.
and put it to one side.
Take your tray that has your cooled meringue on it and to get it off I like to 
put it over the plate I want it on
and just slide it to the edge and pull the paper underneath so it is like pushing it off 
in one movement.
try and use a flat plate.  Because if you use a plate that has a dip in the middle you are going to make your
meringue 
sink down or crack down as soon as you put the weight of the cream on it.
Using your piping bag
pipe drop shapes of cream from the edge through into the middle.
and then put a circle of strawberry slices around the edge.
Carefully and gently 
peel your next piece of meringue off the paper 
and pop it on top and then repeat the cream and strawberries in a nice
pretty circle on top
Peel off your final piece of meringue and 
gently put it on top.
Iv'e only got a little bit of cream left over so I am just going to spread just enough
for it to be able to 
hold my stawberries in place
and put a circle of strawberry slices and then just
pile on the banana the rest of the strawberries and the blueberries
Taking a tin of passionfruit syrup 
and pour some of that over the top.
and it's ready to slice into.
If you eat it straight away the meringue will be quite chewy and crunchy.
If you leave it in the fridge for about and hour or two
the meringue in the middle goes sort of marshmallowy and on the outside it stays crunchy and crisp.
