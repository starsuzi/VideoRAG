hi guys and welcome to cooking with
Karma now this week I'm sharing with you
some recipe ideas for breakfast on
Monday I showed you how to make that
very delicious three cheese omelette and
today I'm going to show you how to make
your own toasted muley it's really quick
and simple and it's packed full of lots
of yummy goodness so I really hope you
like it let's get started and I'll show
you how to make
it first off into a bowl we're going to
add in the rolled
oats the
coconut the sunflower seeds the
pistachios and the blanched almonds then
give everything a good mix together
until it's all well
combined next to a pan on medium heat
we're going to add in the butter
the maple
syrup and the
honey then all we need to do is Stir
occasionally until the butter has
melted once our mixture is cooled
slightly we're going to pour half of
that over our nut and oat
mix give it a good
stir then we're going to add in the
remaining
liquid and then give it one final stir
until everything is well
coated then all we need to do is pour
our mixture onto a tray that's been
lined with some baking
paper then spread it out until it evenly
and thinly covers the bottom of the
tray then we're going to pop it into the
oven for 5
minutes once out of the oven we're just
going to give that a good stir around to
make sure that everything Cooks evenly
then we're going to pop that back into
the oven and repeat the process every 5
minutes for a total of 20
minutes once that's finished it should
be lovely and golden
brown and then finally we're going to
add in the dried
cranberries now as it cools it will
start to Crunch up and all you need to
do is give it the occasional stir so it
doesn't stick
together then all you need to do is pour
it into an airtight container for
storage
pop some in a bowl add in some milk and
then breakfast is
served super crunchy and packed full of
flavor it's absolutely delicious I
promise you once you make your own musy
you'll never buy the store board again
so I really hope you give it a go thanks
again for joining me have a fantastic
weekend and I'll see you all on Monday
