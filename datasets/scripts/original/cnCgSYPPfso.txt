So what are daylilies? Daylilies are probably
the flower with the most different color variations
then any other plant in perennials gardens.
As you could see they come with brilliant
colors, they come with settle colors, on this
particular one there might be 20 buds per
clump. Other you might find flowers that might
be a little bit larger with a only a few but
they all have one thing in common and that
is kind of makes me smile cause they are beautiful
flowers and they make anyone's garden look
wonderful. So why are they called daylilies?
Ever single flower that you see in front of
you right now the biggest one's, the smallest
one's, the one's with 4,5 blooms per stem
every single one of these flowers would be
dead. Cause they one last for one day. But
the great thing about it is every bud that
is about to be about open right now would
be opening tomorrow so you would have basically
the same look tomorrow. So your garden never
really changes it stays the same different
flowers may appear with 5-10 buds, you may
have your red one's, you may have your white
one 's or your pink one's. Some of them will
come earlier, some of them would stay later,
but I guarantee if you put daylilies in your
garden you would be just as happy with them
as I am.
