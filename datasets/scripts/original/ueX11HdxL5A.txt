how to change a litter box
so even though you've been scooping your
litter box daily to make sure that you
remove any solid waste and put those in
the garbage can
it's still important to change the
entire box to make sure that you have
fresh litter in there this is true
whether you have a clumping litter or a
litter that needs to be changed
regularly anyway so every week or two
weeks you should be changing the entire
litter box
so you want to get yourself a garbage
can
and this is actually a little easier to
do with the scoop
you want to be removing all
of the litter
and you'll find that there are probably
some areas that you were missing when
you were scooping
that some wet
residue had been left behind
so this gives you a chance to clean out
the entire box because there'll be
things in there that your cat can smell
that you can't necessarily smell
and this will prevent your cat from
having accidents outside the box if you
click keep this a nice hospitable
environment and then you want to use
something in there
like an enzyme cleaner this is nature's
miracle it's a product that is a natural
enzyme that just eats up the smells that
are left behind
and then you can take some paper towels
and sometimes i just let this soak for a
little bit i'm going to add a little bit
more here to cover the bottom of the
container you don't want to dilute an
enzyme cleaner you want to use it at its
full strength
and again if you'd like you can let that
sit for a little while so it has a
chance to soak up and loosen up some of
the residue that's been left on the
bottom
and then you're just going to take that
and you're going to use it to clean
the sides of the box again you just want
to leave this nice and clean for your
cat
so they find it a fresh bathroom just
like your own
and while we're talking about litter
boxes and cleaning this out here it's
important to mention that you want to
put your litter box in a place that
seems comfortable for your cat
so that doesn't mean in the washroom
right next to the washing machine
because that could be noisy and
uncomfortable for your cat and not feel
like a safe space for them to go and use
the bathroom
so providing a safe space for them where
they can enter and exit the litter box
without feeling like they're going to be
cornered by any of the other cats in the
household
and where it's not going to be a noisy
and scary experience for them
and again if we let this soak a little
bit longer we might be able to remove
those last little bits but just to show
you how this works
you want to dry it out completely so
that none of your
new litter that you're placing in there
sticks to the bottom
and you have a few different choices of
litter
most people these days use some type of
clumping litter i use a pine clumping
glitter there's also clay clumping
litter and a couple other kinds
so you can either scoop your litter in
or if you have a nice small bag here
you can just pour the litter in
and when you're adding litter to a fresh
box
you want to make sure that you're only
putting in
about two inches
because you don't want your cat to feel
like they're sinking into their bathroom
area but you do want them to have enough
that they can dig up
and cover up their area without scraping
the bottom too much
the other thing i would avoid is liners
cats don't tend to like the plastic
liners although it's convenient for us
to clean out the box by just removing an
entire liner just like a garbage bag
if a cat snags their nails on there they
might feel uncomfortable and again you
don't want to give them any reason not
to use the litter box
so i've created a nice clean surface
here for my cat and i've put it in a
safe space where they feel comfortable
using it and that's how you clean a
litter box
