in the urban and uh you can check out my
blog site at www. Rural inthe
urban.com and today we're going to be
making some sweet pickle relish I made
pickles yesterday and I had it's a
little under 6 lbs but I'm just going to
go ahead and try it um to make to make
sweet pickle relish we're using a um
cheat sheet today we're going to try
this Mrs wages sweet pickle relish just
for the heck of it I saw it in the store
and um I just figured I'd give it a
whirl I prefer Dill but it's always nice
to have sweet pickle relish in the house
because you can add it um to mayonnaise
um and make different types of sauces or
salad dressings with sweet pickle relish
or the dill relish so let's flip it over
here they cost for 6 to8 lbs of pickling
cucumbers which I have about 6 lbs half
a cup of salt 2 and 1/2 cups white
distilled vinegar most of them are %
just check the label and two cups of
sugar and this pouch of the sweet pickle
relish seasoning so I cheated and I
should have showed you
but I cut them in about 1 in
pieces that's what they recommend cuz
we're going to put these in the food
processor and um bring them down to
relish size and everybody knows what the
relish size is it's the same size when
you buy Relish in the store you want it
about that size I wouldn't exactly say
couscous which it might end up being the
couscous size but um we're going to go
ahead and give us give it a
whirl okay I brought the Cucumbers over
to the food processor I'm going to go
ahead and put some in the food
processor that's about enough and then
we'll go from there going to go ahead
and put the top
on oops
that all right we're going to pull this
and try to get it to um the size we
want and you also want to get in there
and
um think I need a new one it's getting
old scrape down the sides a bit cuz you
want to make
sure the Cucumbers end up in um
Universal
size all right P this
again cuz you know want to be mush
either take this one out maybe I added a
little bit too much little bit more you
can see this is really wet cucumbers are
mostly um made up of
water oops break
this
H taking a little bit longer than I
expected but this is the realities
of r
relish it's called the relish
realities oh I do need a
new this one's so old but hey it still
works now we're going to go ahead see
what the size that is yeah some of it's
a little bigger than but it's a good
size right here not sure if you can see
it's not going to be like the store
bought 100% but I'm going to go ahead
and scrape this into the bowl that I
have over here and I'm going to do that
with the rest of the cucumbers
okay all the cucumbers are in
approximately 1/8 size pieces I mean
some might be bigger some might be a
little bit smaller but um I did the best
I could with the food processor now
you're going to take that half a cup of
salt which seems like an awful lot and
you're going to sprinkle it over the
cucumbers and you're going to stir the
salt in this is just going to extract
more of the water that's in the
cucumber and what you're going to do
you're going to cover this after you
stir it in and let it sit for 2 hours
then after that 2 hours you're going to
um drain it in a fine mesh colander okay
see you in 2
hours okay it's been 2 hours since the
cucumbers have been sitting with the
salt um pulling the water out of the
Cucumbers the next step is we're just
going to pour it into a fine seeve um
colender and I'm not sure if you can see
that and get the rest of this out I you
see that look at that that's just like
pouring out of there so what I'm going
to do is take the rest of it out of this
stainless steel
bowl I want any of it to go to
waste smells good I can smell the salt
and the Cucumbers it's one of my
favorite snacks actually salted
cucumbers put that to the side we'll
wash that and probably to speed up this
process I could probably sit here and
press
it but I'm not in any hurry so I'm just
going to let this drain naturally and
then I'll be back to
um press out some of the liquid which
you can just take it up to the sides
like that take the cucumbers and just
press try not to overflow it like I
almost did there and um that'll
expedite you finishing this
recipe okay
just stay tuned for the next step okay
the cucumbers have
drained and to a stock pot this probably
about a 4 quart stock pot I'm going to
add the 2 and 1/2 cups of white
distilled
vinegar I'm going to go ahead and add
the two cups of
sugar and I'm going to add the packet of
seasoning
grabb a spatula we're going to give it a
[Music]
stir
okay um we're going to turn the heat
on and we're going to bring this mixture
to a
boil after it comes to a boil you're
going to turn it down to medium heat and
then you're going to Zimmer it for 10
minutes on covered stirring
occasionally until it boils you're going
to stir constantly cuz you don't want
that sugar to burn on the
bottom forgot a step when this comes to
a boil you're going to go ahead and add
the drained cucumbers then simmer that
for 10
minutes okay it's coming up to a boil so
what you're going to do next is add the
cucumbers
drain cucumbers just be careful when you
get put this in I'm just going to spoon
it in so I don't want it to drop and
then splash all over cuz that liquid
will be
[Music]
hot there we
are now you can tell by that mix cuz
I've been uh looking at it looks like
there's some red pepper in there you can
see the celery seeds you can see the
mustard seeds and you can tell that
there's xanthan gum in there because it
uh holds um the particles in
place okay I'm going to go ahead and
stir this in turn the heat down and
we're going to simmer it for 10
minutes let's get this in
here looks good
already it's starting to take on that
relish goodness look at that let me get
a closeup of that it thickened up and um
it rehydrated all
the herbs and spices and everything else
that was in that
packet
so in the um saucepan behind
it I have the
lids that
are soaking in hot water I got a hot
water bath right here that's ready to go
let me turn it down a bit cuz it looks
like it's boiling and I have my it makes
five pints but I'm going to put it in
half pint jars because
um when you use relish and stuff in my
eyes you don't use a lot of
it like I go through spurts and I might
hand this out at gifts I'm going to make
up baskets for Christmas and hand it out
as gifts so I'm going to go ahead and
use the half
PLS so let's go over here
here we're going to let me go back a bit
there we go we're going to fill up these
jars right over to the right so I have a
stainless steel
funnel the jars are not they're clean I
wouldn't say sterilized but they're
clean so what I'm going to do is go
ahead and ladle this
in and it said you're going to you're
going to leave a half of inch of head
space so just go ahead
these all up
here oops that one's way over full
oopsies me grab a
spoon there we
go all right get the next
jar and I'll be back when we're done
with that okay I filled up all the jars
there's approximately nine half pint
jars and I purchased my new handy dandy
tool at a big box store yesterday so I
usually don't go shopping that much but
it has the measuring devices and then
you this is you go around the edges so
each one of these jars you want to take
this plastic end just don't use metallic
they say always use plastic or wood to
go around to make sure there's no air
bubbles okay with a new handy dandy
measuring tool you're going to make
sure there's a half inch half of half an
inch of head space which there is is so
I'm going to put that to the
side then on each one of these jars
you're going to go around the outside
with a paper towel to make sure there's
no debris on the
rim just go like that it's wiped then
you're going to take
your lid magnetic lid
lifter and you're going to put a lid on
each one of these
jars see if I can quickly do
that woo hot hot
hot just don't do what I do at
home do as I say not as I
do there we go almost done
here all right all the lids are on
you're going to take a ring put it on oh
that's hot little hot take a tellw so
you don't burn yourself and put them on
fingertight okay and then from
here you're going to take your jar
lifters
and put it into
the hot water bath which is right here
and I'll show you once again that's hot
be careful take your lid off watch out
for the steam we're boiling boiling a
little which I really didn't want
to and you're going to put your
jars right in the water like that
oopsies there we go and I'll go ahead
and put this other one in just so you
can
see there we go okay you're going to go
ahead and add all these jars to that hot
water bath and you're going to process
these jars at once it comes to a full
rolling boil you're going to process
them for 15
minutes okay 15 minutes has passed
they've processed for 15 minutes so I'm
going to remove them from the water bath
caner and put them on a
towel on the counter I'm putting mine on
a sheet pan so I can move them someplace
else because we have other things to can
[Music]
oops there we go just want you to see
this see nice closeup it looks perfect
it looks like relish so um the package
did say to let it age for one
day I usually let my canned goods um age
for a couple weeks before I try
them um that way all the flavors melt it
taste
