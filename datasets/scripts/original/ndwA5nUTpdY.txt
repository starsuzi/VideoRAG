i'm sandi folsom i'm the director of the
wilton school with beth summers who is
teaching the introduction to fondant
class it is a supplemental class that
follows the master's course on three
afternoons however it is not necessary
to sign up for the master's course to be
in this course beth what medium are you
using well in introduction to rolled
fondant we work all with rolled fondant
enrolled fondant is just a really tasty
icing that you can roll and cover a cake
with or do lots of fantastic decorations
with and because it conforms to any k
any shape it makes cake decorating
really fun and simple that sounds like
fun what techniques will you be showing
you'll learn how to crimp cakes
do swags and things like that make all
kinds of 3d decorations several kinds of
flowers and leaves bows to make cakes
look like packages or presents we'll
emboss cakes imprint cakes do lots of
things for texture really a ton of great
things in this class and you can do them
all
i'm going to show you how to do a quick
rope it's very simple and it's a great
way to finish the base of a cake and i'm
just going to use two different colors
of fondant to show you the difference
would you hold that for me sandra thank
you
and it's as easy as just kneading it a
little bit to get it ready
and then rolling it into a log
just like that
it came a little bit
a little bit it's a little bit pliable
i've worked a little bit of shortening
in
just like that and i'm going to take my
second color and do the same thing
work it with my hands a little bit and
get it
just like that
and when they're about the same
thickness and you can definitely do this
thinner
you'll just take them and twist them
together
to have a great braid a rope i'm sorry
and then you could use this at the base
of a cake or the top of a cake or any
any nautical themed cake this is really
nice decoration
what else can the students expect to
learn well you'll definitely learn how
to cover a cake with rolled fondant
which is the for the most important
thing you'll learn the feel of rolled
fondant which is very similar to
modeling clay you'll learn how to
make the flowers as we mentioned all
kinds of molds
the bows ribbons etc we'll color the
fondant you're going to learn a lot of
different things and at the end of the
class you get to take home the sample
cake that has all of the different
things that you've learned on it so you
can refer back to it and remember all of
the techniques that sounds like fun beth
i'm sure students will want to sign up
for this course whether it's while
they're taking the master's course or if
they just want to come to attend
the introduction to fondant class we'd
love to see you
