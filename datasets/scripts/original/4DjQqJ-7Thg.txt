in 1953 there were 26 days over 100° and
today we're expected to beat that record
with 27 days over 100° in
2011 so to celebrate we're baking
cookies in the backseat of my
car we've got the cookies they're all
laid out in the window ready to bake and
this is a temperature gauge and it
says that right now it is 150° in my car
and that's with the door open earlier
when we opened it it was
190° we have no idea if this is going to
work but let's check back in about 20
minutes and see what we
have it has been 20 minutes so we're
going to check the temperature real fast
I'm going to open the door really
quickly and check
it oh it is 29° in
there woo that's hot this is what they
look like after about an hour of baking
in the back seat not much has changed
but they do look a little crispier than
our last
visit I think they're
baking
I
know okay this is crazy these are
actually baking it's nuts like they
really look like they're
done all right I think we have to try
them we definitely have to open this up
and at least test a few out this car has
been shut for 2 hours now so I'm going
to open the door and I'm going to check
the temperature and then I'm going to
pull one of these out we're going to try
it
so
160 all right this is
hot
okay now this checks the surface
temperature so the surface temperature
of this cookie is
176°
ready that's hot oh my gosh this is
unbelievable I cannot believe this
actually worked look at it it's a cookie
and it's a hot
cookie that's a good
cookie
