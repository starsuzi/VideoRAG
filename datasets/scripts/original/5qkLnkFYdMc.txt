all right guys and gals thanks for
taking some time out to check back on
our third video on the day lily seeds
here and what we're going to do is we're
going to open up the bag we're going to
get right to
it and see what we got going on inside
there today is April
21st
2014 so you can see 11 days later
what we're going to have
here look this
guy he's ready to be
planted there he's got some green coming
up he needs
planted another one a good
one
we got all six this one's starting to
come
out so we had six seeds to start
with and we've got six seeds growing
now there's the last one our runt we
were calling that the
runt so here we
are got uh 1 2 3 4 5 six there's our
last one he's
slow but um I would
say you know you could plant all these
except for this one I really don't like
to plant the seeds until I see the
green the green coming out you can see
how long the rout is know the Root's
about an inch
long on five of the
six so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to leave these couple in for a few more
days I'm going to plant these two right
now they got the green coming out so and
that's what we
do so there you go guys there it is 6
