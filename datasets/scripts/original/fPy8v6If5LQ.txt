hey guys this is Joyce with another
tutorial on how to make apple crumble
for the Apple Cinnamon filling you will
need 4 apples 1 tablespoon of flour and
1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
remember these ingredients are according
to your taste

the ground cinnamon into the brown sugar

as a twistier apple crumble
now finally placing the combo on top of
the pads
in their oven it goes for 15 to 20
minutes now that your apple crumble is
in the oven prepare to play I like to
serve mine straight out of the oven with
a bit of ice cream
you could also microwave it when it's
cold you could also place it back in the
oven for 5 minutes to keep that extra
crunchiness of the caramel
