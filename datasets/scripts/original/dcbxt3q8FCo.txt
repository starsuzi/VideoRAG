Hello friends!
Today i am going to give you an update 
about my tomato sucker and its current status
It is now on flowering and starts blooming
and this is growing purely in water
You can see the roots are healthy now
and now i am thinking to transfer in hydroponic system
As you can see, its a huge plant
and it was a healthy tomato sucker
at the time of pruning
It was supported with a seedling tray
So these are my clay pebbles
and this is my old plastic glass with holes
I am going to make more big holes in it
and will insert clay pebbles
I am going to cut the sides with knife
and then i will transplant it in my hydroponic nutrient
Let me cut it with the knife
and then i will update you
So this is what it looks like now
First, I tried cutting it with a simple knife but no success
but cutting it with a hot knife worked
and this is my sucker
Now check out its roots
It is doing great
Now i am going to transplant it
As i have told you before that simply put it like this
Try to take out some roots from the center of a glass
Now it is stuck
Now hold the stem and insert big clay pebbles in glass
and now add more clay pebbles in the glass
let me fill the glass then i will update you
Now as you see
 i have filled the glass with clay pebbles
and fit it completely
Now I am going to place the glass on top of the bucket
I ready this bucket for hydroponic system
As you can see some of the roots are coming out
Basically, I am using a Kratky Sstem for this
Wait a second, i will show you
I might have a problem
because I don't have the right glass size
but it will be well sinked in the water
that's fine, that's cool
As you can see it is pretty settled now
Don't worry about the glass if it's sticking out a bit
So this is my tomato sucker
which i have pruned it from my tomato plant
it developed a lots of root
Now i have transplant this in Hydroponic Kratky Sytem
will show you its update more
It has small buds when i put in water
yet were bloomed in the same water
When buds starts blooming then 
just tap the shoots lightly
to prevent the flowers drop problem
and flowers will turned into fruits
Ok then, i will soon update you more
this is Hydroponic Kratky Method
Ok then, will meet you with the next update
Thank you so much
please take good care of yourself
Stay blessed!
