okay so here we are with an authentic uh
herv leisure dress
um when you receive your dress it will
come with this label on it
which basically says that once the label
is removed you can't return the item the
basic idea behind this is to stop people
from buying
these dresses online wearing them once
and then return them for a refund
so of course if you do want to wear your
dress more than once and
you don't want to wear it with the lady
you have to take the label off which
actually is a little bit scary because
when you
when you get this thing the label feels
really secure
and you can see the stitching here and
basically some people have tried
actually unstitching
the label not to take it off in order to
avoid
damaging the dress but actually you
really need to do exactly what it says
which is to tear here
so all you're going to do is you're
going to start with the label here take
a nice firm grip and you've got to tear
it quickly
and use a fair amount of case so
actually the moment of truth is right
here let's have a go
okay so there you go so actually you can
see here the label has torn off
absolutely perfectly
the um the edge there is really good and
look
no damage whatsoever to your dress so
that's how to remove label from a herb
versus dress
