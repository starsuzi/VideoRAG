Hey it's Richard here with Platinum Pond & Lake Management. 
Here today I wanted to show you some marginals that are great to
have around your farm pond or retention pond. Marginal plants are non invasive
plants like you see here.
Some Irises and these Irises key compete
against
more notches plants which would be kin
here to another marginal that
actually blows and that's the cattails. 
The toughs that are on top that will tend to pop off 
and drift everywhere around the pond.
Irises do not do that
we love Irises because you can see
here there's nothing competing with the
Iris. The Iris 
basically chokes everything out. Here
we are protecting your ground and the
area
beneath the cypress tree. Basically we planted some swaths 
usually in about 15 to 20 feet swaths.
These areas are planted and then they can repropogated throughout your property.
Makes it a lot easier on mowing, keeps the grass clipping out 
and as you can see here protects
something that's very valuable thats been
basically planted from the seedling. 
A little up close view here you can actually see the cypress knees that are coming out of the ground that are
used
for getting oxygen since the trees
mainly underwater it 
uses these knees to pop up.  Then look
you can I look a little closer
you can actually see signs of beaver and as we go back  to the trunk of the tree you can 
actually see teeth marks as they start to widdle 
on this tree. Up on this side here and as well as a few bite marks in here. 
This is really when you want to get protection
back up around your tree. 
This tree is about 12 inches in circumference or across the diameter of it
and this protection
device has actually fallen off because it has been too hard. 
Make sure you check those on a yearly basis and take care of your pond.
As always find us on the web at platinumlakes.com. We would love to hear from you in the 
Charlotte,
