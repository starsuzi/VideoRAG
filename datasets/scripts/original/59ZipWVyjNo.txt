this chris the idol painter this is part
three
on my series of how to epoxy your own
garage floor so stay tuned
as we begin the actual application
process
of epoxy in your floor and we're getting
ready to
do the epoxy process and we've got to
mix our two parts of epoxy and let them
sweat
a process of allowing them to activate
before we begin applying it on the floor
prior to this third video i got my first
video on acid etching and power washing
the floor
and then the second video which is
caulking all the cracks and getting it
ready to epoxy
and now we're on this third part um part
three of our video series a pocket in
the garage floor
so stay tuned to mixing up the epoxy and
we're gonna show you that process so i'm
now ready here
to mix my epoxy together and
the epoxy we use is a two-part
industrial epoxy and you're going to
have
a part a and a part b this is part b and
then
we've got a part a right here
and part a is actually the color itself
and
we're gonna take and mix um there's a
label covering the a
but that's just um there's two there's
four together right here
part a part b part a part b and then we
also got
a thinner right here on our first coat
of epoxy we thin
our first coat that makes it absorbent
into the concrete a lot better
we've got a measuring cup right here to
measure out our thinner
which is a reducer 54 too thin or epoxy
i've got some rubber gloves because i
don't want to get the stuff on my hands
i've got just a throwaway brush that i
can scrape out my
gallon cans i've got a way that i can
actually mix it
and then i've got a lid to put on my
five gallon bucket while it's sweating
and the sweating process is actually
mixing part a and part b together
and allowing it to sit and activate and
you want to take and read the
instructions on your
your epoxy your two-part epoxy and make
sure you allow it to sweat the proper
amount of time
so you get the the hardness out of the
epoxy coat before
it uh or accurate after it dries
so now i'm going to show you this part
of mixing these two together
and then we're gonna go apply it on our
floor
so we got part b right here and this is
the clear one
just dumping this in here
if you want to see my previous videos
part one and part two
of my video series at the end of this
video i'll have them posted where you
can just click on the video and go back
and watch
parts one and two and i got my
throwaway brush right here this is just
to scrape out everything out of these
gallons
to get everything out of them because
this stuff is really expensive
and i don't want any to go to waste
[Music]
now i'm going to begin adding my
thinning compound which is reducer 54
and i like to uh typically reduce it
about 10 percent
and what i'm gonna do is i got uh
four gallons in here which is two kits
of epoxy and i'm gonna add in
what i like to do is typically add in
two pints of reducer 54
and that's gonna make it thin enough to
absorb a little bit better into your
concrete
on your first coat
on your second coat i don't add any
thinner
or reduce my epoxy at all
i'm gonna begin mixing it up with my
grill got a drill with a mixer right
here
and then once i got it all mixed i'm
going to check the time
and then per my instructions i want to
make sure it sweats for at least that
amount of time
right now it's two o'clock so i'm gonna
wait until it's time before i start
applying my epoxy
don't forget during my videos anytime
all the tools and necessities we're
using
to do our floors or our paint jobs can
be purchased right on my amazon tool
store
anytime you see the logo right there
that's the link to my amazon tool store
you can buy simple little things like a
five in one
or other fancy tools that i have even an
airless sprayer so go check it out
anytime you
see that link you can just click on it
it'll take you right to my website which
has my amazon tool store
okay now here we are i got a garage
floor we got our product all
sweating and which is the actual process
of mixing up the amb
of our two part epoxy and the sweating
is the activating of those two parts
and our epoxy that we're actually using
it takes a half hour sweat time
so it's been that half hour now we're
going to begin on our floor begin
rolling it on our floor
but prior to that we want to blow out
any dust or debris that's
on our floor scrape off anything walk
around the floor really
and look really closely at the floor
make sure there's no glue or anything
on the floor there's a lot of times on
your garage floors there's carpet glue
and new construction when they're doing
the carpet so check for any glue any
caulking
or anything on the floor that you don't
want to epoxy over and scrape it off
and then blow this thing out really good
and then we've got to actually chalk a
line where our garage doors go down
because we don't want the garage doors
to set on top of the epoxy
so you want to determine where your
garage doors are chalk a line
run some tape inch and a half tape and
that will make a nice line where your
epoxy will be
and we're going to begin that process
right now
[Music]
so now we got our line chalk we got it
masked off to make a nice
crisp line where the garage doors go
down we're going to begin
rolling the epoxy and i like to have two
people i like to have one person doing
all the cut ends
and footings around the edges and then
another person rolling
and i'll be rolling and i like using
just a
nine inch roller with a mohair nap and
it's just
a little thin nap and that's what i like
to use when i'm applying my epoxy
the person doing the cut ends is just
using a four inch nap with a brush just
throw away tools that way when we're
done with the epoxy we just throw away
all the tools even your nine inch roller
it's gonna get epoxy all over it
and it's pretty much gonna ruin the
roller so don't use anything expensive
because we just throw it all away
so here we go so we're gonna be starting
in this far corner
i've got johnny's gonna be doing the cut
ends it's a good idea to have some
rubber gloves you'll get this epoxy on
your hands and it's really nasty stuff
you don't want to have to clean it off
with chemicals so get yourself a box of
throwaway gloves or just some
some rubber gloves that once you get it
on it that you can throw those gloves
away too
[Applause]
then you have an extension pole long
enough i like
i like to use an extension pole about
this size
because you're going to be rolling
square to square and laying it out so
you need an extension pole that's going
to reach far enough so you can do your
[Music]
layout
[Music]
[Music]
so here's a few tips we're just working
right along on this floor
and john's doing all the cut-ins and i'm
doing the rolling
in the first coat what i'm trying to do
is just roll and put enough pressure
because i want
to actually push that epoxy down into
the pores of the concrete
and get a really good seal and a really
good bite so i'm putting a lot of
pressure
i'm not worried about laying my first
coat out my second coat is going to be
really important to lay it out to get
your brush
or your roller strokes looking really
nice and get a good
nice layout on it but the first coat the
important part
is just pushing hard enough and getting
enough pressure
and you don't want a really thick layer
you want a nice thin layer that's going
to absorb into the concrete really well
and then when i'm rolling i always keep
my
roller uh the point of my roller face to
my left side as i'm rolling
and that way the actual um
the roller cover itself won't come off
your roller
cage so i always keep it pointed to the
left and that's just
kind of a little simple little trick
[Music]
there
[Music]
another tip here is i'm just working
right out of a five gallon bucket
i don't have to screen it or anything
but all
all my parts were just mixed into a five
gallon just dipping it in
to that five gallon bucket and like
blowing it out and i just slide my
bucket right along
the concrete with my extension pole when
i need to
so
so
[Applause]
[Music]
so
[Music]
another good tip is if you're actually
doing this epoxy floor for a customer
you need to close the garage doors not
all the way but down
a certain amount so you want to make
sure that garage door if you don't have
access to the house
that you can actually close the garage
door so you either have the code
but it's better to have it not where it
goes down
with the code but just pull the little
um release lever so you can just slide
the garage door
let it get down and set on top of a one
gallon bucket
or so so make sure that you have access
to get out we just work our way out
and then grab the garage door and just
lower it lightly and set it on a one
gallon bucket
sells it
so cruising right along here we've got
just this back end now we're working our
way out the garage
one thing is it's a good idea i've got
an actual gallon of reducer 54 just
sitting right out here in case something
goes wrong
you need to clean the epoxy make sure
you don't have any on your shoes as we
work our way out we're going to take our
shoes off
in case we have any epoxy on our shoes
and then we'll be just working in our
socks as we work our way out the garage
because what you don't want to do is
track any epoxy on the driveway out
there because
it's a absolute nightmare to try to get
it off
and if you do you want to make sure you
have the proper thinning
product and the the product that we use
towel fat high solids it's reduced with
reducer 54.
[Music]
so i got my last square here i'm rolling
gonna be working my way
right off the garage with our last
square here
just make sure that you don't have any
epoxy
on your shoes as you work your way out
the garage
now i'm working my way out here i got to
set my bucket we're just going to set a
drop cloth
right here on the concrete to set the
bucket on
because the bucket could have epoxy on
it that you don't want to get
on the concrete either
[Music]
so there you have it we got it all
complete now all rolled out we're just
gonna pull our tape
put all the rest of the epoxy in that
five gallon bucket all the tools are
just trash put them in the bucket let
them dry out and then we'll throw them
away
we're gonna lower this garage door down
at the end of the day you want to keep
it up so
all these fumes will just be well
ventilated and there you have it that's
the first coat of epoxy now stay tuned
for the next part
and this will be part four applying the
second coat of epoxy
and then on this garage we're actually
gonna be applying some flex
and so with some color flex that add a
lot of color to it they got three
different colors and we spreading out
these color
flecks and then adding a clear coat to
that that will be the fifth
the fifth part of my epoxy series so now
you can check out if you haven't seen
part one and two i'll have them right up
here on both sides of my video where you
can click on watch part one and part two
well that's it for part three applying
the first code of epoxy
now click on the video right up here and
i'll teach you how to apply the second
coat of epoxy
