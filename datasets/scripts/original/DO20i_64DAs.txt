I have an
idea what do you think my idea
is
really
mm I think she's getting the
[Music]
idea even though babies with few teeth
can't enjoy whole fruits like these
beautiful red raspberries there's no
reason they can't have homemade baby
food like this raspberry banana baby
food puree it's so sweet and creamy and
has the most beautiful red color so to
start we've got what is this Chloe ban
banana and it's got tons of potassium
and it's really sweet and creamy can you
pull that
back
yeah and I just got this baby Bullet so
I'm really excited to give it a whirl so
you just take one banana that's all you
need one whole
banana and you're going to put it into
this little cup here and then I've got
half a cup of red
raspberries do you want one of the
raspberries right now yeah you want
one and what's easy about this is it's
only two ingredients so your baby can
enjoy I'm going to smash it in this is a
first food and have the opportunity to
taste something that is really beautiful
sweet hasn't been sitting on a GL
grocery store store shelf for weeks or
even months you're making something
that's homemade that can freeze
easily okay and raspberries are great
cuz they're packed
with with um What vitamin C antioxidants
what else the raspberries have dietary
fiber so this is an amazing baby food
all right ready 1 2 3
and that's it and the best part is you
get your baby involved from day one
you've got your baby cooking with you
making food enjoying it what do you
think Chloe does this look like it's
going to be pretty good what color is
that pink beautiful pink it's like you

Chloe is almost too but you could put
this on yogurt mommy could put it on ice
cream m
