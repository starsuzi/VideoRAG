so I thought I'd do a video of this
insect hotel which I wanted to make for
some time finally got around to doing
it um this is going to be uh hopefully
beneficial to solitary bees and maybe
bumblebees but lace
wings
um
invertebrates and who knows what else
spiders definitely garden spiders
and hopefully mainly like solitary bees
because uh there was his suffering along
with the honey bee who knows it's it's
almost 3/4s done really but I thought
I'd take you up to where I am now and
then maybe do a second video when it's
up on the fence cuz this is horizontal
at the moment but it's going to be
vertical with the bottom being
here um you've basically got old fencing
the whole thing is recycled wood
including the posts the Moss is from the
garden the branches here are old
branches that have fallen from the woods
and the bamboo I used to use for runner
beans but recycling it
here the uh the slats are going to be
for lace wings that's old weatherboard
from
fencing with gaps made up small bits of
wood so hopefully they'll hibernate in
there the Moss like I say is from the
garden and not sure exactly what's going
to use it but I've read somewhere that
it's uh it's going to be beneficial to
certain things maybe birds will take it
but they'll nest with it and if they do
good for them the bamboo here solitary
bees along with the wood
really and this thing here I no idea I
came up with this I'm not sure what's
going to use spiders will definitely use
it but I'm not sure if anything else is
going to be using it smaller Twigs that
I had after cutting the branches up and
I've bent larger Twigs in just to hold
it in place not sure what I'm going to
put in the other two sections yet but
the outside will be drilled uh three
different sizes of uh hole again for
solitary bees and then it'll be uh put
on the fence and I'll have a cap on the
top with some felt stop it getting too
wet I don't have a great deal of luck
with solitary bee or in this case
bumblebee enclosures this is one I made
actually got five of these which I've
just taken out of the ground because I'm
going to relocate them but if you do
want a design for good bumblebee
enclosure it's basically a pot
um with a mesh cage at the bottom with a
notch cut out and some moss on it the
that fits in there I was using copper
pipe cuz hoping it would stop the Slugs
going in as soon as I didn't have any
slugs or bees they definitely need
relocating but when they when I put them
in the ground which is going to be much
better than this gravel which is what
they were in I will use a bit of plastic
pipe and bend it underneath and then out
of the ground with a CO hole in the
bottom for drainage for when the when
the water rains into the end of the pipe
on the top I drilled a hole
inside actually these come with a hole
anyway and got a
small um pot here tiny little pot cut
the lip off cut them in half wasted a
half of the ones I cut but um eventually
I got The Knack of doing that glued them
in place along with a mesh here so it
events it inside and the rain can rain
on there and then come out a notot which
I cut here I'm going off the subject a
bit but that's uh ones I tried last year
which weren't very successful this year
the I've tried one in here got a
removable flap
here uh hopefully they will land on the
hole go into this uh entry chamber here
there's a hole cut into the back here
and they'll go through into this section
here but who knows it's very hard if I
take you up the pond two Wildlife ponds
up here all this wood was from Southern
fencing who kindly uh gave me uh wood
they usually incinerate but it's going
to waste so why not use
it I'll take you up to The Ponds I'll
show you the other things I have for
solitary bees which do
work which
uh are
these fence posts with holes cut in you
can see the solry bees they they go in
and lay their l or whatever they do
and then they seal the entrance with
Leaf cut precisely the entry you can see
these are last years where they've come
out there's these two here are this
year's I've got a few of those on the
fence and they're awesome they do work
that is a
bumblebee nest and I've got mice in it
like I say really hard to get
them to go anywhere near it but he is
hoping I do have a lot of bees here A
whole Gard is
designed to attract insects got a
wildlife a wild flower garden here which
is on its way in awful year so far but
hopefully that will come
up so that concludes this video
hopefully on the next one I'll have all
the holes
drilled and I'll be putting it on the
fence and I'll uh I'll show you it
completed
