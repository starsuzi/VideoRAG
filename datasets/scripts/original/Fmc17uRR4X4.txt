Circular saws can be scary, and make a mess.
Never fear, Bullet Tools wants you to Shear.
It's the fastest way to cut laminate flooring.
No Dust, no noise, no electricity. Line up
the board, set it to a 90 or 45 degree angle
and drop the handle for a clean cut. Without
sawdust, there's no need for the back and
forth. With this there allowed to just stay
on the job sight, they mark their board, they
turn around and cut it. No more extra protective
gear either. There is no moving blade, just
a super sharp fixed blade that drives right
threw the product, one pass. And the amount
of effort needed, less than I expected.
