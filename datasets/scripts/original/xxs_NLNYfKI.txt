okay guys so here's something really
cool I want to show you
today this is the top um from the
beachroad it's just the very very top
that we cut off and uh put we put in a
little bit of water like this and grew
this these amazing little sprouts and we
didn't put anything in the water so all
they grew these Sprouts grew up from
where just was just water and and
Sun so I mean as you can see there's
almost
nothing from the beach
Ro remains so um yeah I think this
is an amazing source of energy because
it's it's it's as pure as it can get
it's just water and Sun so yeah really
small super healthy try at home
