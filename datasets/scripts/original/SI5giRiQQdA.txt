hello YouTubers today I'm going to show
you how to reverse the process of a
plastic G yellow as you can see this is
slightly yellow a little bit but you can
see it really well under a fluorescent
light just like this so if you see a
little bit of lines on the screen that's
just from the florescent lighting so
what you're going to use use to reverse
the process of this plastic is this
Salon care 40 cream you can buy this at
Sally's you can get a big bottle of this
stuff for cheap if you're if you have a
bunch of stuff from back in the days
that the plastic turned yellow this is
from
1998 this seem a smoke detector but what
I'm going to do is I'm not going to do
this head but I'm going to do this
base because I'm planning on buying a
new smoke detector head from eBay a
different model of this
head but a newer one and it's white and
then this base is
yellow so what you're basically going to
do is you could rub this stuff on the
base but wear gloves cuz if you don't
wear gloves with this stuff it'll strip
the color out of your skin and you'll be
freaking out just like I did a year
ago and then what you do after that is
close a zip lock I prefer using zip
loocks to hold in all the
moisture and I'm going to stick it
outside for 3 Days 3 or 4 days and I
want to see how white this gets cuz I
did this a year ago and it worked really
well but I want to see how white this
can get in 3 days from being
outside and yes you have to put this
outside or you could put it under a
black light maybe in some cases a
florescent tube light like this more
like old
t12's because they released the UV
ray UV rays make make the plastic yellow
just by itself but this stuff will
reverse it and make it turn white which
is pretty amazing and get the 40 not
anything below that cuz it won't
work so
here I'm going to stick it in the zip
block I'm not going to rub it so what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna pour some
of this stuff in here and then shake it
around in the zip log and make sure it's
sealed so and I'm goingon to do a little
comparison with this base in this head
with
color so I'm going to pour some of this
on this base but I'm going to shake the
stuff first because I'm I haven't using
this stuff in a year give this stuff a
little Shake if you have this laying
around your house if you get it at the
store you don't have to shake
it just shake it like
that and you just take the top
off remember don't touch this stuff with
your bare skin it won't be good for you
you'll be freaking out
so so see how much of it I got in there
that's a good amount I know it's a
little too much but I'm going to rub it
around in there I'm going to shake the
bag if those fire alarm collectors if
you have a system sensor Spectra alert
this will also work with that as well
because I have remember those two system
sensor spectral alerts those were so
yellow that I wanted to try the this
experiment on those two but take out all
the electronics take the board
out and just leave the enclosure itself
leave the enclosure open it won't harm
the
sticker or the label that says fire on
it so it will work with that as well but
make sure that there's no electronics in
there so now what I'm doing is I'm going
to get this stuff everywhere
I'm going to get the salon care 40 cream
everywhere in the zip
block make sure it's everywhere make
sure to get it all on that piece of
plastic that you want to
[Applause]
restore and it shouldn't harm the
metal and this is the best time to do
this is in the summertime like in my
case I live in Arizona and it's really
hot this is the best time to do this
this because there's a lot of UV rays in
the summertime you know work in other
places too that are really hot like that
reach the '90s or and
above in the winter time I would not
recommend doing this save this for the
summer if you're going to plan on doing
this make sure to do it when it's really
hot like in the summertime or late
spring so like maybe start at maybe late
March and those states where it's really
hot you can start doing
this
but like maybe early September or
October it's starting too late to do
this because that's when the weather
starts to cool down in some states I
recommend doing this just in the summer
like right now it's May so this is a
perfect time I did my my experiment last
year with this in June in mid June
so
see this stuff's soaked everywhere on
this so I'll put this outside I'll get
back to you when I'm putting this
outside okay so now I'm outside so this
is a spot I chose to put this base on
top of my
shed make sure to choose a spot where
there's a lot of sunlight all day pretty
much like in my case starting maybe like
at 900 in the morning it's sunny right
here the Sun starts shining here and
it's it's all sunny here all
day till goes out in the west over there
so make sure you choose a good spot
where there's a lot of UV rays to
reverse the process and I'll be back
with you in a few days to see the
results of this okay YouTubers so this
is a couple days later I decided to do
this head as
well look at the
difference
before after
this is what the salon care 40 so how I
get the how I remove this stuff is I go
to a my kitchen sink I don't use the
sponge I use a Old
Rag and kids if you're deciding to do
this too don't use your parent sponge
just use a old shirt as a rag and yes
wear gloves with this stuff I'm going to
get on you about that wear gloves with
this stuff even if you're washing in
your sink make sure too if you're
washing this in your kitchen sink that
it's empty there is no dishes and after
you're done scrub your sink
down and it's F to go down the
drain but look at this this is some
pretty amazing results I left this out 2
days later so I put this out Friday at
2:40 p.m. and now it is Sunday 3:15 p.m.
so this will be Now 49 hours just
about but wow so now what I'm going have
to do is I got to put all the internals
back inside the head you can see how
empty it
is
so here's the back the back plate and
you see how it says 98 all smudge dor
that means it was made in
1998 and then here's a chamber this is
all separate
and this foam does go on the side so you
got to start off by putting your foam
down and while you're in this sh this
chamber you might as well blow it out if
you're going to use it so I'm going to
do that really
quick and see how these little mirrors
there's this like little cube in here
with this
lens this is pretty amazing look this is
like an infrared sensor and then there
I'm not sure what this
is
but there's that I have no idea what
that is I know that's probably infrared
sensor and then that's just the green
LED that
flashes so there's these two little
Clips here there's these two
clips and there's these little Windows
here line the clips up with those little
window openings
and you should hear it click like
that make sure that your Clips are in so
this is put back together the chamber
onto the head so now you got to line up
this infrared and then whatever that
is so this part goes right
here make sure everything lines up it
should hop in there smoothly if it
doesn't don't don't Force the board in
cuz you're going to break something
here's the back of the seam and smoke
detector there's a chip right there
another
chip freaking some
capacitors and whatever a GE resistor or
diode there's a lot of little tiny
resistors on this board so
now light you got to screw this in first
there's four screws that came out of
this two to hold the board in and two to
hold this back plate back
in So
now see how this is spacing if you're
going to put this back together need to
do it the right way otherwise things
will go wrong so now I got a Phillip
screwdriver I'm going put the camera
down so I could screw it back in
there
now see where those two screws are at
make sure they're on the left and right
side of the chip the long part now I got
to put this back lay back on it should
just pop in there like that and you put
your last two screws in there and that's
it you're complete you're ready to hook
it back up to your alarm system this was
an extra but I'm going to actually
install this in my room I'm going to
replace one of
them here you go here's your head all
put back together ready to be powered
back up on the system
again this will work with a bunch of
varieties of
plastics and if you really want to make
it like ghost
white you leave it out a couple more
days like but every two days you have to
throw away the old stuff because
the the chemicals will separate I hope
