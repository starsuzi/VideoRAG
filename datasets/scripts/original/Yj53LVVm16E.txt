I got my tools Wow the bugs have already
start crawling them okay so we're going
to go and begin cutting them the seeds
are definitely ready and I don't want to
get mouldy on me I'm very nervous
because I love the sunflower and it's
it's getting to that point so you can
see it's starting to dry out and I'm
going to you see it's trying to dry out
on me but it like it's just about ready
and I've had it now for a couple of
months so we're gonna cut it and we're
going to see if the seeds are time and
we're also gonna probably cut these
smaller heads too so yeah
so we're going to the smaller sunflowers
first and as you can see they are
definitely ready so let's cut off the
spit is where cut that loose and it's
gonna fall so
head there
everyone that
pull this out the ground
so that the root system
can die
because its seeds are definitely ready
the seeds are definitely ready
that's it this here
and get this you go ahead to
you know this film is still very
difficult because I love my plants and
it's really weird being the one to
destroy them but it's part of the
process of harvesting the seeds
wise nuts a nut tree this guy he thing
got broke some got clean these all up
so now we're going to this little guy I
think this is about the biggest one of
the game but seeds and I like to fit the
middle so that it won't be so hard to
get the head this guy's gonna be hard
because I don't know how I'm gonna cut
through this middle we're gonna see
though so I'm in my garage and I need to
get something a little more heavy-duty
for the big guy because I'm not gonna
live okay so I'm a little nervous about
cutting the head off not gonna lie to
y'all guys I am really nervous about it
cuz is huge and I'm a little scared so
I'm using I'm gonna get it oh I'm on
trip especially with something like
sharpen my hand let's hope for the best
ah I managed to film that and cut it how
awesome was that use my thigh
alright so let's begin cut any more of
it alright so we got the head right here
this big lovely girl and I'm like
literally using my feet so I kept them
at the same time so as you can see it
was hollow and was just about ready for
me to harvest it and I'm gonna finish
cut up the rest of this talk and I'll
come back to show you all my lovely
heads this was pretty good
way better than the scissors which I
have been been using it actually nobody
fried go let's take a look at this here
oh why this man is beautiful that's
massive to it starting to mold on me as
I cut it off so I was afraid that it was
gonna molt and I didn't want that so
we're gonna harvest the seeds hopefully
later and see how it goes
can't leave them down here the animals
are we'll take it and have their own CD
party now the only I gotta do is figure
out what I'm going to put or where I'm
gonna put my flowers at okay so as
you've done one hand in it so I'm gonna
just brush off the flower parts as we
just see some the seeds hey see them
it is fresh enough all the plant life I
look at the seeds there about I wanna
let it dry out a little bit but they
look like they're about ready
and that's the fight is on a mole Gotti
seeds Wow
you see all of them
and you can see like it was trying to
mole at the top that was really good it
feels fun good I'm gonna go do it to the
other heads till I see how the other
ones are faring I bet I leave it there
so just cross it away in their way in
it's hard work but it's totally work fit
it's ambiguous we shall see how the LMOs
turned out now let me try and hope this
force won't eat them so let's see we can
see the seeds though right here that's
why got some seeds happening
I need us to dry out too
this one this one peg was the most dry
but it look like it's ready
and it for the seats
right around the edge this will go on I
see but both um need to dry out
but so far I got uh I got four
sunflowers mosquito was Tammy up I got
for sunflower hits three small one big
and I'll probably come back to you on
about three days when this thing that
has a fully Drive if I don't come back
or if I come back in my room
I can hear over my irritation then
you'll know that um
something ate the heads and I'll let
show a metal but we're gonna say
hopefully will work out support that
rocks putting the molar container I'm
going to entrap with that big guy in
there I think you'll fit right here and
then I'm going to leave them somewhere
to dry out and we're gonna see how it
goes and those gonna have a bunch of
worms coming out of it so I'm I would
look forward to that but um he lets
Thank You bunny seeds out looks like
that's not with my skills is trying to
eat me listen he's got a tryout before I
pull any seeds out but I'm yeah it was
pretty good
we'll see how that goes it's getting me
so until next time and if I don't come
back outside and you know what happened
