hey guys you know maybe you've used a public 
restroom or something and you know it's kind  
of sketchy you know like who's been there so 
I just want to tell you like carry some 91%  
isopropyl alcohol with you I love this stuff and 
go ahead and sterilize that seat so just kind of  
take it you can put your finger over if you want 
to control the flow but you just kind of like pour  
on okay you know maybe it's way to seeing what 
guess what take some paper towels they have our  
toilet paper like lift the lid like seriously 
like and then like take your rag and you don't  
want to dry it you just kind of want to make sure 
everything is covered okay it's like it's just  
kind of like sketchy you know like who's used 
it so and the great thing about alcohol is that  
it drives itself so I mean I just kind of poured 
a bunch on you don't have to do as much as I did  
but this dries itself it's self evaporating so at 
least when you go to use it it's like you know it  
can kill germs so I would recommend to like don't 
have any sparks when you use this because it's my  
so you know thanks for watching guys please 
get a thumbs up if you liked it and if you  
don't like it instead of doing a thumbs down 
you can still get a thumbs up and you can  
put in a comment where you suggest thank 
you so much for watching have a good day
