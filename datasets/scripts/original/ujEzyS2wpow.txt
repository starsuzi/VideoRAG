and plus this its BPA free. Now
I put this on the side and this is the sausage
and we can start to use the sausage and
I cut it in three pieces.
make sure the knife it's nice and sharp. I cut it like that.
This is the hot sausage and this it's
the sweet sausage.
Can see the difference inside. See

it's not red it's a different color because this you got the oh yeah baby
inside. Now to make the sausage and pepper
I got everything ready, I chop
everything over here.

green.
I got a couple of pieces of garlic. I got
onion. This it's one onion, but it's
really big onion I did. And this is the
plum tomato. I squeeze already with

to start, I got oil over here. I put on
this pots like this. And to start, I
gotta put this on the stove.
And I start to fry the sausage. Now, put

pepper. Now with this you can cook rice
on the side and it can use the sausage
with the sauce

cook on top of the stove or you can put, if the pots is good for the oven
