hi there for my bell dress I'm going to
make I think possibly about four
petticoats to go underneath the
dress what I'm
using is I've got my old Disney gelle
pett coat right here just to give you an
idea of what we'll be
doing except it won't have these roughly
strips on it I'm just going to make four
full neck petticoats to make the dress
bloun
out and for my
template I've used
this and redrew around it and added 1 cm
all the way around for your seam
allowance so this is the idea that we're
going to go along with over here on the
table I've already cut out my
pieces this will be around the
front the seam there the seam there then
these will be my back
opening like so and and I've had to cut
another one out as well so you've got
two looking exactly the
same one will be your
lining next thing to do is to line your
yolk pieces
together making sure you have your good
side that's your outside to your other
good
side
so that's your see outside on the
piece you have the piece on top so your
seam is inside seam is standing
up and then I'll have to sew all the way
along the top
only just to draw those
together
okay I've now sewn my yolk all the way
across the top
there see the sew in line I've also gone
down the side as
well and the same for the other
side
so next thing to do is to get your
scissors and clip into the corners don't
clip the sewing line because otherwise
all your stitches will come and done you
clip the corners on curves to help your
garment
uh it's the
word curve more easily that's it it's
the
word okay I've now clipped into my
Corners like
so careful that you don't actually cut
on the seam where your flaps
are
and to create less bulk at the corners
here we've cut diagonally down
there and the same on the other side at
the
top next thing we're going to do is get
the iron and press the seams out better
so they lie
flat and we're going to turn
it the right way out and give it a good
press with the iron
okay the next thing you're going to need
is lots and lots and lots of Ral Nets
now you don't want a net that's too soft
and you don't want one that's too hard
so went for a nice vling tool and I
think it was white but it might be
Ivory next thing you do is cut
strips uh or for mine because of my
measurements they had to be4 CM from the
top to the bottom so that's how wide my
strips are and I've just
cut cut lots and lots and lots and lots
and lots of
it probably way more than I needed but
it's better to have
more than
less sorry about the crocodil in the
background he's making a
racket
next you need to ruffle your
net all those strips you can just first
of all you get all your strips and you
join them all
together and then after you just put
them through your machine using your
ruffling foot um if you want to see our
tutorial on Scarlet Tara's ruffle gown
you'll see as choing the ruffling foot
there and how to use it just to save me
explain it all over again and if you
need extra help just go on
YouTube and type ruffling foot and there
plenty of tutorials that show you how to
use it that's if you don't want fancy
doing meters and meters by
hand okay carrying on from our yolk
we're now going to put several layers of
petticoat onto the yolk and what we
decided to do
was get quite a
stiff um gold
net
and I just lift up these skirts that's
attached to the top of the yolk
underneath
gathered and then you sew the next layer
on and gather that
up and then the third layer and gather
that we the measurement from trac's
height and divided it by three so that's
what you have to do with yours so that's
the bottom
layer and then we started putting on
another
layer which was gathered and then the
next slot is gathered onto the bottom of
that and I've just done
two on this side for the moment the two
layers there one on top of the other and
I'll each have another gathered panel
put onto the
bottom I've just started on this side
Gathering a panel for the bottom tier
and as you can see it sticks out quite
away once it's done we might yet put
another layer on top of this we're not
sure yet we'll see how it looks with the
gold material for the
dress each one layer of ptico takes
approximately six M of
net so far we've
used 18 M of N and it's not finished
yet here we have the finished petty
coat so several thousand M later is a
exaggeration
then we have the middle yolk where we
started I've only done I was initially
going to do the four
layers but in the end we've decided to
settle on three for
now I'm just going to pop it on the over
the hoop so you can
have you can get a better view of
it this just to give you an idea what it
looks like spread out and it took about
20 minutes to spread this all out and
now we're going to put it over the hoop
completely spoil
it and here we have my finished petty
coat over the
hoop we're going to just stick to the
three layers for
now we're just going to do trial outer
skirt that's the actual roof skirt we're
going to do a practice
run see how that turns
out and if we really need to add another
layer although it's looking pretty
full right
[Music]
now
I'm not really sure why but the front
seems to be sticking out more than the
back I'm not really sure why that
is but anyway if it works out right
after the trial skirt then I'm not going
to worry about it too much
because all this is basically to do is
just to add fullness
underneath and a bit more fluffiness if
you if you like to call
it okay everyone this is the finished
petat it has got three
layers and each layer has three
tiers as Tracy is trying to demonstrate
underneath is a really gold a really
stiff gold one followed by two layers of
stiff net now she's going to mess it
up if you give me a slow turn
please and now give me a faster
turn let's see that's petat
well
y okay you can stop twirling
now there you go one finished
pedot
