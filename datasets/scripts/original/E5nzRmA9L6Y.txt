To grill vegetable kabobs, first I'm going
to start off by seasoning them with salt and
a little bit of pepper. I already have the
pepper on the kabobs. Next, I'm going to place
it on the grill set to about three hundred
and fifty degrees. Since they're pretty full,
I'm going to go ahead and should I set them
a little bit further back, and we go ahead
and close the lid. And that's going to cause
the heat to rise just a little bit. I'm going
to go ahead and let them cook for about five
to seven minutes on each side and then they'll
be ready. And that is how you grill vegetable
kabobs.
