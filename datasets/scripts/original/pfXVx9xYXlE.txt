one of the first recipes and or
techniques that was taught to me in
cooking school was how to make the
proper cheese omelette
[Music]
once you master this technique you'll be
able to make all sorts of wonderful
variations from the classic ham and
cheese omelet to more elaborate mixtures
found in your favorite breakfast place
today let's keep it simple and make a
classic cheese omelette recipe
so first you just crack two eggs into a
mixing bowl
add two tablespoons of water
a little bit of pepper and a pinch of
salt
and you're going to want to whisk this
up really good
the water in here is going to help your
omelette become more fluffy so you have
a nice fluffy omelette
our next setup i've got a third cup of
grated cheese
and an 8 inch omelette pan you can use a
10 inch if you like
and we got this preheating we're going
to add a tablespoon of butter to the pan
with your high temp spatula that i
talked about
get the butter going
and you can test your pan to see if it's
ready for the egg by adding a drop of
water in there if the water really
sizzles
you know you're ready
i'm gonna do that right now
i don't know if you can hear that but
it's getting there it's ready
so as soon as that butter is all melted
we know our pan's nice and hot
all right
now just slowly pour in your egg
right away you can see the edges are
starting to cook
what you do is you take your spatula
you push in the cooked egg to the center
tilting your pan towards your spatula
every time
and we're going to do this process over
and over
until that
raw egg is all cooked
now if you're right-handed you're going
to place your cheese on the left side
if you're left-handed you'd put it in on
the right side
and this is because you're going to flip
it the spatula with your right hand
now all that heat that we just folded
over in there is going to cook that egg
and melt that cheese finally grab a
plate
and put your omelet on
if you've never made an omelet before
try the cheese omelet first then
experiment with some of your favorite
fillings hope you enjoy this thanks for
