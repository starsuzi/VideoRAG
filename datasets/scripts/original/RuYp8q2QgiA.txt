hello there miscella here from crafts
and more today i'm going to show you how
to make your own diy glitter or sand for
your sand art so all you need is some
salt and some food coloring and i'll
give you a closer look here now for the
uh sand art you want to use this regular
table salt just because they're they
don't really have a sheen to it and just
mix it in with your food coloring and
i'll give you a closer look and if you
want to do something more like a
glitter where a little give you you know
give it a little shimmer you want to use
some big some salt with bigger granules
such as sea salt they're not going to be
the same shiny glitter that you buy at
the store but if you don't have any
glitter on hand this is a good
substitute for your arts and crafts that
you want to do at home all you need is
two tablespoons of the sea salt or table
salt and three to four drops of food
coloring
so put three in there and just grab a
spoon or a popsicle stick and just
stir it in there until the color
distributes evenly
you can even just use the regular sea
salt if you want to use it
as glitter by itself so they look like
icicles here's our colored salt or
glitter
this is the table salt i use so it's
more of a
sand art texture or sand so if you have
any sand art you want to do
and
our colored
sea salt here
it's a great substitute so if you need
some glitter right away you just use
what you have at home i hope that you
