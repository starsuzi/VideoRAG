okay
on this little demo i'm going to show
you
what happens if you drop
drops of rubbing alcohol
into a wash
if you uh like to do um scenes like with
maybe some seashells or maybe even fish
and you wonder maybe how can you get
those little bubbles or the little
maybe things swimming through the ocean
that you don't really want to
necessarily draw or you can't really
draw in there it's just too hard to make
it look natural well this is a this is a
fun way to do this this is actually
something you could
teach your child just to kind of have
fun with too if they like fish or
whatever
to start with you put a nice big
wash of ocean color let's just start
with blue
i want this to be nice and juicy so
that's why i
wet that a little bit
actually i'm going to wet it a little
more even
this actually works better if it's
a lot of if the paint's not real dry so
we'll put a lot of
water and a lot of paint
you can change the color a little bit if
you want to add a little green
i think it make it more like an ocean
some of these uh beautiful blues these
cold blues
really make beautiful
ocean colors
nice juicy wash
okay
all right uh i have an eye dropper
and i'm first i'm going to uh this is
alcohol
rubbing alcohol
and i'm going to put just a little bit
of the alcohol
into the eyedropper
okay
and then i'm going to hold it over the
paper and you can see depending on
how much comes out
[Laughter]
you get a really big blob i didn't
really mean to get that big of a blob
let's see if we can control it just a
little bit more
yeah it worked at home
here we go
let's let it dry just a minute
i'm not sure if we can go back in and
put more paint on that but we'll try
just for let it dry just a smidgen
do it closer maybe
there
so that gives you these nice little um
i don't know is it a jellyfish who knows
what it is it could be uh
you know if you're into
more organic stuff and you want to do a
painting of different kinds of cells and
things this is a maybe a good way to
start that you can put some alcohol into
a little bottle that has sort of a
little needle nose
thing up here and just
push
the paint and make drops too
just sort of squeeze and push or you can
actually
draw with it
so you get all these nice little organic
things and if you think about it in a
bigger format
um
it would
be really neat if you had fish or a reef
some reef plants and so forth like that
also
you can spray it
as well and it'll give you more of a
a little spattering
you know maybe these little tiny fishes
and
all the little sea creatures you see
when you go snorkeling and so forth
so that's what alcohol does in a
very nice juicy
wash if you if your paint is too dry
you may find that uh you'll get a more
subtle effect
i did this one at home but the paint was
a lot drier when i put it on there so i
still get the effect of it but just not
as much as if it's nice and juicy
okay
