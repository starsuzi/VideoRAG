hi guys today we're going to be making
chicken enchiladas let's get started
with what you'll need you're going to
need some corn
tortillas sour cream some red in chilala
sauce some cheese chicken and some
chopped green
onions okay to start off you're going to
boil some
water and put your chicken breast in
there
can put a little salt as well and just
let it
cook or boil until
it's thoroughly cooked so now after your
chicken has boiled and it's cooled down
I just shredded it with my fingers and
now we're going to assemble the inala
casserole first you're going to get some
of your
sauce and just pour some here in the
bottom not too much just enough
okay then get your
tortillas and just lay them until it
covers the entire
bottom and get some sour
cream and spread it all around your your
uh tortillas
next you're going to get some
chicken and just sprinkle it on
everywhere evenly
next some
cheese next some green
onion and then another layer of
tortillas so once you're done with your
second layer you're going to get some
more sauce and just pour it on
top and it's just going to see
through the
layers and you're going to get another
layer of tortillas
and we're going to bake this at 350 for
about 20 minutes so it's been about 20
minutes and our inila casserole is done
this meal is intended to be very easy
and something you can throw together
very
quickly I hope you guys enjoyed it and
I'll see you next time bye thanks for
