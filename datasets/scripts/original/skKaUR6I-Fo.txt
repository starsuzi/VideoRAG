Hello today we are going to talk about the
general process of cleaning your tires during
the car wash process, the things that you
are going to need is an all purpose tire cleaner,
tire dressing, the tire dressing applicator
and a brush to clean the tires. The first
thing you want to do is spray it down with
your tire cleaner, brush and agitate the cleaner
along the wheels of the tires. Another important
step is to take a microfiber towel and dry
the tire removing any brake dust, wipe the
tire down. Another important step that people
often forget is cleaning the wheel wells so
that if you have any dirt that is trapped
up in here it won't fall back down on your
tire. So once I have sprayed my cleaner I
take my brush and then go along the wheel
well making sure to loosen any dirt there
and take my sprayer, spray inside of the wheel
well, take a microfiber cloth and dry the
wheel well making sure that you get all up
in there so we don't have any debris falling
upon the tire. After we have done that we
are going to take our tire dressing and we
are going to spray some on our applicator.
You can do it two ways or spray it directly
on the tire like so making sure that you go
back counterclockwise and clockwise then we
are going to take our applicator and then
work the tire dressing on to the tire.
Then what you have is a fully cleaned and
dressed tire.
