hey guys this is Diego from my we Expo
Cannell I'm gonna show you how to do a
very easy insemination just with a 10 cc
syringe or what you want to do is you
want to clean the area really good you
don't want to get any bacteria in there
and all you do is you put the syringe up
okay upwards okay you push it in and you
inseminate you wait there in about three
minutes and that's it as soon as she's
ready you're gonna see that she's gonna
start pumping there you go so that makes
the suction go in and that's it very
simple technique and insemination you
want to hold it in there for about three
minutes and nothing comes back up Lucy
here's the syringe thank you guys for
watching
