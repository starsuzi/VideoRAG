good morning everyone i'm kelly and i'm
caitlin and we have
hot pickled okra today on
30 and 30. yes i can't believe you
wouldn't do it how could i not do it
okay 30 and 30. there we
oh my go we're on day 20. hot pickled
okra
okay so this is more a food for thought
situation
we will give you a formal recipe for hot
pickled okra
it's down below but this is just my
favorite way to make a quick pickle
pickling is very much a science and
there
you can get a whole degree just in
pickling uh we were lucky enough to meet
paul verrant from v
up in chicago and perennial yes and
he really specializes in tanning and
pickling you have to know ph levels all
of that good stuff well
i don't know any of those things i just
know how to make a delicious quick
pickle that is that's the key word quick
pickle yeah
so to a sauce pot
here actually i'm going to give kelly a
job first should we move the finished
product
to get everyone excited about what's
going to come okay so these are just
cute mason jars and i like to use okra
there's something different
um that people don't expect or know to
eat and pickling them
and preserving them in their whole form
keeps them
from getting slimy which is usually why
people don't enjoy okra because they get
slimy so um they absorb flavor
heat they're just a delicious side i
think i said fried chicken this is a
good
gateway recipe kind of for okra people
for people who think they don't like
okra would you agree yeah
my children love this my children love
this we go through tell them what they
call pickled red onions
oh princess noodles that's what we used
to call it because this same liquid
works
for um red onion and we cut it up
well obviously you cut up the onion and
the the brilliance of the
the purple onion leaches out and becomes
like a
pink princess noodle that's what you
tell little girls and they love it my
kids eat
pickled onions and pickled okra like
it's going actually we go through
several jars a week because they want it
in their lunch even okay so
white vinegar you can do two parts
vinegar to one part water
depending on how much tang you want so
for this recipe i'll do a cup of vinegar
did you say what was in there or not yet
just one sorry
a cup of vinegar to and then add a half
cup of water
and then equal parts salt and sugar salt
emphasizes flavor
sugar helps to minimize the punch of
acidity
in your mouth for these pickles i added
red pepper flakes and pickling spice
which is actually a combination of
seeds and crumbled bay leaves different
things like that
but you look for pickling spices
pickling spice you want me to pull it
down yeah pull it down
show them what we're working with show
the people okay so all we have to do is
bring this to a boil until the salt
and sugar dissolve and then that is it
so i feel like we um can bubble gum all
the different things that we have
pickled
asparagus green beans onions okra
cucumbers of course we've done a pickled
mixture for like the top of the bond
meat so carrots and daikon
yes i feel like you've done beets and
radishes i've definitely done radishes
word to the wide with wise with radishes
is that they give off a different scent
they're kind of stinky when they're
pickled
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah we were green
asparagus hey caitlin okay
so then you're going to pour that are
you going to show everybody how you do
that
yeah am i going to hold it no i'll hold
it okay good i don't want to get it
splashed
okay but this is the finished product so
here's a question for you
the difference between this quick pickle
and
paul veron's canning and jarring and
pickling that's all very scientific
is that this won't last through the
winter right exactly you need to eat
this
within a week or so yeah week or two um
yes that is the biggest thing okay
because he has like truly done the
science of
and like you have to boil the jars and
all that we have not done this
no most of the time i keep them in
ziploc bags until
i know i was gonna save it all the um
i usually get them an old gladwear they
don't have a lid they're saran wrapped
their doubles were unwrapped but these
really nice and yeah you can okay so the
vinegar
salt sugar and water are staples you can
play with it in a lot of different ways
uh you could even add vanilla bean whole
jalapenos
any fresh herb that you want if you want
to make a
dill pickle add tons of fresh dill
garlic
onion shouts whatever you want aromatics
and that is how you do it that's like
the canvas
yes and you can even play with it
um the vinegar you oh and they just
popped right up
there happy to see you yay there you go
shake it up keep it on your pantry
yeah use it to garnet i mean eat it just
says it is
use it to garnish grilled cheeses bloody
berries
oh good calling bloody mary um also i
mean anything at the bar that you would
normally put like a an onion or an olive
use some pickled okra it's good on all
sandwiches oh and you said fried chicken
at the beginning
yes ma'am that's it that's what we got
for you that's 30 and 30 for today
we have more tomorrow it'll be great
goodbye
