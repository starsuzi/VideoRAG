good
morning I decided to make this video for
people who love fresh coffee there's
nothing quite as good as taking whole
beans grinding them yourself and then
brewing a fresh batch of coffee in a
percolator we happen know a Vitamix
blender so I looked up some instructions
on how to take whole coffee beans and
grind them into the consistency that
would be good for a
percolator so so if you look here this
is the
instructions use the special dry grain
jar of the Vitamix turn the speed to one
turn on the machine and quickly increase
to number eight grind the desired degree
of finess between 10 seconds for course
and 20 seconds for espresso and then
turn off so I'm just going to
demonstrate what to do basically we're
going to take two cups
of the whole beans which this particular
one is an organic Bean that we picked up
from Costco for about $14 you got 2 lbs
of organic coffee
beans and we're going to place it in
this dry container okay you can tell
that it's a different type of thing
because the blade is actually uh meant
to smash what's ever in it and you can
kind of see that it actually has the
word dry on the blade
but it's worth worth investing in
because it allows you to do peanut
butter and hummus and anything you need
to smash and kind of pulverize into a
creamy consistency you can use
that but um the end result is you
get nice very
consistent coffee grains and uh we're
using we use a percolator so we like it
on the coar side and what I found in in
my first batch here is that about 12
seconds is right for me so we're going
to demonstrate that in a second
here okay so now I'm going to
take two
cups of whole coffee beans and I'm going
to put it into the dry container
one
and all
right and and I'm going to set this to
one and I'm going to put the lid
on real
tight CU it's a fine powder as you grain
so as you grind rather and uh you don't
want it to get all over your
kitchen so all I'm going to do here is
I'm going to turn it on just as the
instructions say and I'm going to
increase the speed all the way to eight
and count out to 12 here we
go and that's it 12 seconds
later we have
grinded into a nice consistency
coffee
grinds you kind of see
that hopefully it's
good so I'm going to put it in my
storage container and uh be done you
don't want to do much more than two cups
though because then some of it can get
stuck at the bottom and you get these
really really fine pieces and these
really really coarse pieces so by doing
smaller batches you get a more
consistent uh process to happen all
right I hope this video was uh
interesting and helpful
