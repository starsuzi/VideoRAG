now we're going to replace a set of
brake pads on your
bicycle to complete this you will need
your trusty Allen key and your new brake
pads begin the process again with your 5
Mallon key simply
open the pinch bolt and allow the cable
to drift
back giving us room to access the brake
pads with a 5 mil Allen
key open the side knot on the brake
pad simply unscrew it again turning to
the left
and lift out the pad like so don't be
too concerned at this point about any of
the
washers which are on the brake pad
because your new brake pad comes with a
full set of washers in
place the system with the washers is
quite
simple there are six of them and they're
divided into into a long silver
part a brass piece which sit
together and a short silver piece
again you can see the curvature on the
inside here and the second brass piece
which is designed to maray in with that
piece so our brake pad has the long
silver piece and the small brass part
simply slide
the brake pad back into the brake
caliper with the two washers on the
inside
followed by the second small silver
washer and the brass piece like
so
complete the job by putting on the
outside washer and the lock knot
turning this to the right once we have
it in place with the Allen key
again and Loosely position we don't want
to overtighten at this
point now let's do the other side
and again the same process Allen key in
place
remove the outside
Locker place down
remove the washers from the
outside and simply slide out the old
brake pad from the
caliper leaving that to one side
we have our second brake pad and
again screw off the lock
nut lift off the outside washers leaving
the two on the
inside and
place the second brake
pad into the
caliper follow this again with the
silver washer and the brass piece again
which is designed to muray in
the last small
washer and finally the lock knot on the
outside of the brake
pad and again at this point we're not
aiming to overtighten Simply to have
your brakes in
place when you're doing this
job if you have removed both brake pads
from the front and you have opened up
these and you you get a little bit
confused about the washers simply
refer to your back brakes which are in
place and repeat exactly what you can
see on the back
brakes to place the front brake pads in
place once we have this
done let's open up the pinch bolt again
and pull the cable
through to its original position
now what we want to do our brake pads
are in place we simply at this point
want to go back to each brake
[Music]
pad loosen them very slightly and line
the brake pad up with the rim again I'm
not going to overtighten I'm simply just
holding that in
place do the same on the opposite side
open it slightly you can see the pad
will move up and down along the caliper
here and simply it up until it's level
with the brake pad at this point just
give it a slight tighten to hold it in
place now what we want to do is to pull
the brakes and in doing so we're forcing
the pad against the rim ensuring that
the pad is absolutely straight against
the rim the pressure that I'm applying
here will actually straighten that pad
for you once you have it in place and
straight still holding the brake lever
up here so that the pressure is
maintained
simply tighten off the brake pad you
don't need to overtighten on these
simply tighten it until you get a good
bite on this lock knot here at the
outside still holding on to the brake
lever at this point I'm turning it
around and tightening the pad on this
side our pads are now replaced tightened
and lined up against the
rim at this point the brakes are still a
little bit loose so we have two options
we can open the pinch bolt
here take up a little bit of slack from
the cable and tighten it again or we can
use the feral adjusting nut on the lever
itself turn it
anticlockwise this takes up again some
of the slack from the inner cable moving
the pads closer to the rim and when
you're happy with that position simply
turn the inside lock knot back against
the lever this stops the feral sliding
back and
forward those bikes are stopping us
we're very happy with that
