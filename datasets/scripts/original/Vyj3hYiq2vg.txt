hey this is David the Shepherd School
and today we're going to make a mopic
cheese culture uh from buttermilk meso
means medium filic means loving medium
loving talking about temperature so this
is the colder of the two uh uh cheese
cultures later we're going to do Thermo
philic cultures um from like yogurts
this is good for making um like sour
cream some Cheddars you know some of the
the lower temperature um cheeses so all
you do is get you some room temperature
buttermilk
okay pour about two cups of
it in a container okay
and then you let it sit out for about 10
hours at room temperature it's not room
temperature it might take a little
longer you might want to cover it up
with a piece of cheesecloth or something
so uh you know your cat or whatever
don't get into it uh or you know or bugs
or whatever but what's going to happen
is as it sits out it's going to the
cultures are St to grow it's going to
make the buttermilk a lot thicker a
little
stringier you know clumped together um
and that that brings up the the count of
the
bacteria regular but buttermilk as you
get at the store the cultures aren't
high enough in the milk to uh to do what
you want so you're going to have to let
some grow so we're going to come back 8
hours and let this sit out overnight and
show you what it looks
like Okay so we've let it sit out
overnight and I don't know if you could
tell but it's a lot thicker and it's
kind of got
a little bit of a crust on there it's a
whole lot different from
when it came out of the U container okay
so now what we're going to do is we're
just going to pour it it's
clumpy and so we know something's
happening and it smells actually pretty
good we're just now going to put it in
the freezer okay so here's our Frozen
culture right the last
cubes each one of these
is the equivalent of an ounce of culture
so if your recipe calls for an ounce of
culture it's just one of these little uh
ice cubes and all I'm going to do is I'm
just going to put them in the plastic
bag here and throw them in the freezer
and uh I'm going keep
one one little bag as a uh a
leftover you know so when I use all of
them but the last bag of a couple of
these I use them to inoculate another
batch of milk to make some
more
starter so that's all there is to it and
