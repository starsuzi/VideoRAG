hey guys you all know i love a healthy
breakfast the entire family will eat
this banana baked oatmeal is quick
healthy and not surprisingly one of our
favorites
i'm meg and i'm passionate about finding
ways to make life with kids easier in
the kitchen
so let's go through ingredients you'll
need old-fashioned oats hemp hearts
coconut sugar cinnamon baking powder and
salt
almond milk melted refined coconut oil
vanilla an egg and two bananas we're
going to start by combining our dry
ingredients so i have my old-fashioned
oats and this is really what keeps your
kids going all morning long next we have
our hemp hearts you guys have seen me
use these a ton in smoothies i love them
because in one serving they have 10
grams of protein and 10 grams of omegas
for this baked oatmeal i love hemp
hearts because they add a nice nutty
flavor that really complements the
bananas
next we have our coconut sugar you can
feel free to use brown sugar if that's
what you have on hand
finally i have our cinnamon baking
powder and salt i'm gonna put those in
there and then give it a quick stir
next we're gonna combine our wet
ingredients so i have one egg that i'll
put into my bowl followed by a little
bit of vanilla i always add a little
extra than a recipe calls for because i
love the flavor and next i'm going to
use some refined coconut oil i'm using
refined today because i didn't want the
flavor of the coconut to overpower the
banana next we have our almond milk you
can really use whatever milk you have on
hand
and finally we have our bananas which
i've already mashed i'm going to put
them right in here and i love the way
they smell
i'm going to give it a quick stir
next i need to combine my wet and dry
ingredients so i'm going to pour my dry
right into the wet bowl
and then give it a quick stir
while my oven is preheating to 350
degrees i'm going to put my mixture into
a tin you can use a loaf pan but my kids
love anything in muffin form so that's
what i'm using today i'm just scooping
it in you notice i line half with liners
and half of just grease that's because
ryder cannot have the liners he will eat
them but my other kids love to peel them
off
these are going to bake in the oven for
about 20 to 25 minutes
my oatmeal is out of the oven looking
and smelling delicious i like to top it
with a little bit of maple syrup when
i'm serving it to the kids
one of the things i love about this
recipe is it reheats perfectly the next
day so if you have leftovers and you
likely will you will have happy kids for
a few days in a row i think this might
be my favorite breakfast you think so
it's pretty good huh
so there you have it baked banana
oatmeal i hope you guys love it as much
as we do thank you so much for watching
and i will see you next time bye guys
