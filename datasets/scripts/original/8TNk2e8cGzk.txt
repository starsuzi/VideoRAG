hey stop eating the chocolate chips
sorry I just they're still good all
righty hello everybody so today we're
going to be doing a recipe video we
haven't done a recipe video in a really
long time it feels like like over a
month since we've been in Australia at
least um and everyone's been asking me
to do more recipe videos and I
definitely will be this is the first of
many here and today we just felt like
making some pancakes so I thought why
not show you guys a really simple easy
and tasty recipe for some pancakes so
these pancakes that we're going to make
are definitely oilfree um we're not
going to make them gluten-free today but
if you want to make them gluten-free all
you have to do is subm in gluten-free
flour for the all-purpose flour that
we're going to be using today I'm going
to make my own version of
Pancakes Kyle's really excited for
pancakes and Kyle's going to make his
own version what kind of you what are
you making I'm making blueberry lemon
pancakes today Blueberry Lemon I think
I'm going to make chocolate chip of
course cuz you're sitting there munching
on the chocolate chips so let's get into
the recipe chocolate peanut butter oh
peanut butter chocolate peanut butter
pancakes okay so first we're going to
make the Chia eggs you need two Chia
eggs for this recipe so I have 2
tablespoon of Chia
seeds I have 6 tbspoon of water here and
then we're just going to mix it together
and you got CH egg
and then you're just going to set that
aside and let the chia seeds activate so
next I've got two cups of you can use
any plant-based milk that you want but
we're using coconut milk and I'm going
to add in the juice of one lemon the
reason why I'm adding lemon juice to the
milk is so the milk kind of that the
lemon juice curdles the milk a little
bit and it gives the pancakes a little
bit of a nicer texture and it kind of
makes it almost like buttermilk I
learned this when I was working at the
vegan restaurant and it's so awesome
it's really cool
so you can see it already like curdling
a little bit look at that that's gross
looks gross but works well I'm also
going to add in 2 tablespoons of maple
syrup
a teaspoon of vanilla extract o that was
a little more and that's all of our wet
ingredients that we need for the flour
we just have this huge bag of Bob's
Redmill allpurpose flour it's Bob's
Redmill is like the bomb not sponsored
but yeah so that's the flour that we're
using and then I'm going to add in some
baking powder and baking
soda
and I'm also going to add a pinch of
salt salt is
[Music]
B and then this is what your Chia egg
should sort of look like they're all
kind of like stuck
together add
that into the mixture
it's good if you can let your batter sit
a little bit longer um cuz then the chia
seeds will get even more jelly so I'm
going to let that sit for like 5
minutes
stoping people are going to miss me be
like where's Kyle that whole recipe it
was a quick recipe it was a quick recipe
guys I'm sorry I should have let you mix
some stuff yeah I was just so into it
look mixy Mixie look you did it I did it
I made the pancakes guys I don't really
know how many pancakes this makes but
got to wait for it to heat up
[Music]
too there is flax egg on the corner of
the table Chia egg I should put that in
the you need all the chia seeds you can
possibly get it's not a perfect recipe
if you don't get all the chia seeds in
there do I put the chocolate chips in
like I know when to put them in
actually they go in your mouth first
right I'm scared scared for what these
are look these look so
liquidy but they look amazing tip for
when making pancakes I feel like
everybody in the world knows this but
you want to wait till your pancakes have
like a ton of bubbles on them and the
outside of the pancake is like kind of
dried out a little bit almost so like
the top shouldn't look liquidy at all it
should be like matte if that makes sense
Mak sense cuz I'm a professional chef
and you know I'm really good at making
pancakes stop eating them you're not
going to have any to put in
pancake not enough bubbles not
enough right
babe you know first Pancake never turns
out well that was the practice
round M
you just needed to let it cook on the
one side a little bit longer oh my God
there's a huge bee in here really go
back
outside don't go outside save the bees
people don't kill bees if there's a bee
in your house do not kill it save it and
put it outside if the bees die we all
die where the heck did he
go I think I got him I think I got him
going to let Mr Bee go
now and that's how you save a bee
everybody this this isn't just a recipe
video we're giving you life
tips number two people let's see if it's
better than the number one bam why do
you flip it over like that the other
side looks nicer chocolate chips are
burnt because I need to put the

better oh mine are so good that
blueberry like jam stuff on top so
good I'm bite yours I want peanut butter
on
it you like
it not as much as mine of course
not mine's chocolatey and fatty oh
wow definitely mine are definitely way
more
light M these are really good though and
these pancakes are more like thin
they're not like super like fluffy like
thick
pancakes but woo there's so many
different recipes for pancakes like you
can make pancakes so many different
ways I think we both like our pancakes
more thin yeah I love them thin but you
can just stack them so it's like you're
eating a big pancake
yeah kind of cool how this recipe video
kind of turned out into a little
friendly competition
yeah it was fun to see which one's
better um let us
know which ones that you would make go
and try go and try and make both of
these and then let us know what you
think but I already know people like
peanut butter and
chocolate better than
blueberry am I right or am I right I
like am I right or am I right I like
them both but it just depends on like
what you're feeling if you want
something like heavier and like more of
a tree like this tastes fresh and light
mine tastes sugary and fatty and it's
like more of like a treat style pancake
I could definitely see myself being in
the mood for some fresh
Light um pancakes but mhm for most of
the time I'm always craving something
like fatty sugary
chocolatey I think everybody knows that
already I'm almost done
already
all right guys so the pancakes were a
hit
clearly I definitely liked mine better
