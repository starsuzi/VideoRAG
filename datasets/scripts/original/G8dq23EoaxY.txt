asalam alaikum and welcome to title's
busy kitchen with me titly hard today
I'm going to cook a Chinese dish which
is a little bit different and if you
like garlic you're going to love this
for my brazed beef with garlic or is it
garid braced beef anyway I've got 450 G
of beef cut into cubes most cuts of beef
will do for this look on my website for
more
details here there are two whole bulbs
of garlic two bulbs yes that's right two
bulbs of
garlic and each of the cloes has been
peeled and we're going to leave these
whole 250 Ms of beef stock six spring
onions cut into 1 in sections 2 tbsp of
rice vinegar 2 tbsp of soy sauce a table
spoon of potato flour or if you don't
have potato flour in your kitchen just
use corn flour or corn starch instead
and a/ qu of a teaspoon of salt I've
heated 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in
a walk as you can see the smoke is
starting to come up going to add in the
garlic and toss these around until they
start to take on
color shouldn't take more than about 30
seconds now I'll add in the meat
and I'm going to stir fry this now for
about 2 to three
minutes after 2 or 3 minutes dribble
this rice vinegar down the sides of the
rock give it a good
stir and just let it simmer over quite a
high heat for about a minute to get rid
of some of the
liquid now remove from the
heat transfer the contents to a
reasonably large pan
then add in the soy sauce the
salt and the beef
stock pop it back on the stove and bring
it to the
boil once it comes to the boil turn the
heat right down cover and simmer it very
gently for 1 and 1 half to 2 hours or
until the meat is really tender from
time to time check the water level top
up with a little bit of hot water if
necessary
after a couple of hours the meat should
be really tender and most of the garlic
should have
disappeared now dissolve the potato
flour in a little bit of water and add
it
in bring the sauce back to the
boil add in the spring
onions stir them
in cover and leave for 30
seconds now
serve brazed beef with garlic make sure
you eat this with a friend unless you
want to be Billy no mates it's an
absolutely delicious dish but not the
kind of thing you want to be eating just
before a job interview join me next time
in title's busy kitchen with me titly
nhan until next time hold Happ
