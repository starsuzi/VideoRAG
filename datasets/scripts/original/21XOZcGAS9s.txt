Let's talk about Calatheas
Patch call this one Juliet and this one Julia. They're both totally beautiful. It's difficult to believe that these
incredible tropical plants thrive in our little British homes, but they do
In fact, they do some pretty cool stuff as well. Every night, these amazing leaves will curl up and then they unfold the morning after
Because they come from tropical environments calatheas really like moisture and humidity in the air
That doesn't mean you need to keep them like next to your shower
But it does mean that you need to keep an eye on their foliage
Because it will show signs of distress if it's not getting enough moisture
If a calatheas leaves turn brown, be dry or generally look a bit unhappy
Chances are that it's not getting enough moisture and you need to get a little mister
or a spray gun out to make sure that you're putting enough water vapour into the air
Just because they love humidity, it doesn't mean that they want dripping wet soil all the time. In fact, barely any plants like that
Instead make sure that the soil is generally fairly moist and always check before watering
It's a good idea to let the top two inches of soil dry out a little before you go and water again
And never leave a plant standing in a load of water at the bottom of the pot. Nobody likes that
As with calatheas, they will put up with indirect light; that's their fave
So a shady corner of a bright room is pretty much perfect
And if you're happy to admit that you don't know anything about how to look after plants
But you'd kind of like to change that then we made a beginner's house plant parenting course, it should tell you everything you need to know
You can find it on the Patch website
