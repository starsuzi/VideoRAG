hey guys today we will be making our own
citronella candles the materials that
you will need
are some wax
Wicks they do come in a smaller um size
but I just chose the the longer one I
can always trim them this I got at my
local craft
store you will also need some sticks you
can use popsicle sticks
Chopsticks pens whatever you have on
hand at home you also will need some wax
I got this 100% natural soy wax from my
craft
store you will also need three
pennies some jars I I decided to do
these little cute pots that I got at
Dollar Tree the actually the pennies are
to um cover the little hole there
and of course your essential oil
citronella let's get
started first thing we're going to
do is take our pennies and place them at
the bottom of our
pots just to cover up that little hole
[Music]

we then are going to take our wax um
Wicks and place them in our
jars I did cut mes
[Music]
shorter now you can
glue the wicks to the bottom so they
don't move and go anywhere once you pour
the wax in but I think I'm going to try
it without the
glue so we'll see how that
works you're going
to wrap the
wick around the stick because the stick
is going to keep the wick from falling
in
your in your little pot or jar whatever
you decide to use and it's going to go
just like that
[Music]
Now with an old
pot um I'm going to melt the
wax I'm going to use this and place it
in another pot with um with hot water
now I've seen people use um you know
recycled um coffee cans some people they
actually went out and bought the actual
right stuff to make candles but
unfortunately I don't have those item so
I'm going to wing it so here we go I
then am going to pour my wax into um a
measuring cup and I'm going to do about
2 cups of
this so here's one cup of the wax and
I'm going to pour it into my old pot and
start
melting and as I'm melting I will be
stirring and then that's when I will add
my essential oil
and now we're going to pour our wax into
our little pot
here just be very very careful I'm using
an old plate to um to help with any
spills come on
[Music]
okay guys here are the results of the
citronella candles I just made I just
want to discuss a few things that I
probably would do differently next time
which is I would either glue the wick to
the
bottom um and I also probably would use
you know candle jars because it did leak
a little bit at the bottom so I had to
hurry up and throw it in the freezer for
a little bit just so they would get hard
um you could see that the Wicks aren't
centered
properly um this is my first time making
candles so now I know what to do you
know next
time they they came out fine I can still
use them and everything like that so
yeah hope you guys enjoyed this video
