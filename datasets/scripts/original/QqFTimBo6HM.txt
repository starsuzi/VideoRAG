wow this flower is amazing this is my
first time growing Hol Hawk
flowers and as you can see this flower
is very
big pretty big it's
about right here in my hand my palm and
that's it so this flower called Holly
Hawk and I'm going to show you many
other colors but right now this one is
maroon
red and here is white and purpous pink
and look at that the Bumblebee
[Music]
love to Bas in
it this one is light pink light orange
pinkish
orange you can see the Bumblebee enjoy
it
and not only the
Bumblebee but the
Beetles
so this one is light pink beautiful
light
pink you can see
that the beauty of this is about 10 ft
tall and look at that Bumblebee
biggest bum B I ever
seen enjoy
also so that's the light
pink here's the this is my favorite
color I love this color as you can see
there's more Beetle here so as soon as
I'm done with this video I'm going to
capture those Beetle for my chicken but
as you can see the beauty of
this and it grow this about 10 ft
tall 8 ft tall probably but this plant
is
panal and it's self seed so you can
see this one is producing seed right now
because the F flower falling off so when
the FL falling off it starting to fall
off look like that so this one is a full
bloom so this one is amazing it start to
flower since May and it's funny it
started from the bottom when I first
noticed it start to bloom you can see it
fall off like that so it start to bloom
on the bottom
here right now this one I saw this one
was the first one and then Bloom from
here and then it goes up but as you can
see this flower is very easy you can um
plant them from seed or you
can um when you dig when you dig this
you can even separate them from the root
and plant them from the roots so and I
can't wait to harvest all the seed or I
can just let it self seed
itself but as you can see
that this is very prune to this type of
disease so I'm just going to let it go
because it's just so much of it if I cut
it down it'll be so bare but this is the
beauty of the Holly
Hawk
okay and here's the yellow
to harvest the
seed and um I'm looking for a
dry this is not ready but this is
ready to harvest so I just wanted to see
how the seed looks I kind of know how
the seat looks but this is my first time
harvesting the
seat so let me share with you how the
seat
look it's a little tough to harvest but
here's the seat look at that next year I
can have a farm of Holly
Haw especially this pink color so that's
how the seat looks so this is my first
time
harvesting the Holly Hawk
seed I'm just too excited I can't wait
for all them to dry but I guess that one
dry first because that one bloom first
so I'm going to put these
away I'm going to come back and show you
how much seed I harvest from one plant
that I plant last
year this is how you save money and this
is how you save seed and this is how you
harvest
seed look how much
