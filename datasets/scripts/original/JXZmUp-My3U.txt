asparagus as your pieces are mostly
common is asparagus fern or foxtel fern
mostly used in cold climate for
houseplant
here you can use as you can see this is
garden and we are outside
it's a little bit tougher in the winter
but mostly
grow here while pruning
it's that branch
and there is it's invasive plant so if
you choose to grow it outside you need
to consider that it's already exists in
your location
if you grow it here so it means that
it's already grow if not you're risking
your environment for invasive plant
the plant can grow from full shade to
full sun it can survive in variety of
locations
Brewing season it's all there planting
indoor it can be all there again but
outdoor
recommended in the spring it's the best
season for growing for planting this
plant
there is a small berries
there were so poisonous so don't try to
eat it if you have a small children
recommended not to grow it it's look
very very tasty but it can cause for
some problem with the stomach ache and
other kind of things
if you grow it
indoors you need to fertilize it at
least two times zero
Outdoors require less carrying we just
put it and just grow here you know no
fertilize no nothing it's just this is
just growing as you can see
this one and I have here another one
it's super easy to grow it it doesn't
require much
again for ah
if you choose to grow It Outdoors you
should sometimes if it's spread very
viciously and it happens sometimes you
should just cut new branches that grow
outside and also clean the inner part
from the leaves not the material
and just
destroy to take the rotten area not
rotten the dead area inside after you
take it it will regrow from the inner
part uh so it's all from goldplans.org
