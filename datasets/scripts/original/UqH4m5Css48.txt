hey everybody we're going to make us
some pork sauces
today I don't know if you ever made any
pork sausage or not but I'll tell you
one thing if if you
have if you haven't you're spending way
too much money okay so what you do is
you do what we
do and go
to
uh
Costco buy like 20 lbs at a
time and just grind your own you know
what I
[Applause]
mean okay as you can see we ground us
the some pork now this is way more than
a pound of pork this is like three or
four pounds of pork I'm going to make
some sausages out of this but I'm only
going to make a pound worth of sausages
the rest of it I'm going to make some
pork steaks or something so uh we'll be
back okay now here's what we're going to
put in it what we have here is a hom
ground
roast actually pork butt pork shoulder
whatever you want to call it I kept out
one hand I ground a whole bunch but I
only kept out a pound first thing I'm
going to add is one tablespoon of brown
sugar
okay all
right 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of black
pepper all
right one teaspoon of
sage all
[Music]
right one pinch of
margar all
right a half
teaspoon of finel
seed all
right 1 and 1/2
teaspoon now it's make one teaspoon of
sea
salt
okay and
one
teaspoon of red chili flakes okay and A4
of a
teaspoon
of what is
this something that's important I don't
know we'll put it in
there I don't know what it is I think it
might have been I have to look at my
recipe okay anyway let's stir this up
and as you know oh I know what that was
that was cinnamon that was a/4 teaspoon
of cinnamon of all
things uh yeah yeah one4 teaspoon of
cinnamon it's just something I like all
right so what we going to do is we want
to put it all together
here Stir It Up really
nicely and you know the hands are the
best and don't leave n don't leave any
of it
un
combined
okay I don't know if you know it or not
when you buy sausage and you cook it at
home had a little chili flake Spilled
Out
uh it's full of fat okay when you buy a
pork shoulder it don't have near as much
fat in it for some reason
although that's what they make it with
but when you get this all mixed like
this
nicely uh I want you to cover it with
plastic and put it in the
freezerator for at least an
hour okay we're back it's been a couple
hours sausage has been in in the
refrigerator and what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to make a little bitty
Patty I'm going to make a little bitty
test Patty can you see can you see that
there you go right there see if it'll
hold together enough to to make a Patty
excuse the gloves everybody I'm I'm
doing a lot of cooking today and I don't
want to do no cross contamination so I'm
going to cook that little Patty right
there and see what she tastes
like you know everybody says I've never
have anything that don't taste good but
everybody says to test your meat prior
to cooking you know so you can reason or
whatever but I think it's going to be
cool but I'll do that I will uh I'll do
that I'll do a test Patty I have noticed
that some of the people on YouTube when
they show people how to make sausage
they add fat uh like uh what they
like Pig bottom pork belly fat and uh I
don't think you need it look at that it
looks plenty greasy to me I mean I try
to I try to get re rid of the good
grease when I'm cooking all I think it's
done yeah I believe she's done there so
let's let's cut us off a little chunk
over
here see what it looks like on the
inside oh yeah look at
that looks like a piece of saes to
me you see
that yeah better
I'm glad I didn't add no
salt that's it
y'all well that's it good stuff make
this sausage for breakfast you'll love
it
