hello
this is just one of my 10 inch pots
that I'll be growing vegetables in this
year
this is an all-made compost
it's a soil based compost
uh there's lots of organic matter in
there
and I'm going to do a quick pH test
okay the experts tell us the potatoes
like to grow
and between five and seven a pH of five
and seven
um
I've got a soil test mode today a
pre-edge motor
and I'm going to test this pH you know
why do Lee we want to be we want to have
an acidic mix in this pot and we want it
to be either one or between four and a
half six would be nice anywhere in that
range will be nice
so this is my
soil test made it it's my pH made it
and it initially sets out at seven which
is a
which is a neutral position and then if
it goes up if the number goes up
what's in this pot alkaline if the
number goes down what's in these parts
acidic okay let's see which way it goes
oh it's shut down
four it's down to four three point five
it's actually registering law all right
mate let's clean this off try it again
6.56 5.55
so that's a pH of five
I'll just clean the probe we'll give it
another go
I hope you can see this sometimes the
light reflects from the back from the
face of the pH miter becomes like a
mirror you don't actually say anything
that's why I'm not pointing it directly
at the camera all right well let's drop
the five again
4.5
okay 4.5 and 5. that's two readings
let's try this
seven six point five six five point five
five
yeah so it's definitely an acidic mix
and it's down in the region of
4.54 it's down in the region of four to
five point five I would think let's try
another
while this is settling out let me tell
you a tale um I was down the seashore
earlier this week
um and I had the candle with me that's
settling out it
4.54
[Music]
um I was down the seashore earlier this
week
um and I had the camera with me I shot
some video I'll just keep popping this
in the new coup
looking at those readings while I tell
you the tail
um
yeah and I shot some video and it was a
video of
Two Little Birds on a rock
okay and The Rock was in the Irish sea
and on that particular deer
the Irish state was very rough
those waves crashing all around
uh tide was coming in and the water was
getting deep around these two little
birds perched on this rock
[Music]
uh and to be honest
it looked like a life or death situation
it really did it looked like a life or
death situation
the waves were cashing
two birds were standing clearly well out
of the depth
um but I kept the camera roll in
the birds were clearly out of the depth
[Music]
with cashing all around
and then in a flash two birds were gone
[Music]
it's all on the video okay I'll tagging
on at the end of this and we'll call
call it a day on this
um
I think what we've got from this is that
um
this compost is definitely acidic
and I would say it's about
four to five
on the pH scale
[Music]
um
so we're down where we want to be really
perhaps a bit lower
but we are where we are
if I'd wanted to
um raise the pH of this compost I'll do
that by adding lime
but it's it's clearly too loud in the
air now that's something that needs to
be done in autumn
and if I added lime now it's something
you just don't do when you're planting
potatoes you don't add lime the ad lime
in the winter months to modify your pH
so it's too late for this year
uh but at the back end of this growing
season we'll add some lime to this
compost because I will be recycling it
okay so I hope you've enjoyed this video
um and I hope you enjoyed the little
clip of video that's going to follow now
it's his own grown veg
signing out
all right
