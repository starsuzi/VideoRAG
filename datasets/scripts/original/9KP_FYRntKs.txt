this is a 6x8 blue general purpose rip
stop tar the PVC pipe is 6 ft long 1 in
schedule 40 PVC the short piece on top
is 12 in Long 1 in schedule 40 PVC the
Boom is 4 1/2 ft long 1 in schedule 40
[Music]
PVC bottom baton is an old fishing rod
and I used the gorilla grip glue to make
the seam on
it lower portion the mass base it's
itself the masked holder is made out of
two
sections of a 2 in by 3 in wood with a
thicker piece of board that I just found
and uh drill a hole in it with the uh
whole saw it's an inch and a half hole
new you want it to fit right over the
edges of the can move and lash it down I
used the ey ring holders to so you can
tie it to
boom is held on by a little eyet screw I
drilled into the PVC pipe It just fits
right over top of the eyet and I run a
rope through
[Music]
[Applause]
it
[Music]
I use a little duct tape wrap it a few
times around there to get it a better
tighter fit so there's not Soo much
wobble in
[Music]
[Applause]
it
sh
and cut you some Eng and 1/2 pipe about
2 and 1/2 ft
[Music]
long and R up the bottom where you're
going to place the
blocks that'll help the fiberglass stick
better
for
now that we've drilled out the holes
it's time to attach the eyebolts we'll
use these to hold down the motor mount
use a nice piece of rope lash it down
real
tight these particular eye bolts come
with the nut in a package they're 316
intimes 1 and 1/2 in
zinc I paid about about $6 for all the
materials if you can find a 2x4 you can
cut that down by half I guess they're
pretty easy to
find and I bought the cheap spray paint
the dollar
special and the eyebolts with their nuts
and I'm using lock nut washers with them
too we about
$2
and then I got the world's greatest work
chair it's a bucket with a old towel
folded up on top of it cost is about
nothing makes a nice chair
though I can't wait to get this thing
out on the water and do some catfishing
looks to me like it's acting as a brace
too to even make it a little more
structurally sound there on the
hole yep won't be so much paddling for
me now of course I'll bring the paddle
use it
occasionally let's stick a screwdriver
through the eyebolt and hold it where I
want it and then tighten it
down screwdriver keeps the eyebolt
firmly in place while you tighten it
down yeah fits right down on there so
now it's time for the paint job going to
paint it white just like the
canoe
if you got some nice wood you could
stain it it' probably look pretty nice
okay there you got the finished
product hey Brett ready for another
adventure we're using our sail today
it's going to help broaden our range
here we're going to sail down in using
the trolling motor just as a
Rudder right now it's not
on but it keeps us on course here and
the wind's blowing us down wind just do
down
wind get down there and he'll start
fishing probably use our trolling motor
and our paddle to get back but right now
as it is we don't have to paddle lick
not a single
one now we going to paddle and sail at
the same time it really adds some speed
to your paddling I'll tell you this is
fun
