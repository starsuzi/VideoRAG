in this demonstration you will see how
outdoor fabrics in general and sunbrella
fabric in particular resists water our
cushion fabrics can be left outside in
the rain without any harm coming to them
as you can see most of the water is
repelled from the surface of the fabric
however if you leave the cushions out in
a prolonged rainfall they will
eventually saturate as shown here when I
rub the water into the fabric this is
not a problem the fabric and the fill
will eventually dry without harm
we suggest removing cushions from the
furniture and standing them on their
edge in a sunny area with plenty of
ventilation to help them drive faster we
also have a product available on our
website that will completely waterproof
your cushions if that's what you want
