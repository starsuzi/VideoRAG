Namaste. My name is Neelima Mittal
Cucumber Tomato Sandwich
Ingredients
Cucumber - 1 (cut in small pieces)
For making sandwiches of 4 bread slices, this will be more than enough
Tomatoes - 2 medium sized (cut in small pieces)
We have peeled the cucumber and cut it in small pieces
We have removed the seed portion of tomatoes and cut them in small pieces
4 teaspoon tomatoes and same amount of cucumber is enough for 4 slices
We can add black pepper and salt in this
1/4 tsp black pepper (or as you like) and salt to taste
I have already added salt and pepper
We will apply little butter on the bread
Switch on the gas
Switch on the sandwich maker so that it gets preheated
We have kept the flame on low
Slightly melt the butter and rub it on bread slice
I am applying very little butter
We want to apply butter evenly and in very less quantity
That's why I am melting the butter like this
Apply butter on all the bread slices
I have done it on 4
Put Cucumber and Tomato mixture on the side which does not have butter
Cover it with other slice. Side which does not have butter will remain inside
Make all the sandwiches like this before we roast them
We will now put them in sandwich maker
Remember that the sides where we have applied butter will be outside
Sandwich maker has shut automatically so it's ready
Colour is just right
You can decide how crispy you want as per your taste
This has taken about 2 minutes
Separate the pieces with a knife
Tasty and healthy Cucumber and Tomato  Sandwiches are ready
