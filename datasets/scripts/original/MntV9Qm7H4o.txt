fried up salmon
patties we make some Mexican cornbread
we got some
crazy soy
beans and some good
old
yummy here let me get this spoon out
show y'all my cream
potatoes cream
potatoes now some people think Salmon's
nasty it's
not it's
good okay now I buy it in the big
can this one right here is double CU but
I'll buy I don't care what kind it is
it's a fish is a fish is a fish okay I'm
going to drain this down the
sink so what I do is I drain the liquid
down the sink I pour the salmon in my
bowl okay then let me move to here so
y'all can
see um then I take my
can and when you look at this salmon and
you pull it apart let me get over here
close to y'all and just show you cuz
some of y'all have never even made it
Lord we grew up eating it we grew up on
it let me move my cookbook out of the
way it's going to have fish on it but
look at how it looks it's got skin on it
when you pull it
apart it's got bones on the inside
okay so what you do is you take that row
of
Bones and I throw them in my
can and I take the skin throw it in my
can now some people cook all of that I
don't so I just take my hands and kind
of Smash It Up throw this in the trash
go wash your
hands if you've got I will tell you this
if you got soap in your kitchen which
most of you do buy lemon sended soap
make sure you get a pretty good brand
now you can get soft soap lemon and it
smells really good it's good and strong
May lemon works even better I know
because me and Chris fish all the time
we got our hands in fish and shrimp and
all that stuff when we're out on the
boat and nothing cuts that smell on your
hands like lemon
does um anyway okay so let me get my
cookbook let's make these exactly like
it says in my
cookbook it
says your salmon your green onions
minced a raw
egg so we're using our onions instead of
green onions cuz I didn't have any green
onions you can always use what you got
okay and if you don't have that use
dehydrated onions and if you don't have
those use onion powder just use what
what you
got look most of my recipes are not full
of all this crap that you got to go buy
at the grocery store that you never
heard of most of my recipes are going to
have stuff in them that you got in your
counter that you already have in your
refrigerator um I don't use a lot of
special stuff now there's a few spices
that I really like but they're just
plain old regular type stuff it ain't
nothing special
all right an
egg half a teaspoon of salt and a/4
teaspoon of
pepper this is
a/4
teaspoon boy I smell that cornbread
already y'all
qu teaspoon of
pepper half a teaspoon of
salt half a cup of self-rising flour
everybody's like why do you use self
rising cuz I love
it and if you don't have some go get you
some of
it
call it's
good all
right and eight cup of cornmeal you're
probably thinking good Lord is that all
the cornmeal you going to put in there
yep I use more flour than cornmeal y'all
they're so good too I had somebody make
these and they really liked
them eight cup of cornmeal
I don't have an eigh cup so I'm just
going to put in half of that all
right that's
it so we're just going to take a fork
and mix it
up the egg is what binds everything
together so it is pretty
dry but not real dry I'll show yall when
I get done
cuz this is a whole can of salmon you
know not a little bitty half
can but the tall can oh my gosh it
smells so good to me I'm so
hungry got to have something fried most
of the time most of the time I have at
least I have one thing fried now I don't
always have one thing fried but most the
time if I do there's one thing not two
things
so if I fry up potatoes I don't fry up
my meat if I fry up my meat I don't fry
up potatoes or okra or squash does that
make
sense put some grease in there I
probably put I put a little good bit
because I like for it to get I like for
the salmon to get
brown my salmon is pretty thick you know
and I like for it to get nice and golden
brown on top and
bottom here we go once it gets good and
hot you're just going to drop them
in I take my hand like this that's just
how I cook y'all and I drop them
[Applause]
in
SC them
over now you can move these around now
if it was okra or squash or something
like that you couldn't move it for
nothing you don't touch it and you don't
flip it you got to be patient let it get
good and Brown y'all need to go back and
watch some of my videos on how to fry up
okra and squash and stuff like
that cuz a lot of people
lose their batter and stuff there's
reasons for
that get a sloted
spoon I'm just going to use the one I
used when I was putting them in
here now they're going to start turning
brown nice and golden brown and you're
going to flip it okay I think that's the
first one I put in so you're going to
try to go in order of how you put them
in there don't start just flipping them
make sure you start in order with the
first one so that they're nice and gold
Brown if you don't then if we flip this
one first it wouldn't be pretty and
brown
okay so do it that way so we're going to
go in a
row and that way it'll give them time to
get a little more Brown as we go in the
circle
see how pretty they
are mine are fluffy kind of and um I put
just enough grease in there that it kind
of comes up over the edges when they're
frying and that way they get brown on
the sides too
y'all you come here to
me and they don't poppy or nothing which
is nice
there's nothing in them full of water or
nothing that's going to pop you when
they're
hot nice and pretty and
fluffy this ain't working to take them
out I'm going up catching this thing on
fire and y'all know I've been known to
do
it I just ain't done it on live
video I just throw it
in
salt
pepper
butter
sour
cream if you put too much sour cream in
your potatoes it makes them sour so you
got to be careful with it baked potato
it's not like that I can put a ton on
there and it be good well you can that's
true but for some reason with cream
potatoes it just don't work that way
another thing that's really good and I
need to make
some is to roast some garlic uh like a
clove of garlic cuz roasted garlic is
not as strong and then put it down in
there just kind of squeeze it in there
let it drop down in your potatoes oh my
gosh my brother told me about that trick
now it's time to taste them and see if
they're good never serve anything unless
you taste
it now Nana Cooks it till it's hard as a
raw so I might slide it in there a few
more minutes till Chris gets home but I
just wanted y'all to see how pretty it
is sounds like he's
home he must have a
radar
look y'all see how pretty it looks I
don't know if y'all can see that in that
crazy light or not let me move
it it's really really good crisy ready
to eat or you want me to put this back
in the
oven and let it get real hot I mean let
it get real
Brown no mexic
cornbow
