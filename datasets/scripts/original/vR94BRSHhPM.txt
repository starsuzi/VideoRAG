chef buck here and today we're gonna
cook up some liver, apologies in
advance, but not really 'cause liver is awesome
look at that
If you think liver is scary look at this
green cutting board
now that's truly frightening this looks
like something from the set of a Freddy
Krueger movie but it's actually a super
nutritious and delicious ingredient that
you can use for a very basic liver and
onions recipe... usually if you don't see
it in the meat case you can buy in the
frozen section
this was previously
frozen you know but I just bought it
from the meat case already thawed out
and I like seeing it in the meat case cause I
can see how thick the cuts are and I
like a nice thick cut of liver you want
to buy it
deveined and there's sometimes
a silver skin on the outside of
the liver but if you buy it deveined
you usually don't have to fool with that
although you might find a chewy piece in
here but liver cooks up super fast it's a very basic recipe that
I'm gonna do today I'm just gonna heat
up a skillet on medium heat
throw a little bit of oil in here and
get that nice and hot ...one thing I like
to do before I bread my liver is cut it into some more manageable
sizes it just makes it easier to handle
I'm gonna go ahead and throw a little
seasoning on here just a little bit of
pepper and  put salt garlic
powder, whatever you want and you don't
even have to season it too fancy-pants I'm
gonna put a little bit of Chipotle on
here too
just for the heck of it now this is all
I'm gonna use to bread my liver
and I'm not even really gonna bread it
so this is just a super-duper light
coating of flour I'm just gonna throw it
down then I'm gonna put
the seasoned side down .... I'm using almond flour but you
can use whatever kind of flour you like
.... my mother always used
regular wheat flour but I'm
trying to be all cool and hip with the
cool kids
so not a lot of flour on here at all
you know I'd hardly call this breaded
I'm
going to put a little more seasoning on
this side now ...a little reckless
with it so I get some in the skillet because
I'm gonna put my onions in here
afterwards now if you wanted to you
could cook up your onions
beforehand but I like doing the liver
first then having a little bit of flavor
from that liver in the skillet now the
one thing with liver is you don't want
to overcook it
it'll cook up super fast so I'm gonna do
about two minutes on one side and then
flip it over and do two minutes on the
other side .... approximately
depending on the size of your liver
but you want it to be a little pink in
the middle if you can although if it's
not pink in the middle that's alrighty
but definitely don't overcook it because it'll get tough
Has it been 2 minutes?... look how
meaty this look you know it's very
steak-like, and it's super duper
cheap... cheap, nutritionist, tasty.... you just got to get over that liver stigma
there was a time when liver was a
very popular dish ...Idid a couple of
minutes on this side
and look super duper bueno I'm gonna
pull out these pieces first and I'll let
these two here go for maybe 20 or 30
more seconds cause they're thicker
I'll pull these off and put them on the paper towel and now while my oil is
still hot and it's got that super duper
liver flavor in there I'm gonna
throw some onions in here and this
is a lot of onions but you're gonna want
a lot of onion....
these are really gonna cook down I have
I've had my skillet on medium the whole time, but  I'm
going to reduce the heat
just a little bit go ahead and stir
these onions around get them covered in
this oil and that liver flavor and 
seasoning I put in the skillet and
you can add more seasoning if you like
and this is the most time-consuming part
of the dish so it's probably gonna take
about eight or ten minutes to get these
onions soften up you know you don't have
to caramelize them
but you want them
to cook down a little bit so they're
nice and soft so I'll let these onions
cook down about ten
minutes
...they look perfecto to me
they're definitely softened up quite a
bit and this was four medium
sized onions so it's a lot of onion, now
I'm gonna take my liver
and it's still warm but I'm gonna
throw it in the skillet just for a
second ... like I said
you know you could cook the onions first
and then just do the liver
boom-boom-boom I like to cook the onions
after the liver that way I can get that flavor from the skillet in on
the onion...and that's all there is to it...
just toss it with the onions and we can plate
this bad boy up ....you want to
distribute your onions evenly so nobody
feels left out oops I didn't do a very
good job, but I guess I'll get the plate with
the most onions... I mean that seems fair...I cooked it
my momma always serve up liver and
onions with rice or mashed potatoes but
we're just serving this up with a little
veggie sides... look how super this is
you don't have to be
scared of the liver
liver is your friend
see if you can find some liver under those onions
I gave her the most onions
...turns out I'm a great boyfriend
man I
can't believe we got two plates of this
stuff here for about three bucks...super duper melt in your mouth man
there's just a little hint of pink in
there...you don't have to
cook it all the way through
just don't overcook it because it'll
turn into shoe leather .... people have
been eating liver since the dawn of time
it's
such an important ingredient especially
for our early man
I mean Native Americans ate liver all the time
they used to call it maize ... I'll have to check...

commercial?... if you want to print
