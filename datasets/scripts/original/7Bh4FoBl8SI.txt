okay family I'm going to show you guys
how to make some quick hot water
cornbread now to make this dish here you
simply need a little bit of sugar this
is about a good maybe close to a
tablespoon of
sugar um also I have um about a teaspoon
of
salt and I have um just some basic
cornmeal okay so what we're gonna
do is add some cornmeal into
this I'm not really measuring so you
know you guys just simply be the judge
on how much you're cooking or
whatever
so see that looks to be about I want to
say about maybe two cups that looks to
be about maybe two cups or so we're
going to add a little bit of sugar
we're going to add some
salt now the water the key to this thing
is having boiling hot water this is
where the term hot water cornbread come
from so you want to just add just a
little bit of
water at a
time
and the consistency you want is more
like
Play-Doh because you want it to be able
to form it into
little like pancakes like like little
muffin so add a little bit more
water and I'm using the back of my fork
okay and we're just kind
of clean that off the edges a little
bit I'm going to add just a little bit
more over here on this
end
that should be about enough now also
when you're doing this be mindful that
you might not want to use a plastic bowl
and stuff like that because this water
is scalling hot water boiling hot water
so it is best if you're going to do this
is to use
um a silver bowl just one more little
smidget cuz we want it pliable we want
it to be able to work
with my hands now you want to have your
canola oil already doing its thing on to
the side okay so now just be mindful
that this is very hot okay but from
cooking a lot you know your hands you
know get a little tolerance for heat so
heat doesn't bother you so much when
you're used
to you know messing with heating
elements and things so anyway so you
just want to make a little ball let's
get make them a little bit more proper
than that how about that you know make
them real proper yeah like Mama used to
make them how about that y'all let's
make them real nice and proper and what
the cold water does not only does it
cool it down but it also makes it where
as you can form it into whatever you
want
so now once you do that we're going to
set it inside of the
skillet okay family this is the way in
which your hot water cornbread should
look once finished again you only only
add hot water no dairy product okay so
you're using hot water you're using salt
you using a little little little tiny
bit of sugar for Taste and your cornmeal
you're going to Patty it up you're going
to use a little cold ice cold water to
form your your your little circles like
this and you're going to put it in some
hot canola that's it and that's all you
guys take care I love you guys good
