my name is volia venko and today I'm
going to show you how to make an
excellent green smoothie I'm going to go
over the basic principles of making
every smoothie taste good so that you
never make an awful one again so green
smoothies are made out of greens and
fruits right so I have here some spinach
so I'm going to put some spinach right
into this
blender a little
more and for fruit I'm just going to use
this apple
here I always take out the stem because
the stem is a very Woody part of the
apple and it doesn't blend
up but you can leave the seeds of the
Apple even though some people say the
seeds have cyanide um in small amounts
those chemicals are actually good for
the body and explode cancer cells we
have the fruit we have the
greens so we put some water in
there all right let's blend it
[Music]
up so this is how not to make a smoothie
notice that the particles are all
quickly moving to the bottom and we've
got a nice layer of foam on top which
usually has a very strong chlorophyll
flavor it's separating it's going to be
chunky lumpy fibrous foamy watery and
tasting like straight grass to make a
good smoothie you have to know the
difference between the two fibers that
exist there are two types of fiber
soluble fiber and insoluble fiber
insoluble fiber is the fiber that we
make fabric out of and weave rope out of
it's what our clothes are made out of
and greens are a very rich source of
insoluble fiber now to make the Smoothie
creamy we need to use the soluble fiber
that's the creamy fiber the fiber that
will suspend all the particles and make
a delicious texture also it'll make the
flavor sweeter and more fruit likee
masking the strong chlorophyll taste so
what are some fruits that are rich in
soluble fiber bananas are rich in
soluble fiber so are pears and
Kiwis strawberries are rich in soluble
fiber as well as papayas peaches mangoes
are the king of fiber actually mangoes
have both soluble and insoluble fiber
and the fiber is really good for the
heart for cleaning the heart arteries
and taking out toxins from the body so
you have to include at least one kind of
soluble fiber in every smoothie so in
this smoothie I'm going to put a
banana put a banana in there and I'm
going to put some

mango
I'm also going to use a slice of pear
about half half of a
pear and finally just a few strawberries
also you can leave the greens of the
strawberries on the berry because
they're edible and this is a green
smoothie so we might as well add some
more greens to
it now let's see what happens when we
blend this
up
[Music]
now look at this smoothie it's got a
creamy texture the particles are not
sinking to the bottom we've eliminated
the foam and it smells like fruit it
smells delicious it also tastes
delicious this is going to be a very
delicious smoothie for anybody an
important note is to pour it into a
pretty
glass
food that is presented in a palatable
fashion tends to taste better actually
statistically speaking so we're going to
dress this up and make it look
outstanding maybe with a slice of
kiwi like
that
and let put a little bit of
strawberry on there like this
so here we have a beautiful green
smoothie that also tastes
delicious who could say no to
