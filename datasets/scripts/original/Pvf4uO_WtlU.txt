hey y'all this is Adam Cochran from
Broadhead Kentucky I'm recording today
show you my beautiful
finds from Southern
California a lot of
these have a nice shine on
them but they all
not all of them take a
shine like this
one this must be some sort of
agot didn't tumble so
well oh
well
happens
folks this one came out really nice
that's a red moss
agot now all of these
rocks I'm showing today are from Nyland
California oh that's
beautiful uh
is
beautiful
it's
hot this one's
nice
wow this one's not as good
but at least it has a shine to
it this is a
fortification
OT it's been bleached by the sun sitting
in the desert for so many
years that's just awesome how the
Sun got rid of all the color there must
have been color in there once upon a
time as a crystal
Center
