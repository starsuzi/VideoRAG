hi guys I'm Laur Vali and on this
episode of Laur in the kitchen I'm going
to show you how to make a Padova a
Padova has been requested here in Laur
in the kitchen for so so long I debited
making it because the recipes for it I
mean they're all pretty much the same
but since you guys are all so excited
and constantly asking for it I thought
you know I'm going to bring it to you
it's one of my favorite desserts and uh
it's easy let me take you over the
ingredients so we can get started you're
going to need some egg whites some plain
old granulated sugar some corn starch
white wine vinegar vanilla extract and
cream of tartar now that is those are
just the ingredients you're going to
need to make the base the mering part
and then in a little bit we'll bring out
a few extra ingredients for the topping
that's just going to make this
outrageously delicious now the first
thing want to do is get your oven
preheated to 300° fah the second thing
you want to do is you take some a piece
of parchment paper and what I've done is
I've taken an 8 in plate or the bottom
of a pie plate whatever you have that is
8 in round and I've just traced it with
a pencil so then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to flip it over because I
don't want my mering base to touch the
pencil but now I can see it and that's
going to be my guide to making sure that
this is the right shape right on so in
my electric mixer you can do this by
hand um I will suggest not to unless you
want to give yourself a nervous
breakdown because this is going to take
a lot of time to whip up so in here I
have my egg
white and I'm going to let those get
foamy it'll just take a second up until
I can just start to see little
bubbles just going to add in a pinch of
salt and some cream of tartar now the
cream of tartar helps stabilize the egg
wh whoops I'm just going to let that mix
for just a second
going to scrape the sides just really
quickly and to make sure it gets
Incorporated
well and now that I've got that pretty
much mixed in there slowly in one
tablespoon at a time I'm going to add in
my sugar now a Padova is really just a
giant mering but the interior is just
chewy marshmallow likee consistency
that's absolutely addictive the texture
of Pavlova is done correctly is
unbeatable and it's truly something that
is beautiful to look at as it is
delicious so that's what we're going to
make today and now just little by little
I'm going to add my sugar and I'm going
to continue to whisk this until it
becomes super thick and white and the
sugar has dissolved and I'll show you
what that looks like once we're
there now that is a gorgeous mering look
at that it's nice and thick and if you
take some of it and do the like that you
don't feel any of the sugar granules
that's when you know you're at the right
stage so I want you to take this beater
and I want you to just dot your baking
sheet
because that way your parchment
paper doesn't go anywhere when you're
trying to spread out the rice of the
mering see doesn't go anywhere all right
so now let's take this from a mering to
Pavlova and the Magical ingredients for
that is some corn starch or in some
countries it's called corn flour in the
US we call it corn
starch just a drop of white wine vinegar
and I know this sounds crazy but that is
what makes a pavlova a
pavlova and some
vanilla and I'm just going to take my
spatula and just fold this all together
very
quickly because I don't want to deflate
those beautiful egg whites
put this in the
center just like
that see why it's important to have your
little 8 in circle drawn outside that
way you can see it and you don't flatten
it out too too much because then you
won't get like a really thick gorgeous
Pavlova it'll be really really thin so
now I would just want you to make the
Border a little bit thicker than the
center and I just take my
spatula and and I just make it nice and
smooth around the edges and then trying
to smooth in the center that is gorgeous
and perfect and now I want you to put
this into the oven at 300° for 50
minutes 5 not five not 51 minutes 50
minutes and then I want you to turn the
oven off open the oven door just a
little bit and let it cool completely
for about 2 to three hours you can even
do it overnight if you want to and I'm
going to show you what it looks like
once it's there
my Pavlova baked and I've let it cool in
the oven completely and now we're going
to move on to the whipped cream part now
in my mixer I have some heavy whipping
cream and I'm going to just whip that up
with some confectioner
sugar and while that's happening I'm
just taking some strawberry preserves
you can use whatever kind of preserves
you like and I'm going to just warm this
up in a little
saucepan oops with just squeeze of fresh
orange juice and I'm just heating this
up until it becomes nice and runny and
like that I can kind of spoon it you
know and can drizzle it over the top so
while that's happening and that's
working I want that to work faster
though I'm going to invert my pav Loa
now every time I make pav Loa I can
never just get it off the parchment
paper I've tried everything it doesn't
work so what I do is I just put it
upside down on a cake stand so
that flip it and it does crack
but there we
go any paoa I've ever made any paoa I've
ever eaten cracks so you can either
leave these on here or you can do what I
do is I take them out all the little
cracked pieces and I save those for
myself and I'll snack on
them top it with your whipped cream
you can put as much or as little as you
want really
but I like to really pile it
high don't worry I'm not going to get
rid of that so
then take your berries you can use one
kind of berries you can use a mixture of
berries you can use a different kind of
fruit kiwi is really delicious on
Pavlova uh passion fruit is fantastic I
can't find any passion fruit here but
when I do then that's what I use I use
the pulp of the passion fruit and if it
runs down that is totally a
okay and I just spoon some of my
jam and orange mixture on
top okay that's good for
now now obviously you wouldn't want to
cut into it before you bring it to your
guest you know for dessert but I got to
show you what the inside looks like
it's just I couldn't be making any more
noise today if I
tried look at that look at that mering
base that is just amazing holds together
beautifully you can even see it right
here see that holds together perfectly
that soft whipped cream you don't want a
whipped cream super like whipped and
becomes butter you want it to be nice
soft peaks
you couldn't get a more delicious Pavo
though it's not difficult to make a
little timec consuming but you're not
doing anything to it it's in the oven
for a while and then it's cooling off
for some more time and you get to really
reap the benefits of this
one make this for your next get together
