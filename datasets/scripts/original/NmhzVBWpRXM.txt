hello I'm Marsha wind Beckler and my
husband Roland I own cakes supplies
plus.com we're professional cake
decorating instructors and we've
appeared on the Food Network in TLC's
ultimate cake
off I want to show you how easy it is to
make modeling chocolate and all you're
going to need is I have a pound of uh
guitard baking chips here and they make
several different versions this
particular one has Coco butter in it it
makes the best uh White modeling
chocolate the um unfortunately it's kind
of hard to find these in small
quantities we have them on our website
uh cakes supplies plus.com in bulk 25 lb
bulk but um you can also use white candy
coating and this is a merkens uh that's
packaged by CK products it's available
on our website you also need some kind
of a rubber type spatula this is a
silicone coated spatula and for each
pound of your candy you're going to need
a half a cup of corn
syrup and the first thing I want to do
is melt my candy and I will put it in
the microw wave at uh 1 minute for the
first times stir it and then at 30second
intervals you don't want to overcook it
that will uh ruin the candy so you have
to keep checking it after each 30
seconds to make sure it's and stir it to
make sure that it uh is getting melted
and not too
hot and then once I've melted my candy I
also want to warm up my corn syrup just
to a warm temperature so that it doesn't
shock the candy when I put it in there
and make it uh firm up instantly so I'll
go get my candy melted and I'll be right
back so I have my candy melted and my
corn syrup all warmed up and I'm just
going to pour the corn syrup into the
candy
and get it all out of my measuring cup
here then I'm going to start stirring
and you want to make sure that all of
the candy gets Incorporated with the
corn syrup you don't want any pieces or
parts of
candy that don't get mixed in because
they'll make hard lumps in your modeling
chocolate if you have any candy that's
worked its way up your spatula make sure
you clean that off and get it down
Incorporated doesn't take too many uh
stirs to get this all worked together
make sure you're cleaning the bottom of
the container so you get all of the
candy work together with the corn
syrup you don't want to over mix it
that'll make the fats
separate and make it greasy and kind of
lumpy kind of ruins your modeling
chocolate and again if you've got any
chocolate that's up make sure it gets
worked down
and once you can see it getting kind of
nice and smooth don't let it separate
then I'm going to move it over onto a
some
plastic and I have some plastic wrap
here just on a with a firm cutting mat
underneath so that I have something to
lift it with and I'll just put my
botling chocolate out here on the
plastic plastic
[Music]
wrap and then all I want to do is cover
it
over on all
ends and let it
rest
overnight so once you've let your
modeling chocolate set overnight then
you just want to unwrap it
it'll be plenty
firm and you can't use it uh just right
away like this first you have to knead
it I'm going to break off a piece here
and knead up
some and I like to divide mine in
pieces and it's a little bit easier to
knead if it's in smaller pieces I'll
just take some of it here and start
kneading it it
up and you just continue to knead it
until it gets soft and pliable so once
it's all kneaded up you can see it's
nice and smooth and soft and pliable and
you can make little figures with it you
can make pieces that stand up pieces
that are arched that would stand on
their
own move it over onto a some plastic and
I have it on a cardboard here just so I
can move it
afterwards and the reason I don't have
the white Side Up is just for color
contrast so you can see what I want to
do is spread it out on this
plastic and I'm going to spread it
pretty thin so that it cools a little
bit quicker and I can start working with
it after it
cools so I'm just going to spread it out
you could do this directly on your uh
with the plastic directly on your
counter if you don't need to move it or
you could slip something under the
plastic and move it later but so once
I've got that kind of spread out I'm
going to cover it with plastic on
top and once the plastic is on top I can
spread it even thinner even take
something flat like my cutting board
here and really
get it nice and
even and having it spread out to a
thinner being thinner versus a big thick
lump it's going to cool off
faster and if you happen to have granite
countertops or a marble slab you could
put this the pl sheet of plastic
directly on that and let it cool off and
it cool off very
quickly so here's my sheet of modeling
chocolate I put it on a uh Granite
cutting board and flipped it a couple
times it only took about a half an hour
to get cool and you can see it's uh
still pliable but yet stiff and workable
so what I'm going to do is peel off my
first layer of top layer of the plastic
here plastic
wrap and turn it over on my silicone mat
peel wh
off and then I can even break it up into
pieces with my pastry cutter
here work it until it becomes
pliable knead it with your
hands so you can see it's nice and
smooth and pliable now and you can shape
it into all sorts of different
shapes it will hold its shape it'll
stand
up keeps whatever shape you want to put
it in
so once you have your modeling chocolate
nice and pliable and ready to work I'll
show you a little figure you can make
with it I'm going to make a little duck
figure
here and I'm just first going to roll it
into a
ball now to a teardrop shape I'm making
one end thinner it's going to be the
tail of the duck
then I'm going to pinch it
[Music]
up going to cut two
Wings bring that out use my pallet
knife and to add some
Little Feather lines
and now just a circle for the head and
his head is going to be kind of large in
proportion to the body so that it's kind
of like a baby duck so it kind of looks
like that right
now then I've pre-colored some
orange and I'll add him some feet and a
beak and they're basically the same
shape uh the uh
I'm going to make kind of a pointed on
one end Roundy on the other kind of
flatten it off there and then for the
feet I just want to press down kind of
square off the edge and then add the
webbed feet
look as will go right up against his
body
here for the
beak think I want a little more modeling
chocolate I will make that same shape
only a little bit larger you do have to
be careful of the weight on it though
but uh so a little bit larger again I'm
going to kind of flatten it off here but
I didn't Smash It This
Time by the way this little figure is in
my rolled buttercream book and Roland
has a whole book on uh hand modeled
figures lots of different figure shapes
that we
do and I'm just going to cut off the
back to make it a little bit larger so
it attaches to the
uh the duck figure here has a little
more surface area for
attaching
and we'll press it up against the head
here so it looks like that at this point
and then he just needs eyes and just a
couple of black circles rolled and
flattened will be his eyes and I like
them to be kind of low and close
together
low down towards his beak and kind of
close together
