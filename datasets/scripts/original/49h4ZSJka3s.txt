all right I'm gonna start to do some uh
of my delicious dill relish
recipe calls for four cucumbers or four
pounds of other cucumbers this is six so
obviously I'm doing a batch of a
basically one and a half batches so
got my jars all set up over here
it's important to have them nice and
cleaned out I'm gonna sterilize them
here
but first I gotta get a
my cucumbers chopped up no
and I'm gonna take you through this
process and show you how to make some of
the best dough relish that you'll ever
uh eat in your lifetime
okay so I got my uh
six pounds of cucumbers if
all cut up I cut like I cut the ends off
don't use them obviously as you can see
I'm using Old English cucumbers it
really doesn't matter what kind you use
just these were cheap so that's why I'm
using them
so now uh I'm doing a batch and a half
that's why I got six pounds of cucumbers
the recipe calls for four now it's time
to chop them up very finely now there's
many ways you could do that you could uh
use what I'm going to use a food
processor you could use a blender you'd
use a Slap Chop or if you're ambitious
you could do it by hand
but I'm going to do it
what's the blender here or
yeah food processor
[Music]
okay so that's how I'll be okay after a
serious brain fart
we finally remembered how we did this we
cut the Cucumbers up in slices
drop them in
the food processor
and then we just
bolster the bit
until we got a
nice little uh
shards and pieces
now that I got my cucumber all uh minced
down
and in a bowl
time to add in some recipe calls for a
quarter cup of salt but remember I'm
doing a batch and a half
so I need
a quarter cup of salt
plus roughly about
half of that
dump that in there
and then
I need
it's a lot harder with uh
holding this but anyways I'm gonna
need three quarters I need half a
teaspoon of turmeric but like I said
it's a batch and a half so I need three
quarters teaspoon of turmeric I'm just
gonna
stop this now and do that
after that I gotta mix this all up
and let it stand for one hour
now I got my turmeric and my salt in
there I'm just gonna
mix this up really good
I really like the fact that this recipe
calls
for turmeric because turmeric is
one of the super foods of the world
is super healthy
there's a lot of great things for your
body
all right that should be good enough
well I gotta let this stand for one hour
why I think it's just a
help separate some of the juices
but yeah one hour
I'll be back
okay now that uh this has been sitting
roughly about 45 minutes I've been
stirring occasionally
I'm gonna go over to the next task which
is coming up with
uh the recipe calls for a cup and a half
of minced onion but I'm doing about two
cups because I'm doing a batch and a
half
recipe also calls for four cloves of
garlic
because I'm doing a batch and a half I
gotta do six cloves but I'm actually
doing a little bit more because I'm a
fan of garlic
okay so I cut up my onion and I got my
garlic in the processor
uh the recipe doesn't necessarily say do
it all together I just prefer to do it
it's a little bit quicker and it really
doesn't matter so
yeah so now I'm gonna
mince this all up
there's one cup of onions
through we are throwing separate pot
a little bit harder to do
hold on folks
I'm gonna put this down so I could
finish my task
okay so I add a little bit more than two
cups
I have onion and garlic which is
not bad it's pretty much right on par I
wanted two cups of onion and a little
bit of the cloves of vinegar or cloves
of garlic would have put it over
so now I gotta get two cups of white
vinegar to dump in there
two cups white vinegar coming right up
now I need
some sugar
I believe a third cup of sugary
so in my case it'll be just under two
just under two thirds I've added my uh
sugar in here
I need
the recipe here calls for
two tablespoons of mustard seeds or no
sorry two teaspoons of mustard seeds and
a tablespoon of Dill seeds so I gotta go
a tablespoon half a dill speed Dill
seeds and three teaspoons of mustard
seeds because I'm doing a batch and a
half
Dill seed
sorry about the camera movement
it's trying to
get as much as I can on here
so there
tablespoon and a half of Dill seed
one
two
three teaspoons of yellow mustard seed
now I gotta stir this and bring it to a
boil
and then I'll be adding uh my cucumbers
to it
okay now that I've let my
cucumber mix
sit and settle for an hour
at uh
put it in a sieve or strainer whatever
you like to call it
and I gotta push out a lot of the juice
or the majority of the juice anyways
they say to get out
all of it
I think that's a little bit impossible
you're always going to have some so just
get it as much as you can
really it kind of doesn't matter because
you could kind of
drain out some of the water at the end
and
it's not going to hurt nothing
been letting this uh sit get all the
water out
it's just about there
so I've turned this mixture on
let's turn it up I'm gonna bring it to a
boil
once it's boiling
I'll proceed to
add the cucumbers to it
bring it to a boil again
and keep it at a slow constant boil for
about 30 minutes stirring
ever so occasionally
then after that it'll be ready for the
jars
okay I've added the Cucumber mix oh
there's a big piece of cucumber in there
oh I'll save uh that pull it out when
it's nice and
Dilly and I'll eat it just as is
a few little
some bigger pieces in there but
that doesn't concern me
as a scope Cooks on and on and just
starts to smell a lot better and
I like to eat piece of those bigger
pieces anyway so
that's what she looks like right now
gotta bring her to the bring her to a
boil again
much well as you see it's not gonna take
long
and then I gotta let it boil for about
30 minutes
until it's uh
pretty much a bit thicker quite a bit
thicker actually
so the juice is thickened and
you get the consistency that you like
it's nicely bubbling away
while it's doing that I uh took time to
clean up I like to
try to clean up as I go do things as I
go
and if I'm unable to do so because I get
maybe flustered or caught up doing other
things an awesome partner my wife that
will help me in that general area
for a first time only I'm going to show
you
the exact
recipe for this for the dill pickle
relish
so I hope you can see this
calls for four pounds cucumbers
quarter cup of salt
half teaspoon of turmeric
two cups white sugar
a third cup sugar
or sorry two cups white vinegar and
third cup of sugar
four cloves minced garlic
one tablespoon of Dill seeds one tea or
two teaspoons of mustard seeds one and a
half cup finely chopped onions
the reactions are as follows
grind cucumbers in a large bowl and
sprinkle with salt and turmeric
stir in one cup cold water
let's stand for an hour
stirring occasionally I don't usually do
the one cup cold water
thing it just
to me it adds more water to it but
this is drain a large sieve
rinse under cold water strain again
pressing sorry for the interruption ran
out of memory
but yeah so
that is uh the rinsing under cold water
that's optional I don't really do that
but then it says in a pan bring vinegar
sugar
garlic Dill seed Mustard Seed all to a
boil
and add cucumbers and onions
although I do it differently I actually
add the onions into the boiling process
first and add cucumbers return to boil
stirring occasionally until thickened
about 30 minutes
jar them up and seal them up process
bathe them
yeah so there you go first time I don't
usually uh give out my recipes but there
you go
all right so it's all done
now it's time
to fill the jars up
and I already know this tastes great
I've already had my taste test
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Laughter]
and just like that
jar number one
a few more to go
oh there you go ladies and gentlemen
one medium jar
seven small jars
and I got a taste of it
definitely because there's a tiny bit in
there
tastes perfect
just waiting for uh Lids to boil
so once the lids boil I'll let them boil
for about a minute
put them on the jar
put the rings on ever so
firmly not tight but firm
once they're all on
I'll put them in for their bath
leave them in there about 10 minutes
that way it seals the lids prevents any
seals them really good and prevents any
kind of bacteria or anything like that
from forming or getting in there
and then uh so once they've been in
there 10 minutes I'll
send them out let them cool down and
they're ready to go ready to be stocked
and put away we're ready to be eaten
however you want
and that concludes this lesson for today
I've had a few people want me to do uh
my dill relish so
there you go I hope you guys all uh
enjoyed this video I hope you guys uh
definitely try to make this visit the
recipe it's fantastic once you eat this
still relished you won't go back to
I don't go back to any Relish in the
store so
it's that good
but hopefully uh
you guys give this a try out and enjoy
it
