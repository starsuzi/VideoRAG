Hi Bold Bakers!
When I was reading through your comments,
trying to decide what the next Big and Bold
episode would be, I saw that you requested
beignets a lot.
Very similar to a donut, it’s traditionally
a fried treat, however, we are going to do
our own big and bold version, and make it
baked.
So let’s get started.
A lot of people know beignets from the famous
Café du Monde restaurant in New Orleans.
They serve them morning, noon, and night,
piled high with icing sugar.
I have never been there, but I have been to
Disneyland, where they also serve them, shaped
like Mickey.
We are going to make it today.
It’s really easy.
It’s a yeasted dough that can all be mixed
by hand.
We are going to start out by mixing up our
yeast.
So in a jug we are going to add in some blood
temperature water.
You can always check if it’s blood temperature
because you can put your finger in it, and
if you don’t feel the water around it, it’s
blood temperature.
You need that warmth in the water to help
the yeast grow.
Into the water, scatter over your dried yeast.
Any type of dried yeast you have at home is
totally fine.
I love that smell.
I love the smell of fermenting, and yeast,
and bread-making.
It’s my favorite.
And just go in and stir it up, and get that
yeast to dissolve.
Yeast feeds on sugar and will help our dough
to rise, so in a few minutes you’ll probably
see this mix actually foaming up a little
bit.
We’re going to set this mix aside for five
minutes and continue with the rest of our
ingredients.
For this next step, you want to have a large
bowl because we are going to mix and proof
our dough in the same bowl, so you want to
give a lot of room.
So we’re going to crack in an egg, add in
some vanilla, salt for flavor, always salt
in dough is important, and then some evaporated
milk.
So I looked at a lot of recipes, and most
of them require evaporated milk.
I think it’s because of a little sweetness
and creaminess, so be sure you add that in.
And then just give this mix a little whisk
up together.
So into these wet ingredients, we’re going
to add in our yeasted mix.
Now I want you to have a little look at the
top here.
You see that foam?
That means that the yeast is alive, so we’re
just going to pour that straight into this.
Give that a bit of a whisk-y whisk.
Now next we’re going to add in some melted
butter.
Now the important thing about adding in melted
butter is make sure that it’s at room temperature,
you don’t want it too hot, or else it will
set on top of your wet ingredients.
So melt it when you first stop making your
beignets, and it’ll be good to go.
So keep whisking and pour that in there.
Lovely.
We’re almost done with our dough.
The next thing we have to do is add in our
flour.
So we’re just going to add in half of it.
Don’t ever be afraid of working with yeasted
dough.
It is the easiest thing to do.
And lots of times you can mix them by hand,
just like these ones.
And just stir that in until you get a really
wet, soggy dough.
Okay we have our nice, soggy, wet dough here,
and then go ahead and add in the rest of your
flour.
And then just mix it in with a spatula or
a wooden spoon until your dough starts to
come together.
One thing I like about this dough is that
it’s fast, and that you can mix it by hand.
Bring your dough as best you can with your
spatula, but you get to a point where you
just have to get stuck in with your hand,
and bring it all together.
I always find it easier to work with your
hands with dough, because then you know what’s
going on, you know if you’ve added too much
liquid, if you need a little bit more—you
just find out straight away.
And bread dough, and yeasted dough, is a more
of a kind of hands-on type of technique anyway.
Just give it a quick little knead into the
bowl until it comes together and there’s
no dry bits left.
No matter what kind of dough or pastry you
are making, one really easy way to tell if
you’re on the right path is if you have
a nice dough at the end, and a clean bowl.
A clean bowl always means you’re on the
right track.
So you will notice that this beignet dough
is a tiny bit sticky.
That’s the nature of it.
We are gonna pop it back in the same bowl
that we mixed it in.
To let it proof, we’re going to tightly
cover it with some cling wrap, making sure
no air gets in there, and then we are going
to lay a tea towel on top, and this keeps
it nice and warm during the proofing stage.
So now what we’re going to do is set aside
our dough for two hours and let it proof.
You want to see it double in size, and then
we’re ready to use it.
So it’s been two hours and if you take a
little peek at our dough, it has doubled in
size.
It is absolutely beautiful.
This is why I love working with yeasted doughs
because in a little amount of time, you can
see your recipe working and growing.
These are going to make beautiful beignets.
Dust your countertop with a little bit of
flour, to stop your dough from sticking.
And then gently turn out your dough.
Sprinkle a little bit of flour on your rolling
pin to stop it sticking, and then we’re
going to roll it out gently to around a quarter
of an inch thick.
I want my beignets nice and thick.
Give it a little bit of a move around your
countertop to make sure it’s not sticking.
I get a lot of questions about what are important
kitchen tools to have and I always say a ruler,
because I use this nearly every time I go
into the kitchen, so invest in a ruler.
Another important piece of kitchen equipment
is a pizza roller, and that’s how we’re
going to cut our beignets.
We’re going to cut around an inch by an
inch square.
That’s a good bite-sized piece for a beignet.
So I like to cut all of my lines across first,
and then I go up.
And then you start to see your squares forming.
Beignets are traditionally known for their
square shape, a little bit like a puffy pillow.
Okay, we’re going to go ahead and gently
lay these on a baking sheet lined with parchment
paper, giving each a little bit of room to
proof and to bake and to grow.
Once your beignets are all cut and on the
tray, then we’re going to have to let them
sit and proof for around 35 to 45 minutes,
and this will help us yield big, lovely puffy
beignets.
These need a little bit of time to rest and
grow.
So wrap a little bit of cling wrap around
them, and then again with your towel, just
lightly placed over.
So we’ll come back in a little bit and check
on them.
So our beignets are proofed, but I want to
show you the telltale signs of how you know
that.
So not only has it risen, and it’s nice
and soft, like you can see, if you push it
with your finger, it doesn’t bounce back.
Also the lines that you have cut have kind
of rounded out a little bit.
They’re a little bit softer.
So that’s how you can tell that it has proofed
and is ready for the oven.
So just before we put them in, I’m going
to glaze them with a little bit of milk, and
this will help them get a lovely golden brown
color in the oven.
So you might be wondering what’s the difference
between beignets and donuts, and they are
quite different.
There are different ingredients in them, so
you get a different texture in your dough,
and a bit of a different flavor.
Okie-dokie, we’re glazed, we’re proofed,
we’re ready for the oven.
Bake your beignets at 350 degree Fahrenheit
or 180 degrees Celsius, until lovely and golden
brown.
So I know I’m baking these today, but you
can fry this dough as well.
All you need is a few inches of oil in a pan,
and fry them gently until they’re lovely
and golden brown.
The timer just went off, my kitchen smells
like warm dough, so I’m pretty sure they’re
ready.
Just look at these little beignets, made from
that really easy dough.
If you can see, there’s little bubbles on
the side.
That means they’re lovely, and airy, and
soft.
I wish you guys could smell these, because
they absolutely smell divine.
So now while your beignets are still warm,
fresh out of the oven, our next step is to
coat them in a bit of butter, and then we’re
going to dust them with icing sugar.
I like to add butter for extra flavor, and
also, it gives something for the icing sugar
to stick on.
And then liberally—don’t be shy with the
icing sugar—dust your beignets.
Traditionally they are served with mounds
of icing sugar.
Beignets are best eaten freshly baked and
nice and warm, so I’m going to dip some
in some chocolate sauce that I have, and I’m
also going to serve it with some dark coffee,
just like they do in Café du Monde.
This is like a soft pillow of heaven.
Just look at that texture.
This is a lovely, buttery, airy dough that
gives you a beautiful beignet at the end.
You do not have to go as far as New Orleans
or Disneyland to enjoy these famous treats.
