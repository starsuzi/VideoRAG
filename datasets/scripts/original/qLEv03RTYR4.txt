Hi Everyone, this is Jacy from Craft Life
and I'm here today to teach you the Rainbow
Loom Basic Barefoot Sandals.
This is what we will be making.
This is what they look like.
You may have seen these on Facebook because
they are on the Craft Life page.
You may have seen these on Pinterest too.
This is what they look like when they are
finished.
Ok, the supplies you will need are the Rainbow
Loom mini loom and its tool.
I use crochet hooks, [DROP!
Clink, Clink] they won't break!
Next you will need colors, you can choose
as many colors as you want.
You can have two colors, three colors, four
colors, but I like three colors.
Today I am using black, pink and blue.
Are you ready to learn the Basic Barefoot
Rainbow Loom Sandals?
If not, pause the video, get your supplies
and get ready.
Let's start with step one.
You are going to need your mini loom, a rubber
band, and your tool.
I am using a crochet hook.
Start by placing your rubber band right here,
go around this sharp turn right there and
head back to where you started.
Let's review.
[She takes it off] You're going to start at
this one, make that sharp turn again and head
back to your start.
Ta-da!
To begin, you need to stick your hook in,
grab a rubber band, put that rubber band on
your hook, pull it through, stick it back
on.
Let's review.
Stick your hook in, take a rubber band, put
it on, pull it through, stick it back on.
Now we are going to do the next one.
Take another rubber band, put it on the hook,
pull it through that one, and put it back
on.
Take another rubber band, put it on your hook,
pull it through and stick it back on.
This is the last one that I am going to do.
You're going to pull it, put it on your hook,
pull it through, and stick it back on.
Continue this until you have reached your
certain amount for your toe.
YAY!
I finished my toe size ten rubber bands.
Hopefully you have finished your toe size
too so we can move on.
But before we do, I need to show you what
may or may not happen to you.
See how this is backwards from this?
Well you need to turn that all the way around
without twisting your rubber bands up and
to do that, you need to pinch right here,
pull this out, and turn it, so you are going
to stick your hook in that way, push it in
there.
So, you have fixed the problem.
Now it can easily go in here and we are ready
for step three.
This is step three.
To begin, you are going to stick your hook
in here and rip this off like that.
So now you have four little loops on there.
You are going to take one rubber band any
color that you have chosen and put it on your
hook just like this and pull it through these
two, stick it back on, just like that.
Now you are going to take another rubber band.
You are going to put it on your hook again,
grab your thing and pull it through, stick
it back on.
It should look like this.
Now you're forming your toe to your ankle.
And you are going to take another rubber band,
put it on, pull this through just like that,
put it back on.
Just like we did before.
You're going to continue the pattern and we
are going to take another one, put it on,
flip it over, put it in, put it back on and
this is just like we did on the toe except
we are not going to loop it over.
We are going to take another one and pull
it through and put it back on.
You are going to do this until it fits your
toe to your ankle and it needs to be fitting
on your toe and touching your ankle.
When this fits properly we will move on to
step four.
I just finished my length from my toe to my
ankle.
I used fourteen rubber bands.
You may need more or you may need less.
I forgot to tell you that you need a C clip.
It's a piece of plastic shaped like a C. Now
we are ready for step four the ankle straps.
OK, you need to know that this will be shared
by both ankle straps.
I am going to teach you how to make the first
one and then I will teach you how to make
the second one.
Let's begin.
Take a rubber band, pull it through like you
normally would.
Take another one, pull it through, put it
in.
Grab another, pull it through, put it in.
Then you are going to take another one.
Do the same thing.
Pull it through and you are going to put it
in.
So now you have four.
Take one more, pull it in, put it through.
Now you need to finish this until you have
your length.
I have one already finished since you need
to make a pair.
So I'm just going to put this one aside.
You finish yours.
I'm going to show you how to put on a C clip.
Take your C clip [drop] and pinch this right
here [drop] I find it easier to do it this
way.
Stick your C clip in between both of them
and pull it up.
So you get both of them stuck in here.
Now I'm going to teach you how to make your
second ankle strap.
From here you are going to stick your tool
in the one that is shared by both of them.
Grab a rubber band.
Pull it through.
Stick it back in.
So now you can kind of see the whole barefoot
sandal there and that's shared by both of
them.
You're going to take another one.
Pull it through, place it in.
Take another one.
Pull it through, place it in.
Take another one.
Pull it through, place it in.
And one more.
Place it in.
Ok, finish this until, well make it the same
as this one, your amount, and it should be
equal on both sides.
And then we will place this one on the C clip
too.
I hope you finished up your other ankle strap
because we are going to get ready to put it
on the C clip.
Hold your C clip and stick your finger in
there and open it up.
Take the C clip and slide it in.
Just like that.
You can pull it off and there you go!
Now you need to make another one!
I have made one.
So now I'll be right back I'm going to go
try them on.
This is what they look like when they're on!
I hope you enjoyed the tutorial on how to
make the Basic Barefoot Sandals.
