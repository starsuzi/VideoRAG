today i am going to be showing you guys
how to frost like a pro
[Music]
now guys before we begin first of all
here is a photo of the first cupcakes i
ever piped as you can see not great now
let me just give you a bit of a
backstory of how i learnt to pipe um
some of you might know that i used to
work in a cupcake bakery
and that's where i learned how to make
cupcakes how to frost cupcakes so
there's two types of people when it
comes to frosting there's the naturals
and there's the people who need practice
i needed practice i learned how to frost
cupcakes it took me about a month of
just practicing every single day now in
the bakery that we worked in we had this
huge huge bench that we all worked on
and at the end of the day my friend or
my boss at the time maggie hey maggie
[Music]
um she
basically said to me dick here's a
frosting start piping start piping on
the bench and i would start from one end
of the bench work my way to the other
side of the bench keep going maggie
would come along with a scraper should
be like not yes no no no yes
and that's how i learnt to frost now i'm
not telling you guys that you need
to get a big bench and start frosting on
your parents bench i'm going to show you
guys how to frost like a pro and all of
the tips and tricks that maggie taught
me when i was learning
so we're going to begin with some of the
tools and equipment we're going to be
using now i get a lot of questions on
how or what
type of food gels i use for my
buttercream frostings or my cakes now i
use two different types of brands i use
american food gel and i also use chef
master it doesn't matter which brand you
use they're basically the exact same
over here i've got some of my american
buttercream frosting recipe you can find
that on my website i've just colored it
different colors so we got blue green
purple and pink
now obviously it's a puff cupcakes we're
gonna need some piping bags i know you
can pipe with ziploc bags it's not as
good you have less control with a ziploc
bag
these are really really cheap these are
disposable piping bags if you like my
mum you wash them and use them again
i don't do that
but these are fairly inexpensive
now this is the most important part of
frosting cupcakes your piping tips now i
was just having a look through my piping
tips drawer and i've probably got about
a hundred of these but you don't need a
hundred piping tips to start off with if
you're just learning to pipe cupcakes i
probably recommend about four to five
different tips and it gives you so much
range and so many
opportunities and styles that you can do
now in this video i'm going to show you
how to pipe how to fill a piping bag how
to fit a piping bag with a fitted tip
let's get stuck into it so you're going
to need some scissors for this now you
want to make sure that you cut just
below the bit where the piping tip kind
of details are
not anything halfway or below that
because then you risk your piping tip
actually popping out of your bag
so the best way to do that is pop your
piping tip inside the bag you're going
to kind of guesstimate where to cut
using that as a guide you want to cut
your bag at the end
you're going to bring your piping tip
through and that's how you fit a piping
bag with a piping tip
the next step is how to fill a piping
bag with frosting now what i like to do
is fold the top of the bag over and kind
of cup it into one of my hands usually
for me i'm right right-handed so it's my
left hand i'm going to use a scoop to
scoop some of my frosting up and we're
going to scoop that into my bag now i'm
just using my thumb to kind of scoop it
off the spoon as i pull the spoon away
once you've filled your piping bag up
with the frosting you want to twist the
end nice and tight now i'm right-handed
so i'm going to use my right hand
to kind of hold the end of my piping bag
the same way that you would hold the
ball and we're going to use the other
hand as a guide if you need to
now a common mistake that people make
when they start frosting for the first
time is to hold their bag on an angle
you actually get a much cleaner swirl
when you're piping your frosting if you
hold your piping bag straight so you
want to make sure that you are holding
it straight i'm just going to quickly go
through my favorite or my top piping
tips and by tips i mean the actual tips
so first one is an open star tip so this
one is a star tip very similar to like a
soft serve
ice cream swirl that you see
that's the effect that you get from this
piping chip
one of the most common ones as well is a
round tip so this one is just a large
round tip now guys uh i don't use any
particular brands i just kind of go off
looks uh you can get these tips in
plastic as well and metal now this one
here is my well one of my favorite
piping tips my actual favorite one is
coming up next but this one here is the
french tip i like to use this when i'm
making italian flavored cakes or
french flavored cakes it's a very
classic
star tip now this one actually has a lot
more teeth than your open star tip so
you get a lot more grooves now the 1m
tip is my favorite piping tip by far i
you can get so many different styles
from this piping tip but it actually
helps me achieve
my signature swirl so i'm going to show
you guys how to do that now
so guys i've got my beautiful vanilla
cupcakes here you can grab the recipe
for that on my website so what we're
going to do is we're going to start in
the middle that's where i like to start
and then we're going to go around so
we're going to kind of let it ruffle a
little bit
as you go up you want to make sure
you're going a little bit inward just to
kind of achieve that nice
cone shape
and that is my signature swirl
now the first one we're going to be
making with the 1m tip is the rose swirl
so this one is actually super super easy
and it looks really pretty as well
so we're going to be starting off in the
center
you want to hold your piping tip about a
centimeter away from the cupcake and you
want to swirl around
from the center when you get to the end
you want to gently tear away from the
frosting
and that is the row swirl
the next piping tip we're going to be
using is the open star tip so this is
similar to the style that you see for
soft serve ice cream and it's a very
common piping tip for swirls on cupcakes
we're going to start in the center and
we're going to swirl around the cupcake
once
then keep swirling on top of that until
you work your way up to the top going
inward as you frost to get that nice
cone shape again
and that is our open star tip
the next piping tip we're going to be
using is our round tip now you can use
this piping tip for lots of different
styles but today we're going to be using
it to make a nice
bulb shape you want to hold your piping
tip about a centimeter away from the
cupcake
squeeze out holding it in place and then
gently lifting up as the frosting starts
to fill out on the cupcake
when you've got your nice bulb shape you
want to give it a very small gentle
swirl at the top and that is our bulb
frosting
the last tip we're going to be using is
our french tip so you can do a number of
styles with this one again
one of the frosting styles you can do
with your french tip or any of the other
tips is my double donut swirl so we're
going to start in the center
we're going to go around the cupcake
once
and then you want to go directly on top
of that when you get to the end you just
want to gently tear away your piping tip
from the frosting and that is the double
donut swirl
the last piping technique is the small
bulb piping technique
so again we're going to be using our
french tip for this one but you can use
any tip for this technique so you want
to hold your piping tip about a
centimeter away from your cupcake
gently squeeze out the frosting just to
make a small bulb shape and then stop
squeezing and pull away from the cupcake
now the cool one about this one is we
can stack these on top of each other and
that is our small bulb technique thank
