hi everybody I'm back and today I'm
going to show you all how to make liver
and
onions over white rice here's what you
will need I have three pieces of liver
you will need flour one small green bell
pepper one small white onion you will
need soy sauce this here is soy sauce
it's just made by
Maggie you will need corn starch garlic
powder onion powder salt pepper olive
oil parsley flakes butter you will need
saone you will need water and right here
this is a beef boy young Cube all right
so now the first thing that we need to
do I've washed my liver well okay first
thing that we want to do is go ahead in
and
season our liver
so I'm going to grab this black pepper
just like so and we're going to season
this up when you all are making liver
you season it up just like you were
making any other meats put a nice amount
of black pepper not too much salt be
very gentle with the salt I'm just going
to put salt on one side okay
salt onion
powder and we'll put some garlic powder
now I'm going to season I know I said I
was going to put salt on one side I'm
going to put all the seasonings on one
side
okay we put the onion powder and now
we're going to do garlic powder just
like
so why am I going to season just one
side I'm seasoning just one side because
the liver is thin okay it doesn't need
to be seasoned on both sides all right
we're going to go in with saon
and I'm going to use a half a packet
we're going to let the saon and the
spices sit in for at least five to seven
minutes before we start to fry this up
okay just like
this
beautiful on my mouth my heart is set on
this liver and onions guys one thing
that I love is liver and onions
smothered liver and onions over White
white rice woo it doesn't get no better
than that guys you hear
me so I've already made my white rice
we're going to let this sit for a few
minutes let the spices soak down in
there meanwhile I've washed my green
bell pepper off I just want to get a few
slices I'm going to take this
out and I'm going to cut some some rings
here
okay get you some bell pepper in there
bell pepper is not traditional for liver
but I happen to love bell pepper and
anytime I get a chance to use it I do I
absolutely adore bell peppers and we're
going to use that in
our
liver and when you cut your onions make
sure that you cut your onions nice and
thick okay you don't want to have your
onions
disintegrate in your dish you want to be
able to taste them and see them that's
why they call it liver and onions cuz
you want to be able to see those onions
all right that's enough bell peppers for
me okay let's go in here and cut I'll
put this aside
we're going to go in and cut our onion
just like so and I like to do the Rings
also as
well and I'll show you just about how
thick have you all Ever Had liver and
onions did you grow up on liver and
onions message me down below and let me
know your
experiences with liver and onions
there's so many people that are crazy
about livering onions and then there's
those people that say oh I don't like it
and they've never tasted it a day in
their life here's what I say to those
people just try it guys don't knock it
until you try it absolutely you have to
try it guys before you say that liver is
so delicious and it has so many Health
properties this is healthy for you okay
so right here we have our nice thick
onion and our bell pepper and I got a
sticker right there and I'm going to
take that sticker right
off okay I found the other
piece all right so
then here's what we're going to
do I'm going to go ahead and put some
olive oil let me show you my pan that
I'll be using
today okay we're going to put some olive
oil in the pan
about that much is all you need you
don't need too too much okay and then I
need to go
in with
butter I like to use either butter by
itself or olive oil and
butter okay and we're going to let this
get nice and bubbly once it starts to
Bubble Up I'll show you what our next
step is
while we're waiting on that to Bubble Up
I'm going to turn this on a medium high
heat okay that's on medium high let's
flour
up our
liver just like
so okay let me get some flour out of my
tub
here and we're going to dread or
liver I grew up eating liver when my dad
would make it for some reason for some
strange reason I would put mustard on it
and I loved it that way I don't do it
that way as an adult but that's how I
ate it as a kid I put mustard on it and
my dad made the best uh liver and my
grandma made it also and it was so good
so when you're dealing with liver liver
you have to be very gentle with it okay
because it'll rip and tear on you so
just take your
time be very gentle and just do one at a
time just one at a time is all you need
all right don't be in a hurry when
you're in that kitchen no worries when
you're making any of my recipes all of
my recipes that I make in this kitchen
is so easy to make so much fun and guys
it tastes so good I mean everything that
I make making this kitchen comes out
perfect okay so let's set this
aside get on over their liver okay we
got these
two just be very gentle with it so it
doesn't rip on you those are nice pieces
too
okay now um what was I going to say when
they make it Jamaican style
they um cut theirs up into like slices
and they use a habanero pepper in there
and I know it's good guys I just can't
take the
heat
so I do mind this way but if you want it
to you can most definitely use a
habanero pepper in your gravy gravy if
you would like to if not you can put red
pepper flakes in your gravy
and that will give you some heat
absolutely you can so this one's almost
coated then we'll let them sit in the
coating for a good 5 to 7 minutes and
then we'll start frying these up watch
how quick this recipe
is oh man look at this my Uncle James
would love this right now I have an
uncle that absolutely loves liver and
onion
oh man okay here we go let's
keep trying your best to make sure you
have this nice en coat it with the flour
like it is okay so over here my pan is
just starting to warm up I'm going to
turn it up just a little until we start
to see this butter right here turn nice
and bubbly once it turns nice and bubbly
that's when we'll add our liver be right
back
everyone okay everyone our butter is
nice and bubbly this is exactly what I
was looking for now you can shake off
your liver pieces and just put them in
just like so ever so
gently
okay turn that up on a medium high we're
going to get these nice and golden
brown just like this
just lay them in there and let them be
you don't have to go in messing with
them with a fork or with the spatula
just let them be and they'll be just
fine
okay once this starts to Brown up you'll
start to see a golden brown ring around
the bottom once you see that golden
brown ring what that will do is indicate
and let you know hey I'm ready to be
turned I'm nice and golden brown on on
this side okay so you'll
know all right I want to wash my hands
anytime you are dealing with any roll
meats you always want to wash your hands
because you don't want to RIS risk
getting anyone sick or spreading
bacteria so you wash your
hands all right so I've just done that
I'm wiping my counter down a little bit
I'm going to turn this heat up a little
bit higher
once I see a nice golden brown color
I'll come back and then we'll flip these
be right back
everyone okay everyone our liver has
cooked for just about 5 minutes let's go
ahead and give it a turn oh
why oh yeah I'm Really Cooking in this
kitchen guys you hear me if you never
saw my channel before or check my
cooking out hey I'm Really Cooking in
here absolutely I am
I appreciate sharing my recipes with you
all okay everybody so I flip the L over
I put the video on pause my husband runs
in here and he's giving me hugs and I
just put the video on pause all right so
here's what we're going to do we have
that side Brown the other side is
getting nice and brown what I like to do
at this point is go ahead and put our
peppers in all right just like this and
I like to do these Circles of the
peppers and onions I would suggest that
it looks more
beautiful the
Rings all
right we're going to do just
this and now the liver's not done yet it
might look like it's done but it's not
done liver will tend to be pink in the
inside if you don't cook it the right
way okay so now this you never want to
cook liver up on too high I'm cooking
this on a medium heat right
now all right and right here I've taken
1 and 1/2 cups of water and three tpoon
of corn starch and I've just mixed it
well this will be my thickening agent
for the gravy all right this what is
this right here is what you call a corn
starch slurry and literally when you put
it in whatever broth that you're making
it will thicken up right before your
eyes it's a very simple technique and so
easy now this here the beef Buon Cube
that I had it was a soft Buon Cube I
just kind of mushed it up cuz this is
going to go in our gravy and it's going
to be so much flavor if you don't have
beef Buon Cube feel free to use chicken
Buon Cube that's just fine absolutely it
is it's okay
okay so what we want to
do at this point we're going to go
ahead and the rest of our saone
packet all right we're going to use
this that's why we saved it we're going
to use it in our gravy let's go ahead
and start
putting well I tell you what let's go go
ahead and push some of your onions and
peppers down so that they can start to
cook a little bit before we put our corn
starch slurry in
okay but I don't like my onions and
peppers cook very very well I like them
to still have some crunch to them all
right so we'll just bring them here so
they can start softening up just a
little and then here in about 5 minutes
we'll pour our corn starch slurry in how
much do I put in Gina just put it in
until you're happy with the desired
amount of gravy that you're going to
have absolutely you don't have to use
all of
that but if you like a whole whole whole
lot of gravy then you can use all of it
okay so my onions and peppers are
starting to get nice and
soft let's go on in with this cornstarch
stir slurry Stir It Up a little bit
Stir It
Up you start pouring it right on the
side just like
so
okay oh absolutely I love that Sizzle
and then we're going to go in with our
soy
sauce now this
slurry will help
aid and cook your onions and peppers and
your Li your liver is just nicely
nestled down into
this okay here's what we're going to do
put you some soy sauce
in all
right just like
this not too much either
guys there's low sodium soy sauces if
you'd
like all right that's going to give you
that gravy color that you're looking for
okay and it's going to give a beautiful
flavor
also okay looks like I would like to
have more gravy so I'm going to make
some more slurry okay and you all will
get to see me make this slurry so I'm
just putting some water
in okay let me get a
teaspoon okay meanwhile I'm going to
turn this down while I make another corn
starch slurry which is very simple here
check me out guys I have
water just going to put some corn starch
in just like
so just mix that bad boy
up this is the thickener the magic
thickener all right make sure it's well
Incorporated and you pour it right in
okay just like that now now our sazone
you put that sazone in there oh yes
absolutely when I tell you all we are
flavoring this
food we layer the flavors in this
kitchen we're going to go
in with that beef boy on and we're just
going to disperse it evenly throughout
the
gravy all right
now this will
simmer oh my
word I got my rice done
already guys tonight we are having
smothered liver and onions over white
rice I'm going to make some mes water
tonight you hear me all you liver lovers
out there I know you're out
there now so let me tell you all okay so
I'm going to taste this gravy really
quick
and it'll thicken up here in a second
and I'll show you all so when I met my
husband do you all want to taste this
you can taste it if you want taste right
there
okay oh beautiful yes man Does that
taste good
I I'm so excited I'm going to go in with
just a little bit little bit more soy
sauce just a tad bit okay so when I met
my husband
and I was doing all that cooking that I
was doing and showing him everything
that I knew how to make we came across
liver and he said oh no uhuh he said I I
don't do liver I don't like it and I'm
thinking like do you not like it or are
you just saying you don't like it and
you've never tried it he's like oh no
uhuh uhuh I I don't I don't eat it and
so one day
I never tried to push him to eat it one
day I was cooking liver you know it
wasn't for him it was for me and he says
oh my gosh girl like what are you
cooking and I said um I'm making Li and
onions he was like that smells so good
it's like the best smell besides fried
chicken and I'm like I
know right and surely he came up to me
and he was like let let me taste a
little bit of that
right and he tasted it and he's like oh
my goodness he's like this is so good
he's like this reminds me of smothered
steak and he liked it and he ate it and
so now throughout the years we've been
together we've been together a long time
and so now throughout the years when I
make it he's like let me get some of
that so he likes it now
so what that tells you is don't knock it
until you try it the right way guys
there's so many people that makes things
the wrong
way you know and you have that I'm
putting pepper I'm going to put a little
bit of garlic
powder so many people that makes things
when we're
younger and it's not the right way and
you just have that memory stuck in your
head and you think uhuh I didn't like it
when I was younger you know and our
palette changes as we get older
also um so I think he had that stuck in
his head but since he had it the right
way guys he is like give me some of that
liver
girl and I'm so happy to make it for him
