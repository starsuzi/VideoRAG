hi today I'm going to show you how to
make a real Swiss g a cheese fondue so
these packages here you can buy at
Costco they're around $10 and it's uh
450 G what you need is 200 g per
person so we're four of us tonight so
we're going to measure 800 G of g a
so what you want to do is grade the
cheese because you don't want to put it
in big chunks into the hot wine cuz it
will take longer to
melt so now we need to take out our
so-called
cocko for now we'll take one big garlic
loaf peel
it cut it in half
and then we'll rub the garlic in the
pan next
we'll peel some more garlic and cut it
in small little pieces all depending how
much garlic you like like we like a lot
of garlic in there so I'll probably use
about eight
cloves which is actually quite a lot so
like I mentioned we'll cut them in small
little pieces
and different sizes
too sorry for my colored fingers but we
were just painting Easter eggs out an
hour
ago okay so now we'll put
our garlic into the so-called goo which
is cut in different sizes and you can
see there's actually quite a lot of
garlic so you definitely don't want to
go for an interview the next day so next
we'll get the white wine ready you
definitely want use a dry white wine and
per person it's one deciliter like 100 m
Mill so we are four people which means
we're going to go with 400
m okay then we pour the wine into the
gcko and just Stir It Up a tiny bit
there we
go we'll use paprika
so we put some Paprika in
there then we definitely have to put
some
nutmeg gives them a real good
taste some ground pepper and there again
all to taste now I actually like to put
some herbs in there too so I'll just put
a tiny bit of Basil in
there this can definitely be made
without the herb herbs I'll put some
oregano and some Italian
spice so next we'll get the binding
stuff with the cheese and the white wine
so here I have corn starch and for each
person we'll take one
teaspoon put it in this
glass then this is very important like
the real K so this really gives them the
flavor it's quite expensive and you
really have to look for it here so if
you know anybody going to Switzerland
make sure they bring some home because
it's way cheaper over there since it's
such a good taste I'll go
with about
three and this you will also uh use when
you eat the Fone
D steer it up nicely so it's all
dissolved
so now you want to cut the bread into
cubes and this bread I made myself I
usually make my own bread and it's Rye
which you can also buy at any
Bakery then we'll get the burner
ready and this is fondue fuel
and it's also
adjustable cuz here and there you will
have to adjust
it so now that we have the white wine
really nice
and hot we start putting in our
cheese and we sort of steer in a figure
eight
just to get
nicely
dissolved so now that the cheese is
nicely melted it with the wine you put
in our corn starch with the K and you
really want to whisk it in
there this will bind the cheese and the
white
wine turn the heat up again
so now we can see that the cheese and
the wine has nicely binded together turn
the heat down a bit and important for
the cook to take a piece of
bread and to try it to see if there's
enough spices in there which can always
be
added and make sure you don't burn
yourself because is pretty
hot M very
good okay so now we're ready we'll put
this on the burner
let it cook
here ready to
eat okay so what we like to do is just
tip your bread a little bit into the
kersch you don't have
to start
steering start turning so the cheese
doesn't fall down and make sure you
don't burn your mouth and there we go
it's also tradition to have some white
wine and
tea cheers s
