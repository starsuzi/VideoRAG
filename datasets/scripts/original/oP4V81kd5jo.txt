hi today we are going to make duron a
filipino snack
for ingredients we need spring roll
wrappers banana
jackfruit and brown sugar
the first thing we'll do is lay the
wrapper flat on a surface
then we're adding the banana and then
sprinkle
a little bit of brown sugar
add a little more and then now we're
going to use jackfruit
you can use fresh ones or the canned
ones
and now we are going to start wrapping
arturon
and get it ready for frying
make sure you seal the corners tighter
and you can also sprinkle a little sugar
at the edges
and now we're getting ready to fry it
in a pot of hot oil now the oil needs to
be slightly hot like i'd say put in
medium heat
and i'm sorry that the video is a little
bit blurred
here
now we're going to fry this until it's
golden brown and in between
you can add a little bit more brown
sugar
to help add to the sweetness of this
snack
now turon i think is by far one of my
most favorite
snack while i was still in the
philippines
there used to be a vendor that sells
these to run
outside our school and
i think i might have had maybe
two or three times in a week
okay now um the turin is
almost done as you can see it's turning
golden brown so
remember to keep your heat in medium low
and here's the final product enjoy
you
