oregano plant at growplans.org
this is one of my oregano plants in my
garden
I grow few varieties and this one I
start from cutting
I have another one that they start from
seeds I mostly I recommend to start or
from
cutting or plant seeds are if you want
to give it a try for something else in
few minutes I will show it this is a
size of a long live here A big one
you're bigger and the reason that I show
you this is a have strong flavor and
kind of big leaves but I have another
one
just a second we'll move here to another
location that I grow
that
here
this is a huge I put my finger next to
the other one
on purpose to show that this is much
bigger this is a start from seeds
and it's very good one this is used more
for salads and stuff like this fresh and
this is have a weak fragrance and
flavor so you can use it to Raw mustard
roll and
it's nicer for salads if you're another
type yes so as you can see from the same
I put some seeds here and this is small
leaves
so
it's really nice this is stronger
as the other one but with smaller leaves
the most important things to know if you
want to start from seeds or not it's if
you want to take a risk it's a risk but
here I got a very good risk from this I
will continue to graft
you just take it you put it in water
this is one option or you bend it over
and cover it with sand and then you have
a new Roots the best season for this
it's a spring Winters and Autumn yeah
most of their summer it's also possible
to do but it will take more time after
three weeks something like this you
already have a new plant
even it's a new
as you can see here
from the new one so it succeeded
okay so planting season I think they're
the best it's if you are in a frost area
it's in the
uh spring and if not Autumn or spring
it's okay I prefer Autumn it's a
established Barrel I think my opinion
so we talked before the way to start it
by seeds or by
[Applause]
cuttings or just plant and to maintain
the plants grow over and over you just
cover it a little bit and you have here
if you can see
start new roots
I'm not sure how much you can see this
is here you see the new Roots I just
clean it down and the roads start to
grow it's a
crazy how much it easy
[Music]
can't survive from full sun to half
shade or even full shade with light
um
you can grow it indoor but with a lot of
light but it's possible it won't be a
problem and this is great you can use it
for salad cooked spices herbs varieties
and again if you want to take a chance
to get something new and very good this
is very good for you know I can use this
for a new variety so you take the risk
with the seeds
if not just cutting then start with
substance that you know so that's all
