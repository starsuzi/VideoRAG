for the body i'm going to cut one of
these nine inch cakes in half
put this aside
and i'm going to cut out the tail
so i'm just going to cut in an angle
just like this
[Music]
put this aside so that's going to be the
tail of the dinosaur
now i'm going to cut out the head so i'm
just going to
run it out just like this
like a half circle
there we go
and then cut this side
so it's not pointy
this is
the side that you'll be attaching to the
body of the cake i'm going to go ahead
and
cut this more so it's more of a roundish
shape round it out a bit
now we're going to cut out the legs so
i'm going to cut the other half of the
cake in half
and then again into
fourths
from each piece of the triangle you're
going to cut from the top
and just down
you're pretty much cutting out this
triangle here
but you're going to be using this piece
for the leg it's going to
sit up like that after you cut out that
piece for the leg cut off the top part
about an inch off
so that piece should look like this
time to put together our dinosaur so we
are making a stegosaurus
so here is the body so i'm just going to
just position it and then we'll put the
frosting on
there's the head
[Music]
for the plates and the spikes i'm just
using some stretchy candy that i warmed
up in the microwave for about 10 seconds
to soften it up or you can use fondant
i'm just gonna roll it up with a rolling
pin
and what you need to do is just cut out
a pentagon shaped plate just like so and
i'll show you how to do that
so you can start with a square
and all you have to do is just cut off
the bottom
so you should have a pentagon shape
plate just like that
and if you want you can
make the bottom
more narrow
just like that so it should look like
that
and you'll be making a few they'll range
from the biggest to the smallest
make sure to save the leftover candy
for the spikes on the tail
we decided to make a baby one and my
daughter actually decorated this little
one here
