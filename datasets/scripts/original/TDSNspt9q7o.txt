all right what I got here is this Valley
Coin table you see in
bars some in clubs but anyways this the
first time ref felt my table buers were
shot so said just start to do it
all all right this right here I got it
off easy bilders it's just some wool
cloth it's U 85% wool
and 15% or 10% n something like that but
anyway it's World blue light
so all right see I already took it all
apart as you can see it's pretty simple
just a couple bolts on each side take
off the Silver Parts on it take the
bolts out and then your bumpers just
fall right off and uh Subs aside anyway
pick the table up you can do it I had a
bud come over here help grab Each corner
just pick it up turn it sideways and set
up light right here and these dark spots
like this right here and all this stuff
right here what it is is beeswax took a
butane
torch and just held the held the wax
over it and just kind of aimed it where
I was going to put it at and just
dripped it all over over
and uh let it dry and get you like a 6
in putty knife and then scrape it and
you want it to be smooth you don't want
to feel no no like chips in it at all so
took me a few minutes to do it but hey
got done but um I was about ready to lay
this Bel down and some videos don't
really describe a lot of things so I
figured I'd do it and try to help
somebody out don't know if I would cuz I
kind of mess up on the SP a little bit
but it'll work
but see I already pre-cut my felt I got
a 9t section and uh that way I have
enough do my bumpers but uh I just fold
it all
up so back to the
center you want to start in the center
point of your
table whenever you going to get ready to
do this
Bel I me going to be dead center but you
know I cut my
uh I cut my corners
um at 6 in from the from the top of this
right here I went down 6 in and kind of
like at a triangle V so I have enough to
wrap under it and then everywhere else
like on the sides on this side you know
I at 4 in so just enough to go down and
up you have about three and know three
and a qu something like that inches up
underneath it but uh that's what this is
right here so see kind of messed up but
uh I was getting ready to spray the
adhesive on it I'm using this 3 mil 3
mil super 77 multipur adhesive some
pretty good stuff as they say and um you
spray it on the top you know just like
your rails how they hang over you want
to do about that about that wide all the
way around the table you also want to do
all the way up underneath it about as
much as the same about like have 4 in
under there you want to spray at least
four to five so you have enough room to
play with and you want to start at one
side of your table this the top part or
down that side so you can get a good
stretch on it all the way across it so
you want it to be you know tight so
that's what I'm about to try to do so
I'm just going to flip these up so I'm
getting on the
F just like that right
there just make sure it's in the center
somewhat so we got to fold it over it
ain't all over the place
so let's see how good it does I mess up
oh
well have to fix it it's life learn day
by day when you spray it you can get a
little bit on the edges around to here
on the the side of the table that's good
to help hold it but do what you can
Ain't Nobody's Perfect
that's that that
that
good good
solid get all stick
acoss just kind of rise up a little
tight
getting a good
pull
for
for
for
for for
you going to pull tie as you can get it
I just kind of f see how it's
loose pull it more pull it some more get
it tight
what I do
[Music]
with for
[Music]
the right St to do it wouldn't be as
hard s you got to run your hand across
the distance like
that and not bulge up on
you got a little spot right there
but should be all
right I ain't perfect like I said the
first time so just kind of looks a
little bit you don't want
that still kind of still kind of wait a
little bit
so try to get it out real quick
any size as I want any size as I wanted
to be but
it's going to have good
rolling good
speed pretty good felt you know for what
I PID for this felt was uh it was like
6867 off isy
building and they have a thing it's 20%
off you know if you purchase more than
just one thing like a couple of
different things that I wanted it but uh
the bumpers over there they're over
there drying if you can see them in the
video but all it is I just used some of
that you get it everything you get Lo
but up at your table this Wellwood
contact cement some black and red can
just get your old toap old
brush put a good coat on it kind of sand
it down a little bit make sure you get
most of the he of off that's already on
there or cement but
uh other than that it's just kind of
plain it simply you know anything
about just uh any kind of restoration
you know You' be familiar with with some
of this stuff but um before you do
anything before you do the felt the wax
all that you know you want to scrape the
edges where you going to spray that
adhesive that was already down you kind
want to hit that with a scraper real
quick trying to get it off and I clean
my table with
Windex and it cleaned the table came up
clean pretty
good and just like to scrape it maybe a
little three 180 sandpaper real light
scuff up so it hold a little bit better
but just try to get all your like your
little nicknack stuff in the table up
because who wants to play on a table
that's that's
uh that's kind of messed
up still a
little still a little
loose just got to get it right
can I'll fix it all I can do
it's a little better like that a little
bit better it'll work
see it's right there
that's but it's tight
enough make me happy girlfriend stopped
bitching at me about doing
it just like everything El I do this I
do that
