try or or give me a call or a comment
down below and I can mail them to you
whatever
oh was one
minute it's getting
there there it
is all
right it's sticky like prolin
now the instructions is even seeing you
can do the whole thing at one time or
you can do two
scoops let the jar and the contents cool
to room temperature put the cap back on
and put it in the
refrigerator and then you know you can
use it the next time you want to um
pretty cool so we'll check it out and
see yep yep I bought this from Keith's
Hardware down the B on the four lane new
four lane uh pretty cool store they have
everything in that store I'm talking
about everything from beer to crawfish
traps to Crazy Prine concoctions I mean
they have everything over there if you
ever in the area check them out ke
hardware and if you and if you and if
you're from down to Baya tell ke give
them some props you know what I mean all
right here we go
minute
Mark oh yeah

punk oh yeah it's almost I can see it
what this is gon to be crazy if this
works
man I don't taste bad at
all come on are you
serious all right it's
beeping holy
shoot uh they didn't tell you in
instruction to take some out this has
boiled everywhere
man what the hell look what happened
fellas look what happened it boiled out
everywhere but you know what we're going
to eat that all right so I'm stirring it
and uh we're going to put a few right
here
just like that and don't worry about it
I'mma eat it off of this
jar so I'm guessing if this comes out
good and I recommend
it to uh when you first get the
jar pull some out but that ain't no big
deal see that right there that's going
to dry we're going to eat
that look tast is really good so uh
let's let let's let this stuff cool off
and then I'll get back to you once it's
cool okay peace all right YouTube it's
been a couple minutes um there's two
type of parlins you can make uh chewy or
not chewy and I believe these are going
to be a little bit of chewy cuz it's you
have to kind of like scrape it off
but taste
Wise It's very good and yes this this
this is going to be a sort of
a chewy
Prine

want to know some more information about
this parine in a jar and
overall tastes real good and I'm hoping
