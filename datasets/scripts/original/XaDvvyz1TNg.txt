hi it's Angel and today I really really
need a caffeinated pickme up drink but
instead of going to my closest Starbucks
I'm going to make green tea Macha latte
at home this recipe actually came from
one of my travels in Japan where I
visited this really cute green tea latte
shop called CS green tea and they served
everything from matcha green tea lattes
to mocha green tea lattes and one of
their drinks had toasted soybean powder
in it and it kind of had a Nutty flavor
maybe a little bit of mty taste it's
really hard to explain so you're going
to have to watch the video Try it at
home and let me know how you like it so
let's get
started now before we start let's go
over the dry ingredients we'll need for
the day first we'll need 1 teaspoon of
matcha green tea powder now when you go
to the grocery store and look for this
you'll see that they're selling
different grades of green tea powder
there is the ceremonial the premium and
the ingredients level grade which is
more for baking I would say just go for
the premium we'll also need 1 to 1 and
1/2 tbspoon of organic cane sugar and
half a teaspoon of The Toasted soybean
powder now you should be able to find
find The Toasted soybean powder and the
matcha powder at your local Asian
grocery store if you don't have some on
hand
already now my favorite part we're going
to mix things up with a mediumsized bowl
take your matcha powder add that to the
bowl and add a bit of hot water about
the amount of a shot glass or two should
do next use a whisk to mix the matcha I
just happen to have a traditional
Japanese bamboo matcha whisk handy but
any regular whisk will do you just want
to make sure that the matcha is
completely dissolved because honestly
matcha chunks don't taste
good once you're done you want to
transfer the matcha drink into your
serving cup now since this recipe makes
about a 12 oz cup I'm going to go ahead
and use a 12 oz cup here add your cane
sugar
and your roasted soybean powder directly
over the
matcha and give that a quick
stir when you're done set it
aside next we'll want to get hot milk
I've got about a cup and a/4 of hot milk
which I've gone ahead to heat up in the
microwave you can also do this over the
stove but if you have a microwave it's
easier next in a mediumsized bowl pour
the hot hot milk directly into the bowl
and with a balloon whisk whisk
vigorously for 20 to 30
seconds yes your arm will be tired and
it might be sore but it's a good workout
just think of it as a Prem matcha latte
workout when you're done you should be
able to see a nice thick foam so that
when you run a spoon over it the foam is
really hard to get off the
[Music]
spoon now I'm just going to transfer the
hot milk over to a container that's
easier to pour with I'm going to then
pour the milk over the
matcha and with the remaining foam
that's left gently scoop it over the
matcha and I like to fill up up all the
way up to the
top touchup if needed
then as kind of a last finishing step
I'm going to take a small powdered sugar
spoon and with the matcha I'm going to
lightly dust the foam with the matcha
powder now you can do this with the
soybean powder as well but I like the
matcha powder because it's green and it
really pops with the color over the
white foam it's really very
pretty and as a final optional step
I like to serve my matcha with a piece
of
chocolate mint chocolate to be
exact so how does it taste let's try it
first a bited
chocolate then M that smells so good I
can smell the roasted soybean
powder the Macha latte is so yummy
[Music]
so that's how you make green tea Macha
latte with roasted soybean powder at
home it's a special drink that's super
tasty so I hope you guys actually try
this one and let me know how you like it
I like to serve it with either some
chocolate or I've got some red bean
Jello-O here which is also very tasty
and I might just show you guys how to
make this in one of my next videos so
keep watching and please subscribe bye
now
