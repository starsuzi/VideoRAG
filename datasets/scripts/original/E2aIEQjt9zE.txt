so I've got this lovely little wild area
in the the garden here and just here
probably somewhere around here I'm going
to create a bug Hotel so I've collected
all my materials you can see them all
dotted around here but the first thing I
need to do is to clear the area and
level the ground so we'll do that first
right so now we've got the the area
cleared a little bit the most important
thing that we need to do now is to make
sure that the first bricks that go down
are lovely and level so we'll do that
next
and it's
worth taking a bit of time with this
first
one just to make sure that we get
everything nice and
level cuz it will make the rest of the
construction a lot easier
so it's looking pretty good there
[Music]
[Music]
let's try
that not
bad a little bit off level so we need to
move that around a little bit do
with bit of soil back
there that should
help levels back up
let try
that a bit more in the back
there
right so now we've done that we can
start by filling underneath so I think
what I'm going to put under there is
let's go
for let's go for a mixture of pine
con chunky
ones at the front that
look quite
nice we go don't worry if there's any
gaps at this stage cuz you can fill them
in
[Applause]
later back there I'm going to fill the
rest of the
gaps some
hay quite nicely pack it all in
looks
good and now that we've done that the
the first layer
on we're ready to build the rest of the
layers right then let's get building
[Music]
so here's the the finished bug Hotel you
see all the different layers so we start
off with the first layer which is just
pine cones and Meadow hay then on the
next layer we've got broken tiles roof
tiles then we've got some cut tweaks and
logs and the next layer is some slate
that I had laying around the garden and
then the top layer here is some more
Logs with some bamboo in there as well
and then right on the top we've got a
planter made out of some old decking we
filled it with some soil and all we've
got left to do now is to sew some
wildflower seeds in there and then we're
ready to rock and
roll so now that the construction of the
bug house is finished all we've got to
do now is sew the wildflower seeds on
the top here now I've got a couple of
different types I've got these ones here
these are from grow wild but I've also
got some seed balls now seed
balls are let me open the tin and show
you I don't know if you can see them
there
the little bows of
clay
mixed with wild flour seeds and a little
bit of chili just to give them a kick to
hopefully deter some of the birds and
other animals that might eat the seeds
but the idea is with these you just grab
them and scatter them
around on the
so randomly over the
so just like this
this and then leave them and the idea is
that when it rains or if you water them
the clay will gradually break down and
then the seeds will germinate and then
the flowers will
grow
alternatively you could use to grow wild
seeds now they come in a little sachche
and if I open this up you'll be able to
see so look here you can see see they're
all different shapes and
sizes you don't need many of these
particularly in the the area that we've
got there that's probably enough what
we'll
do is
just sprinkle
those over the
area and then we'll
just rub the so over
them like that and we'll give it a water
and then as soon as that's done we just
leave it and then hopefully in a few
weeks we'll start to see the shoots come
up and then eventually we'll have lots
of wild flowers on
there well that's another bug Hotel
finished in the garden hopefully that's
inspired you and giving you a few ideas
of how you can create one in your own
garden all that's left to do now is to
tidy up this lot
