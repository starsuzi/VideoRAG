now um today I did a video
on uh of all things a
tree but I did it with a Twist and made
it out of Mountain Dew
glass uh I noticed that you guys really
enjoyed the the uh Mountain Dew and the
little green dolphin that I did so I'm
continuing that line of of work and
seeing if you like it more um click like
click subscribe have a good day and
enjoy the
show okay I'm
back I don't know if you can read that
or not but that's an
old Mountain Dew
bottle even says return for
deposit cool
anyway I remember going through my
grandfather's shed and getting all those
soda bottles out of his shed and taking
them down and getting some money for
them
okay uh wire
cutters it can be
nipped as you can see right now it's not
important where it gets nipped and how
big the well the chunks going to have to
get to the point where I can work with
it there we
go
now I know I have some
Green Mountain Dew
glass
somewhere ready to
go magic of modern
television okay as you can see I've got
some Mountain Dew bottle glass
already stretched out into a rod here
and I'm taking one of the
chunks and heating and putting a nice
trying to put a weld but you got to do
this really really careful and only on
the one corner Edge whatever touch it
too
now this is the important
part warm it
in slowly
you can see I'm waving it like you
know it's very very important if you do
not warm it in
correctly and yes you can put it on a
heat plate and warm it up on a heat
plate and do it that way and use pliers
to do whatever you want to do
with
okay when you think you've done it long
enough wave it in for a little longer
I think I'm close and you can start to
tell by when you wave it in and you can
sort of see the edges start to turn
orange
okay
now going to try to pull some of this
um decal off
it's in the zone but you got to make
sure you keep it warm the whole
thing okay
I'm just basically trying to peel off
the where the decal
was so I can use all of the
glass I know I could have used the rest
of the the bottle but I think I did that
or it's in another location somewhere
this was all I had
available so I'm taking it and doing it
the hard
[Laughter]
way that's the way life is sometimes
right oh
yeah you're pinching and pulling that
stuff
off okay I think I've got most of
it what I'm going to do with
this is pretty
interesting one of the
suggestions and I noticed that most of
the Hits come from the Mountain Dew
bottle well the recent hit H anyway the
the biggest quickest hits
surprisingly showing people I can do
with the do that other people don't
right
okay I also find that when you stretch
this you got to do it just
right let it
flow it'll round into itself basically
as you can see I'm practically burning
my fingers off no I'm not my fingers are
warm but they're not
hot if your fingers are warmer than that
or hotter than
that and you want to play with the soft
glass like this get a hold of some more
soft glass rods it'll be better punes
and I've got at the
moment
anyway here we go stretching it out
slowly it's sort of shrinking into
itself and then after it shrinks into
itself I stretch it out into
and this is going to come into real
Handy real real
quick
okay keep turning it gravity works with
this stuff
now right angle
Bend twist it a little bit pull it
up pull it out seen me do those a couple
of times that's like horse legs and so
on and so forth here's where it gets fun
heat up near one of the bins seal it
together well and I mean that it's
looking like one piece of glass heat up
pull out bend it in another
Direction now again you got to keep this
stuff warm this is soft glass it's not
pirate so you got to keep it even warmer
and keep waving it in all the
time heat
up bend it in another Direction Turn it
another way
boom
okay heat up seal it
together stretch it
bend it twist
it
boom again you got to keep it warm warm
warm warm warm warm warm and by the way
keep it warm otherwise you're going it's
going to break on
you now I don't know if you got it the
idea here I know I'm not doing reindeer
antlers looks like it could be yeah
a little bit more sporadic than
that
and I'm also going to do a clear glass
tree out of
borro yes I gave it away a
tree you just sort
of in the Bora I'm going to do a lacy
top thing to it it's going to look
really cool so like a bonsai tree but
with this soft
glass it's going to be S like
a tree in Winter all you got to see all
you see is the
branches
okay oh heard a crack yep yep yep yep
yep that's where I put one of them
together again I even was not paying
much
attention okay
I think we're done with how many legs I
mean how many branches was just to give
you an idea of a tree I'm going to do a
cold
Weld and do the base oops
Yeah I'm going to do the base with the
uh I'm going to do another cold weld cuz
that was the pun that I started
with I'm going to use the same glass for
the same
glass all the way around
even for the ruts or Roots
whatever now the root I usually do like
two or three main
ones because you need something for it
to stand on and triod
works and they don't have to be perfect
and you could you know do it just one
Branch off one of those like
so tripod works
though even curl one
around
okay and it off in another
Direction sort of do the same thing as
you do for the top of the tree but you
do it for the roads
okay fire polish that
off I'll show you this
later and you've
got one green
tree hope you enjoyed it
enjoy your
day here we
are the Mountain Dew tree I know it's
not the best looking thing but it was
just a quick demo so you can get an
idea enjoy your day
