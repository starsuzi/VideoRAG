We all know that honey has a lot of health
benefits, which is mainly due to the large
number of vitamins and minerals that it contains.
However, this is only true in pure honey and
a lot of what you find at the supermarket
is not pure honey.
A lot of times, honey is mixed with glucose
solutions or other honey with a high amount
of water.
This process is called being adulterated and
it takes away from the health benefits that
you receive from home.
So, how can you tell if your honey is pure?
Today we will discuss just that.
1.
Solidification of the Honey
Take a look at the bottle and see what the
honey inside of it looks like.
Overtime, all honey will crystallize into
something looking like granulated sugar.
If it is crystallized in the store, this is
pure honey.
If it is liquid, you could wait to see if
it solidifies.
Putting it in the refrigerator will speed
up that process.
If your honey never turns into crystals, then
it is likely that you do not have pure honey
on your hands.
2.
Read the Label
Before you purchase any products, you should
always learn to read labels.
Make sure that the ingredient list of the
honey does not contain high-fructose corn
syrup or glucose.
These are two substances that are usually
added to honey that keep it from solidifying.
Companies also add this to the honey so that
they get more honey out of their batch.
3.
Test It
There are other ways to test to see if your
honey is pure:
Mix some honey with water, then add four or
five drops of vinegar.
If the liquid turns foamy, that is not pure
honey.
It may have a substance called gypsum added
to it.
Mix a tablespoon of honey with water.
If the honey dissolves easily, it is not pure,
as pure honey should remain intact when dipped
into water.
Use a match to try and burn the honey, as
pure honey will light up and burn due to the
sugar content.
Other low-quality honey usually contains water
that will prevent it from lighting and burning.
Put some honey onto a spoon and hold it up.
If the honey falls quickly, then this is not
pure honey.
Good quality, pure honey, will stay on the
spoon or fall ever so slowly.
Use a small piece of old, stale bread and
put it in honey.
Leave it in for ten minutes and then pull
it out of the honey.
If the bread is still hard, then you have
pure honey.
If the honey has added water, the bread will
be soggy.
You can also use iodine to identify impure
honey.
Just mix honey, water and a few drops of iodine.
If the mixture turns blue, then the honey
has some sort of added flour or starch in
it.
Testing your honey will ensure that you have
pure, unadulterated honey that will provide
you with the health benefits of honey that
you know of and care about.
Do you buy honey often?
Did you know that honey can be tampered with
by manufacturerâ€™s to better meet their bottom
line, rather than your health?
