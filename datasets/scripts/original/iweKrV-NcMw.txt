one owner car guy one on a carguy.com
and I'm going to show you a little bit
on Wheels and we use a wheel acid on
these and I'm just trying to spray this
down and you want to get a little water
on it and screw it all down first
get it soaking in and I'll show you up
close here before we do anything
um actually
I'll take a picture of a different one
for before also
but as you can see here
all that stuff and just makes these
wheels look a certain way
and wheel acid you shouldn't use on an
alloy wheel unless you really know what
you're doing
and
we really know what we're doing
well I just thought I'd say that
you want to get not to be on for a long
time with this
and also a little bit of scrubbing and
obviously you want to be very careful
stay back a bit not spray it in your
eyes not get it on your hands
and wash your hands immediately if you
do and that is the wheel acid now it'll
do its job for
depends on how how um
good he's got it mixed
um
I'm reaching for my brush there
you see the stuff just melting off
nothing can stand up to the wheel acid
well some stuff can't
and now if you want these to be clean
you got them little holes there and
you're gonna have to brush them out with
a different kind of brush and he's got a
brush for that too we got a brush for
every job I tell you
just get in there and
really scrub a dub dub you don't got to
be in a tub
but you do gotta scrub a dub dub
and also here we're working with soap
you're working with wheel acid
and you don't want to be blocking this
stuff in your eyes for sure it's just
not a good thing
Martha Stewart would not say it's a good
thing so you say it's a bad thing or
something like that
well that's the deal
and you know I might as well just
kind of show you what we've been talking
about here you can check out my videos
and we'll pop a link up right there or
something for the clay bar and we did
this one on how to tell when the clay
bar is not any good anymore and if you
don't know what a clay bar does it
cleans a lot of the contaminants off and
you can see
that's him scrubbing that's me smell
that now
oh man all the difference in the world
so
probably now I'm gonna have to start
this power washer up for Trent in a
second and he sprayed a little bit more
wheel acid on it
and I'm gonna
do another light scrub on it and that's
another thing you want to keep stuff
wetted up by what it up I mean keep it
wetted up you don't want it to ever
completely dry out
so we're gonna start this up now and
he's gonna wait until he blows it off
until I'm over there where we can show
that happening
um

now we're talking all the difference in
the world
seriously and when I say all the
difference in the world I ain't just
telling you that to where you can say
you're right no look at this
hang on before I even go there no I will
show it after look at this
this is the way to go it's a very
professional you can see there's a
couple things there if you're going
really picky you can sit there and get
that little piece off but
look at them Wheels oh buddy that is
nice let's show you how they looked
before
why not
Blair buddy
seriously the fact that you can make
that go to the other
and I'm gonna go back to the other side
just to show you one ownercarguy.com and
if you want to see more videos like this
hopefully we'll pop about five or six up
in there oh to where you can see just a
couple things and a couple professional
things that you can do and if you've got
a car like this let's say you've got an
87 300E and you've got these wheels and
they look like that my God you do that
to them you add so much money to your
car I mean it's it's your time is
exponentially times times itself over
time it's double pennies times dollars
and you get the point one
