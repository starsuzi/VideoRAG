okay what's going on everybody and my
wife who purchased our first glass top
stove about seven months ago we've been
having problems trying to find an
adequate cleaner to clean the glass top
so I was always worried about these
lines if we were going to scrape off the
lines by rubbing too hard um so after a
couple different tries of stuff this is
the cooktop cleaner that we came up with
it's called Wayman
cook top Max micro bead scrubbing power
it comes with this cool little
applicator right
here it's got
the like this doesn't feel like like
metal at all it feels like something
different it's a little bit lighter than
that then you got your scouring
pad and uh right here if you just pull a
little cap off it looks like this and
this smells like smells like crap smells
like a
H smells like bad fish is what it smells
like but don't worry about the smell
because it's going to do the job so what
I'd like to do first is is really see
how dirty it is and that's there just
rub a cloth over it and you can see that
that's actually not that bad right here
some days it's better or worse and then
just take
this like this
like that and just rub it in a
circle and you're not going to rub the
the lines off it and and you'll know
that you're doing all right job because
it will feel
smooth under here so any any part that
feels a little
rough just keep doing it until it
becomes nice and
smooth you know I don't use any water on
this I just
uh do it like like this and sometimes
you know I go in a back and forth
pattern
especially if uh I want to make sure
that that I get everything like there's
a little piece right
here sometimes you got to keep scrubbing
to get it off there I said I haven't had
to scratch it yet I have a couple
scratches but it's not from this we had
that a while ago before I even bought
this so here we go all
right so if you can't get the little
area
off use the other side right
there
there came off just fine
now you all the liquid stuff that we've
been using just doesn't
work okay
now then I just go and I I'll take a
paper
towel take a quick paper towel and I'll
wet the paper towel just a little
bit and then I'll wipe it
off and it's going to come out straight
don't worry about
that you can take glass
cleaner something like
that there we go see look at that looks
like brand
new all right so we we tried a few
cleaners and this is just by far the
best one and the applicator that comes
with it it's pretty good
too there and you can see where it's
starting to Haze up a little
bit don't wor about that you know clean
off your stainless steel
too you know we have her glass right
here just clean it all
off and try to keep your stove clean
especially if you have a nice stove you
want to keep it
clean you want your neighbors to come on
over and see that you don't live like a
slob here but we all know how it gets
when you when you're cooking and it's
just uh you know you and your standard
family you know you can get a little
lazy
sometimes but if you got to clean it
make it a habit of doing a good job okay
so we have our little Haze right here as
you can see what I'll do is I'll either
just take a dry paper towel and I'll
just go go over
it and that will get rid of the haze
here but like I said you can use glass
cleaner which we have that too I just
you know use a good glass cleaner cuz
glass cleaner will streak too you know
Windex you can't go wrong with your
standard Windex
original there we
go
bam like brand
new so let me show you what this brand
is
again and I like said I bought this at
loads and you can you could rinse this
off
that's not a problem so just go ahead
and rinse it off in your sink get it
nice and clean before you put it back in
the
package there we
go rinse it out really
nice put it back in there close the
top and there you have it it's really
really super super simple you don't have
to make it you don't have to over
complicate it if you just go to Lowe's
and buy this they might have an extra
local grocery store
too Wayman cooktop Max with the
scrubbing
pad all right can't beat it I mean
undoubtedly it is the best stuff I've
used so there we go guys you know if you
like my videos go ahead and subscribe
I'm trying to do you know some
rebottling to my house and stuff like
that so just stay tuned for a couple
videos cuz I'm doing everything myself
all the stuff I'm doing I'm doing for
the first time and first time only you
know I'm just looking at a couple
YouTube videos getting a couple uh tips
from my friends who are contractors and
stuff like that and attempting
everything myself why not because I'm
cheap it's because I feel that I can do
the work myself but I have to pay a
contractor big money for really nothing
we can use that for a vacation we can
use that for different upgrades on the
house so there you go guys thanks for
watching
