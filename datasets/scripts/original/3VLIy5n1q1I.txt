Hi, I’m Mat from eSpares and this is a product
that gets consistently great reviews on the
eSpares website. It’s the Karcher Drain
Cleaning Kit and the reason it gets such great
reviews is because it’s genius. Underneath
the bras s nipple, here, are rear facing water
nozzles which project the drain cleaning kit
towards the blockage, like this.
Now, I’m wearing goggles like this because
I don’t want any nasty splashes coming into
my eyes. So begin by feeding the drain cleaning
kit inside your drain. Do this for a few feet
without pressure as you don’t want any nasty
splash-back. Once you’re confident turn
the pressure on and feed the pipe through.
Feed the kit through the length of the pipe
and back. Do this a couple of times just to
make sure that all the blockages are gone.
Once you release the pipe from the drain make
sure you do so without pressure, again, you
don’t want any nasty splash-backs. The kit
comes in seven and a half metre or a fifteen
metre length and is certainly cheaper than
paying for a professional drain cleaning service.
