hey guys welcome back to my channel and
today in this video I wanted to share
with you a really quick tip on how to
laminate
um a paper a card or whatever on one
side only like in this case I have this
flash card only laminated on one side
um maybe some of you already know this
tip if you do that's awesome if you
don't know this tip then I hope that you
watch this video and you find it helpful
so I'm laminating these flashcards these
are sight words flash cards um so here's
a really quick funny story if you want
to hear it I don't know if it's happened
to you
um I hope not but last week I had a
little incident with my printer what
happened was that I was searching online
for these um Dodge sight words I wanted
to find a list for them and I did
and here it is
all the way to third grade
so what I did is I downloaded the list
on my computer and then I hit the print
button and then I just left the
Homeschool Room and I went you know do
something else around the house
um a couple minutes later I hear the
sound the beeping sound from my printer
saying that that it was running out of
paper I was like what how come it was
just one page so I came over and I found
out my computer has been printed 38
pages of sight words
uh flash cards so I was saying no
oh my goodness
um and then you know I was like you know
let me just use them I mean whatever my
daughter is still learning sidewards so
I was just gonna cut them you know and
then hole punch them and use this ring
Grinders to hold them together and I
wasn't gonna laminate them because I
mean using 38 nominator sheets for
flashcards I'm like no but then I
decided to at least laminate one side of
it like the front side so I'm only using
19 you know I got it down to half and
what I do is this I grab one of the
laminator sheets and
um I open it up and I'm doing this with
one hand guys so bear with me and then I
grabbed one of the pages
face down
try to Center is
better as possible and then the other
one is facing up
so I'm if I did it right
all right
and then you get all the air out from
the sealed and towards the open end
all right so it's a little hard to do it
with one hand but here we go and then
I will take this to my nominator
and one of them is already
ready
and
make sure you Center it very well and
there you go I grab it so I'm just
pulling the other one that's ready
and let me show you
how they come out let me do one of the
first ones
so
I should have done this before I
recorded the video let me see if I can
do this
I have a my phone
on the table so you want to cut
let me see there you go you want to cut
around the line
not there but like around it let me do
it really quick
um
and for this I'm actually using a paper
cutter but
for the sake of the video I decided to
do it like this
all right
thank you and I'm sorry about that so I
cut out the side as you can see right
there and this just came apart because
you know they're not glued or anything
so what you do now just cut them you
know and then you have your cards
laminated only on one side
so now I'm gonna help punch them over
here in the corner and I'm gonna buy
them together with this ring so that's
the quick tip um I didn't even check if
there was on other videos around that
maybe a lot of people already know this
tip I just discovered it I'm new to
homeschooling and and not even newer to
having the laminator at home so I hope
this video was helpful uh to anyone out
there and if you have any suggestions to
me or any tips you want to give me
please feel free to do that in the
comment section down below thanks a lot
for watching and I'll see you next time
bye
