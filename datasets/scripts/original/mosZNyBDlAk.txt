so I have a roasted tomato that I need
to seed so I'm going to start out tomato
on my cutting board remove each end and
discard going to Slit down did the outer
flesh lengthwise as soon as I cut
through all the way to the core just
going to lay my knife horizontally on
The Cutting Board press down slightly on
the flush of the tomato and cut
horizontally so I'm just unrolling the
Tomato from around the core
which I then should be able to lift out
all the seeds the core of the Tomato use
the flat of my knife to clean up any
remaining
seeds and there we have a tomato it's
ready to use
