hello if you're a subscriber to my
Channel or if you've seen any of my
earlier videos this year you'll know
that I have a preference for sewing bra
root um in containers or germinating on
tissue
indoors and then transplanting them out
with small
seedlings when you transplant a be Road
out as a small seedling you're confident
that you've got U able bedro because
it's already growing and you're
confident of your
spacings um but prior to that um I used
to just saw the boat Road s
okay
um and they always been a bit of a
mystery of boot root seeds and I'll show
you why and I I expect you'll probably
saw your boot root seeds the same way
that I
do you'll get some out of the packet
like
this you will have probably drawn a line
on the soil on the dirt and that will be
about an inch deep you'll have taken out
um small fur about an inch deep and then
what you'll do
is you'll place your B out sides in
there and if you're struggling to see
these on this kitchen
table that's probably a good uh
replication of what you've got Outdoors
you will struggle to see these seeds
Okay now then the packet
SE um fin the when the bir roads start
growing thin them out uh to 4 in apart
okay so you've sewn your
seeds but you expect some of them might
not
germinate um so you've sewn them 2 in
apart the idea being um that when they
germinate if some of them don't
germinate then you've got your 4in space
in if they all germinate then it can
take some out is that is that reasonable
is that how you do it or do you just
shake them in out of the pocket and hope
for the
best well anyway you the packet asks you
to thin those out um to 4 in so if each
of these produce a boot route you'd be
taking that one out taking that one out
and taking that one out so something
like that and then you've got your 4in
spacing okay let's just pop these seeds
back where they
were right now if you can see these
seeds I think you'll agree that they are
reasonably equally
spared do you agree with that they're
reasonably equally
spared so why is it when there these
boot root start to appear once these
guys have
germinated you'll find that a boot root
drawing shoulder to shoulder right next
to one
another what's happened
there you've taken the time to try and S
these guys thinly you're fairly
confident that these are at least 2 in
apart and yet when the germinate you've
got beetroot growing shoulder to
shoulder what's happened there it's a
mystery well I think I might have solved
that mystery in fact I know I've solved
that
mystery
um now I sold some beetroot earlier um
this month and I sold them in a pot okay
and I'm confident of the spacings and
I'm confident how many seeds I've swn
I've actually sewn 11 seeds in each
pot this is a bait rout called
cylindra and as the name implies it's
cylindrical a l to me sounds carrot
shaped we can grow carrots in pots we
can grow cylindrical beetroot in pots
can't we uh but let me get some out let
me get those planted and let's get this
video
finished okay that's the standard straw
colored seed uh okay let's SE these guys
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
going
to finish this off just the same way as
I finished the uh car deal
off by covering these then firming it
down with the pizza base then sprin it
with
water um and then we'll be able to see
we'll do a germination comp parison
shall we we've got
cardal uh we've got the cylindra both
went in on the same day at the same
time uh yeah we'll do a a a germination
comparison as well as part of this
video okay I've done two pots so we
should see 11 be Ro if all the seeds
germinate shouldn't
we right this is where we solve the
mystery let's go outdoors and have a
look at these beetro because they've
started to germinate come
on let's do
this let stop raining let's go
outdoors and have a look at these
germinated boot load seeds in a
pot
after just about 2 days of non-stop rain
and strong winds we've managed to get
out into the garden so I've got those
boot rout uh that I saw in a pot the pot
I'm going to put up is the pot of uh
cardu the boot rad s in this pot is
cardu but from
uh the video that you you've just
watched you'll have seen me
saw 11 seeds 11 be rout seeds so we
should have 11 be rout would you agree
that's if they've all germinated let's
say if they've all
germinated what do you
think how earlier I said that no matter
how much you space You V outsides out
you'll probably find some of grown
shoulder Tosh shoulder and it's a bit of
a
mystery if you're an experienced
Gardener it's no
mystery um but if you're new to
gardening it is a mystery it's got to be
unless somebody tells you about this
unless you saw seeds as thinly as I do
you'd probably never tumble this
yourself but look at these two
guys shoulder to shoulder what's
happened there only planted one seed at
that station you saw me roll a pebble
out of the way with my finger plant a
seed look at these two
guys shoulder to
shoulder there's another two you might
not see that small one you might
shoulder to shoulder two more shoulder
what's all that
about well I'll tell you what it's all
about the boot root seeds aren't
actually boot root seeds at all the
beetro Clusters clusters of seeds now
clearly a cluster is more than one but
that's not always the case so when you
plant a beetroot seed cluster you may
actually just get one one one one one
one but if that cluster has more than
one seed in it if it has two seeds or
three seeds or maybe four seeds they're
going to grow shoulder to
shoulder shoulder to shoulder shoulder
to shoulder shoulder to shoulder
shoulder to shoulder that's a mystery
that's a mystery solved Beed root seeds
quite often are not a single seed but a
cluster of seeds doesn't matter how
thinly you plant them you're going to
get beet Ro growing shoulder to
shoulder and now your choice is do you
thin them out or do you just let them
grow your
choice anyway how many did we plant here
Molly how many did we plant
here 11 yeah we planted 11 okay let's go
around the 11 stations and see if all
the Clusters
germinated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 one seed
didn't
germinate um so we've got 10 out of 11
if you want to work a percentage out for
me you
can um 10 seeds germinated out of 11 10
seed clusters now then let's count how
many be we've got
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
14 we only saw 11 beat Road seed
clusters we've got 14 beat
Road anyway if it was a mystery it's now
solved it wasn't a mystery thanks for
watching anyway um I'll need to decide
what I'm I'm going to do with these guys
now because there are too many in this
poot really I suspect what I'll do is
I'll try and thin these guys out and if
I can get a decent one I'll pop it in
that station there and we'll grow on 11
be road is that a
deal okay this is homegrown veg signing
out
