this video is to show you how to hook up
a siren so that when it's tripped it
will turn one of your power doors
off my settlement has uh pretty much
barricades on all four
sides way over there and then this is
the only spot that people can come in
and the idea is at the lookout here
we'll see someone coming
and pull the
alarm shutting the door and not letting
anyone
in then when they turn it back or when
they turn it off the door goes back on
and they actually will do that when they
see if they're near it and they see
someone they actually will go over there
and turn it on and for the most part
I've seen when um everyone is cleared
out they'll they'll turn it um off which
then opens the door back up so instead
of trying to trace all those
wires um I thought I would just show you
this kind of demonstration area over
here so what you're going to need is a
generator the
siren two logic gates you need the
and and the
not and one of the power
doors First Step hook up power to the
siren
into the red lead on the
end Next Step take the siren and go to
that same red lead so both of these are
acting as
inputs the output of the end goes to the
red lead on the knot and the knot black
lead goes to your powered
door so why does the door
open well right now try to get in there
so I can see see the
menu right now it's looking for both
signals to be on so since only one of
them is um the the
generator um it's sending a
zero up to the knot gate the knot gate
basically uh reverses that to an on or a
one and sends power to the
door when you turn the siren on
now both of the inputs on the and are
met so it's sending a
one to the
knot and then it's negating that and
reversing that to a zero which is
essentially cutting the power to the
door well I hope that helps in showing
some of the uses of the logic gates and
adding some functionality to the doors
and the siren I'm still thinking of
other things that I could do with that I
think somehow powering it so that some
red lights go on uh could be feasible
with this if you have any questions or
comments please leave them below thanks
for watching
