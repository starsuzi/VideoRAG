hi everyone so today i'm going to be
showing you how i like to clean a bath
and body works candle jar
okay so first i'm going to be putting
the candle in the freezer
and let it sit in there for a couple of
hours to harden
so that it's ready for me to remove
now the tool i'm using might seem a bit
weird it's actually an
apple corer it's something that i've
used for years to remove candles
out of jars and it just works for me i
mean you can use
anything sharp probably a knife or just
any
other type of sharp tool should do
i just find that the apple core works
well for me
now the candle wicks are the most
difficult part
because they are glued down i'm just
going to do my best to remove them with
my hands
and later on i might have to soak them
in some hot water
to get the rest of them up now for the
easiest part
which is the label on the front of the
candle and that literally just
peels right off and
since i kept everything on a paper towel
while doing all this
the cleanup is as simple as wrapping it
all up and
throwing it away now it's time to
soak those annoying
candle wicks out of the jar with some
hot water and just
some regular dish soap
haha got you you little
now i'm just going to remove the bottom
label with some hot water
and a lot of elbow grease
and a little tip when you're doing this
over the sink you want to keep a paper
towel or something underneath
and that will just catch the sticker so
that it's not going down the drain
now the best way i've found to remove
the glue residue in the candle jar is to
dry it completely with paper towels
and then use a dry paper towel and some
good old-fashioned baking soda
and just kind of buff at it and that
should get every last remainder of glue
residue in your candle jar
now the final step is just washing your
candle jar
and the lid with some soapy water
you're done
okay so that's how i like to clean a
bath and body works candle jar let me
know in the comments below if you have
any questions
or video ideas and that's
it thank you so much for watching
you
