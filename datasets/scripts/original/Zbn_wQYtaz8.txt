hi i'm lucas cronin i'm max o'brien i'm
mark o'connor we're transitioning your
students in mercymount talk to lee and
today we're going to teach you how to
build that
and these are the tools we're going to
be using today
this is a saw its main purpose will be
used for cutting up the wood
this is a hammer it'll be used along
with the nails to hold together our
hotel
it is also advised to have a responsible
person with you to help with the
construction of your insect hotel
the best place to build your insect
hotel is very bushes or trees
and insects which has man-made structure
made from natural materials for example
a pallet this is really good material
because it is sturdy and it is
tires are not advisable because they
leave out toxic chemicals
bricks are very good for an insect fail
because they're very sturdy and they're
very good for sports
you can recycle pipes and bottles to put
into your instagram
you can also use natural wood to add
more structural integrity
you can use many different natural
materials to invite many different
insects into your insect hotel for
example twigs this will invite ladybirds
another good material that you can put
into your insect hotel is sawdust for
filling up the gaps
it's good to nail the structure together
to give it stability
now that the structure's stable we're
going to add more pallets and add more
layers for more materials
fun
as you can see the guys here are filling
up the intake of hair with sticks
now the guys are filling up the second
there with sawdust
the guys are now filling up the interior
with dead leaves
as you can see here lucas is starting
the pipe so we'll fit into our insect
hotel so we finished cutting up these
pipes and we put into our insect hotel
then we went looking around and we found
a few bottles as you can see marcus is
cutting it up
and we're going to fill it with leaves
and natural materials and we're going to
put in terrain we are now finding off
our pipes and fossils with natural
materials such as grass this is our
finished insects and stuff we are hoping
some plugs will move in soon don't
