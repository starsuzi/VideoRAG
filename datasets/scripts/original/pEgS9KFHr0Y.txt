hey everyone carlos vargas here and i'm
at international food gourmet at 57 oak
street in brockton my favorite italian
specialty store in the south shore
and i'm with adelina armas at
international food gourmet and today
she's going to show us
how to do a turducken adelina could you
tell us a little bit about your business
yes sure well we've been in business
since 1978 my dad started it um
he was in the meat market and he wanted
to get into retail so he brought us up
him and his three daughters came up and
we started
uh selling italian food products
and we cut fresh meats we have a full
line of deli we do our own prepared
foods we grate our own cheeses
we package our we make our own bread
crumbs and so we start from scratch and
throughout the day we just keep on
creating meals and servicing the
brockton area
and vargas insurance loves their
catering we use adelina and her business
for all of our catering lunches today
adelina is going to show us her famous
turducken we're going to she's going to
show us about uh how to wrap a turkey
around a chicken breast around a duck
breast with some stuffing
so we're going to get going right now
okay so i started with the turkey breast
the boneless turkey breast and i removed
the skin because i like the skin to be
on the top and not underneath and inside
so i just
butterflied it open
and
i'm going to season the first layer
with some salt a little pepper and some
garlic
okay and then i'm gonna do the bread
stuffing first
and i'm gonna put the uh the duck before
the chicken because tur duck ends so
i think that's how it's gonna go
and i just do a flat layer
of the bread stuffing
try to get it you know so that's even
all across i kind of leave the edges not
covered so to roll and wrap
okay and then once you've got that
i lost my paper towel sorry
then i'm going to put the duck
which i'm just going to lay
right on top
also a little bit of seasoning for that
yeah what are you using as a seasoning
salt pepper and garlic
the stuffings have plenty of seasoning
and there's onion and olive oil so just
want to season up the meat a little bit
do you have a favorite stuffing recipe
or is it something that you just kind of
i've seen you create on the fly we use
our own croutons
and then you know i saute celery and
onions sometimes it depends on sometimes
i put mushrooms this one here is a
sausage
i love arugula i love kale so i could
even be sauteing that and that is what's
in the vegetable stuffing i have arugula
in there i have spinach i have kale
mushrooms and onion so um
the bread stuffing of course is with the
croutons but that one there is
you know gluten-free so you can even
make a gluten-free one with just that if
you'd like so now that we have the duck
and it's seasoned then take the
vegetable stuffing
and it is a little juicy and i'm not
squeezing it out because the juices is
good for the breast
okay once that's done and the last layer
is the chicken
just put that on top
and again you're going to season it just
a little bit on the chicken
were those breasts easy to open up to
butterfly or well
for me it is
yeah i just take a whole breast and i
start at the skinniest end
and i just open it up and use the palm
of my hand to feel and then you flip
over and then you turn it around and do
it on the same side
and um see you know if it's too thick
you could always pound it out
you know if you're not used to filleting
but you could always pound it out to
make it um as thin as you want
but if somebody wants some filet you
they can stop in and buy them and you
can flame for it yeah and we even fillet
the ones that are you know bone on we
take the bone off so that some people
like to stuff chicken breasts with skin
on we can even do that for them
okay so now i'm just going to wrap and
what i just do is i bring in all the
edges
and sometimes it's messy and sometimes
not depends on how much stuffing we're
sticking in but i just keep on rolling
and get it in
and
once i get all my tucks in
i i'm going to tie it with some string
and i call it the silvia knot because my
dad tied different than everybody else
in the united states took me about a
month
but i did get it
so you take the skin
and lay it on the top
it's good for the roast
and then you'll string it back up
so you wrap it around
tie it up
then you're going to wrap the opposite
way
and then you're going to wrap it up tie
it
in sections and i start in the middle
and just give it a tug so
not too tight um i tighten it a lot
because the stuffing
you know and as it um as it's cooking
sometimes it you know deteriorates some
so you don't want a lot of pockets so i
i do a little bit on the tighter side
it's just to make it more
so that the filling stays glued to the
meats
and then you just wrap you know you tie
up
you know so that it's tied evenly this
one here i'm going to do one more
towards the edge
and then do the other side
just clean off anything you don't want
hanging
and then this will go in a pan and what
i do is i flip it over i season the
bottom a little salt a little pepper
little garlic
and then i flip it over and i do an
olive oil rub on the top to season that
and then i roast it this um
it should reach to a 165 temp
so the first one i cooked this morning
was in about 2 hours and 15 minutes to
reach i cut i cook it covered until the
last 40 minutes
so then you can get the nice browning on
you on your turkey
and that's that
so now we're going to take foil and we
can't tend it you don't want it to stick
to the top of the roast
um if you're afraid it will pam's
miracle worker you can spray the tin
foil with can and then it you know
guarantees it won't stick but just to
try to just give it a pop and then tuck
in your edges
and then you just put it right in the
oven alrighty now we're just going to
pop it in the oven
and let it roast
for two hours and 15 minutes
approximately at 350.
but use your thermometer because
everybody's oven's different and it's
you know you you open up you you baste
the temperature drops you're putting it
back in it's got to rise again so i do
recommend the thermometer and it's got
to be registered 165 for in the internal
temperature alrighty so the roast is
done i've been letting it rest about
half hour to 40 minutes it reached an
internal temperature of 165
and now we're just going to place it on
a clean cutting board make sure you
clean all your surfaces and disinfect
because you know you had raw poultry on
your surfaces
so i'm just going to go along and cut
the strings
and you just have to cut them the way
you put them on you know
the opposite way
and then you just pull them down
and then you're going to find the little
side one which is
most difficult
let me take this off see how that goes
and see maybe i can find it
so that's all
three this way
i must have caught it because i don't
see it
okay here we go
and then this way
so i'm going to cut it in half so you
can see what it looks like but normally
you would start at one end so i just
want to cut it down the middle so that
you can get the effect of what it looks
like on the inside
and this has been sitting for 35 minutes
about 30 30 minutes 35 minutes and then
you got your turkey your stuffing and
the um
duck is in the on the inside i don't
know if you can see it on that one but
this one here and then your chicken is
right on the outer edge
oh that looks delicious
and there you go bon appetit
thank you avelina thank you so much
thank you carlos enjoy the day yeah i
will definitely will thank you
