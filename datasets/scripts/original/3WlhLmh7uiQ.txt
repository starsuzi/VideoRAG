So AC Family, I felt it was time to revert
back for a bit to some classic ant keeping,
just ants and a setup.
And it just so happens, that one of my most
cherished ant colonies has been due for a
very long time now for a new ant farm upgrade.
It's been awhile since we heard about the
Dark Knights, my black crazy ants currently
living in their two story ant setup, but that
ends now. I had the perfect home waiting for
them to move in. It was time for some innovative
ant housing technology, I can't wait to show
you.
Please SUBSCRIBE to my channel, and hit the
bell icon. Welcome to the AC Family. Enjoy!
Behold in it's glorious floral immaculacy!
A brilliant splash of spring is coming up
for the Dark Knights! Isn't nature just gorgeous?
But there's something about this ant palace
that will surprise you, and just so you know,
what you see here is only a taste of what
else I've created. Wait until you guys see
the whole setup and the grand event that happens
at the end! But before we get to that and
the big move into the new territories, let's
have a look at the lucky ant colony to receive
the new home.
For months and months, all you fans of the
Dark Knights have begged and pleaded for an
update. The last dedicated video we made on
these gorgeous gals was way back in August
of last year, and before that all the way
back in January of last year! That's quite
the lack of spotlight for the Dark Knights,
and for that I truly apologize.
The reason for this? They simply have been
the perfect, predictable, un-eventful, non-crisis,
easy going ant colony I've ever owned. The
perfect ant colony, I would say! They're friendly,
never tried to escape, ate well, were always
intimidating enough to keep wild ants from
breaking into their setup, and best of all,
grew bigger, but rather gradually and non-explosively.
Essentially, creating a video about them would
have taken 5 minutes tops and would include
nothing new.
But that ends today, and you nor they will
believe how much of life a change is coming
their way. You will be shocked and delighted
by the end of this video!
Now because the Dark Knights have been a simple-to-keep
ant colony, I wanted to keep things that way.
The past months saw extravagent, complex ant
setups with rivers, and river beasts, lights,
and automatic rain systems, but these setups
made way for a whole slew of complications
and challenges which we were forced to deal
with and figure out on the spot.
But not this time. I promised myself that
with these Dark Knights, we would aim for
beauty as usual, but keep things simple, because
they too were a beautiful yet simple ant colony.
I also noticed that a lot of you since watching
these ant videos have taken an interest in
ant-keeping yourselves, which is amazing,
and for those of you in North America, Europe,
and Northern Asia, there isn't a better time
to go ahead and dive head first into the hobby,
since this year's ant nuptial flights are
just getting started! I'll explain more about
that in a bit, but for all of you wannabe
ant keepers buzzing with ant love, I'll be
including pointers for you here and there
on the basics of ant keeping, while we build
a beautiful, simple setup for our beloved
Dark Knights.
So the current setup of the Dark Knights has
been sufficient for the ant colony for over
a year. The colony is currently inhabiting
a Hybrid Nest and an Uncle Milton Ant Farm,
but the majority of the colony resides in
this rooster plant pot within a rubbermaid
bin.
This colony actually has the greatest length
of running area of over 40 feet. If you recall
from a past video, I punched holes into my
wall to create a super long network of tubing
which ran two stories high down to the top
of my fridge. This was the only colony that
had access to my first floor because these
were the only ants that could survive the
cool air-conditioned climate, outside of the
Ant Room. Any time they got too cold, they
would simply migrate upstairs to the ant room
without a fuss. They loved moving around,
and nomadism is a very big part of this species
lifestyle. Black crazy ants are very much
so travelers.
And this also holds true on a global scale.
Black Crazy ants have managed to invade almost
all parts of the world, hitching rides in
cargo, on ships, and in planes. I have seen
Black Crazy Ants in nearly all tropical and
subtropical countries of the world that I've
visited. Reports claim they've even been spotted
in temperate places like New York and Quebec,
Canada where they managed to survive winters
by living indoors! Scientists aren't sure
where black crazy ants originally came from
but it is suspected that they originated in
India.
So now that you know a little about these
ladies, let's take a look at the colony. If
you recall from a past video, these ants are
special in that the queens of this species
have a unique ability to create males that
are genetically unrelated, which means these
males can mate with their own sister queens
and it not be genetically incestual.
You see, in most regular ants, the queen will
give birth to male and female alates, meaning
reproductive virgin males and females born
with wings. These alates wait for the big
nuptial flights that happen only during a
specific season of the year. When nuptial
flight actually happens, usually in Spring
or Summer in temprate regions, the alates
take to the air and fly to meet other alates
from neighbouring nests in order to mate on
wing. After the big mating session the males
die, since they're no longer needed in the
ant world, but the now pregnant female alates
break off their wings, and go off to start
new ant colonies. This by the way is the stage
where you need to catch them if you're looking
to start your own ant colony. Once you find
a queen, you put her into a test tube setup,
and she will lay eggs for you which will grow
into worker ants which will begin your ant
colony. If you want some tutorials on this
start-up process watch this helpful playlist
here, after watching this video.
Now this whole process is completely hacked
in Black Crazy Ants. First off, black crazy
ants are polygynous which means queens will
band together and form massive super colonies.
Most regular ant species are monogynous and
won't tolerate another egg-laying queen in
the same nest.
Second, this species doesn't need to have
nuptial flights which tend to be feast days
for birds and other predators. Instead, black
crazy ants mate inside the nests, completely
skipping the nuptial flight step! Now coupled
with the fact that they are able to mate incestually
by family tree but not incestually by genetics,
that means a black crazy ant colony can amass
a huge super colony with thousands if not
millions of queen ants all laying eggs and
creating an enormously, explosive supercolony...
hence black crazy ants being the most successful
ants at world domination.
Now the Dark Knights here started with only
two egg-laying queens when I first got them,
but today, I'm guessing there are more queens
in this colony. If there are, I hope to find
out and spot them during the move into the
new home. But see get this, AC Family.
This all really makes me appreciate and love
the Dark Knights even more, because despite
an ability to explode in population, it seems
the ants instead know their existing parameters,
they understand the regular amount of food
they receive every day, they know their territory
limitations, and choose to simply not explode
in size under our care so they could live
comfortably.
Well, it was time to give them some growing
room, AC Family! They've come a long way and
totally deserved it.
So here lay what would be their new territories.
Behold, these large crystal palaces known
as the AC Outworld 2.0 from our shop at AntsCanada.com.
Ok, by the way, did you guys even know we
had a shop? I haven't mentioned it in my videos
recently but, if this is news to you, we do
and we sell all easy-to-use ant keeping gear,
shipped worldwide with full customer email
support to help.
I said crystal but these AC Outworlds are
actually made of ABS plastic, making it a
sturdy home for my ants. I'm actually super
excited to use this new design of outworld
for the Dark Knights!
Now if you're at home wondering what is an
outworld, let's break it down into simple
terms. When keeping a pet ant colony, you
need two parts: a nest where the ants live
and where all the young and queen stay, and
you also need what's called an outworld, basically
an area the ants can forage for their food,
establish garbage sites for you to clean up
weekly, and essentially all the ants' natural
outdoor activities.
In some cases as is the case for the Selva
de Fuego, the Hacienda Del Dorado, El Dragon
Island, The Shire, and The Grove, the nest
and outworld is the same container. But some
ant keepers like to keep the nest and outworld
separate, so they can see what's happening
inside the nest by way of formicarium, and
simply connect the nest with the outworld
with tubes.
Me, I like both setups but today I will be
creating the two-in-one setup for the Dark
Knights, because I don't need to see everything
that's going on inside the nest. Since most
of my ant colonies are huge with millions
of members, I've really become a fan lately
of seeing more of the outworld ant activity
and simply settle with seeing what the ants
decide to show me in visible areas next to
the glass! Had the Dark Knights been a small
ant colony, I probably would have went for
a separate formicarium and outworld setup
because, less colony members means less ants
in the outworld, and most of the action happening
inside the nest.
Now check out these awesome outworld features!
First, size wise, it's quite large! 12”
long X 6” wide X 6 ½ ” tall, which is
actually 10% larger than the old model, and
what makes it great is that it is rounded
and seamless, meaning no corners for the ants
to climb up, which is exactly what happened
in the Selva de Fuego.
Now check out this awesome lid! It's full
of microholes for good ventilation, and what
I love is that now I don't need to remove
the whole lid if I don't need to. I can just
open this plug and drop in the prey insects
through this chute. It's good to have a securely
fitting cover on an outworld if possible not
only to keep ants in but to keep other things
out, in my case, geckoes and even wild intruding
ants whose name we shall not speak, not the
the Dark Knights can't whoop Pharaoh ant gasters,
anyway but you know what I'm saying.
Now check this out! This middle plate pops
off leaving this upper lip under which I place
my ant barrier, be it petroleum jelly, baby
powder mixed with alcohol, or fluon. Today
I will be using baby powder with rubbing alcohol.
With the barrier there I can work around the
outworld and not worry about ants escaping.
Check out how cool the back is! This is where
my AC Large tubing fits securely, no glue
needed. Now you might be wondering what these
two smaller holes are for. Well, ants sometimes
decide to treat their outworlds like giant
nest chambers, which can be annoying if you've
spent time and money making or buying a formicarium
for them to nest in, but a secret is that
ants will not nest in a space that has wind,
so if the ants start nesting in an outworld,
all you need to do is get a simple aquarium
fish air pump and attach it to one or both
of these holes. This microwind will be enough
of a message to the ants to let them know
the outworld is not a nest. It's the outside!
Cool right? OK, AC Family, wanna see it's
coolest feature? If you're like me and space
is a limiting factor, the AC Outworld 2.0
is amazing because it is now stackable! The
bottom plate pops right off and I can stack
1 or 2 more outworlds on top! I can even keep
the plate on and make it a two floor outworld
if I wanted! Though technically the outworlds
can stack infinitely high, and you can make
a huge tower, I probably wouldn't recommend
stacking it higher than three outworlds unless
you're absolutely sure it won't topple over.
Also worth mentioning guys, if you do ever
end up getting one of these outworlds for
your ants, you should probably silicone the
floor plate to all base Outworlds so there
is no leakage if you ever pour water inside.
But for me, I love that I can now increase
my ants' space and use less shelf room. This
stacking feature opens a whole new door of
outworld possibilities, and speaking of which,
AC Family it is time to do what we love and
do best... Let's create some ant worlds!
Let's not let the Dark Knights down!
With some soil, selected plants and decor,
and a whole lot of ant love I went straight
to work. When making these ant worlds, I have
a rough idea what the end result may look
like, but I can never truly see what it will
look like until I've actually finished. Overall,
I knew I wanted to offer the Dark Knights
a lot more digging nesting space, as well
as a super intricate insect wonderland in
which the Dark Knights can frolick.
And after several hours of work, the ant worlds
were done.
AC Family, I'm pleased to present to you,
the soon-to-be ant worlds of the Dark Knights.
Behold!
This is what I call the "Tour des Fleurs",
which in French means the Tower of Flowers.
Bursting red and yellow blossoms from a deep
bed of soil, a trubute to their sister senior
colonies the Fire Nation and the Golden Empire,
but more importantly representing Africa and
Europe, two continents their species have
successfully invaded. The yellow starburst
flower to the left is a Gerbera species, native
to Africa, and of course to the right, some
tulips reminiscent of Netherlands and Turkey.
I can't wait for the Dark Knights to be climbing
these landmarks!
Next, I present to you the "Zen Jardim", representing
Asia and South America, also two continents
conquered by the black crazy ant species.
"Zen" from the Japanese school of Mahayana
Buddhism emphasizing the value of meditation
and intuition, "jardim" from the Brazilian
Portuguese word for Garden. It is a gorgeous
network of velvety moth orchids, and at the
foot of these towering orchid trees, is a
tiny wooden hut, as a symbol of how organic
and balanced this colony has been over the
entire course of their stay with us. I think
they'll really love this ant world, too.
And finally, up next, I'm pleased to present
to you the Billabong Hills, representing North
America and Australia. Again, two continents
conquered by Black Crazy Ants. It's made of
deep green mossy hilltops and stones and a
gorgeous water lotus plant towering high into
the apex of this Ant World.
All three of these Ant Worlds are gorgeous
and distinct, but there is something that
all three of these Ant Worlds have in common
that may surprise you. Ready for it? I wanted
to keep the setups simple, so the plants chosen
for these Ant Worlds are all artificial. That's
right, the plants are fake, meaning they don't
need light, water, fertilization, nor pruning,
and will stay in their current shape, bloom,
and size forever. I bought these artificial
plants at a department store. You'll be surprised
how realistic many of the available artificial
plants, used for home decor, are nowadays!
If you wanna try your hand at incorporating
artificial plants, by the way, into your ant
outworld setups, and you can't find any at
a department store or dollar store, feel free
to check our great Biome Kits at our shop
that helps us ant keepers recreate a forest,
rainforest, or desert habitat within an outworld.
Alright and now for the moment of truth. It
was time to release the Dark Knights into
these new territories. I setup up the Ant
Worlds all around the Ant Room and connected
them. All unused holes were plugged up with
an AC Plug which comes with the AC Outworld
kit. I placed my barrier on all Outworld top
lips.
It was crazy to know, no pun intended, that
the Dark Knights had been treading on the
same territory for over a year, and that starting
tonight they would explore and conquer some
new lands.
The Dark Knights seemed unaware something
was about to happen. I hadn't watered their
rooster plant pot for days so the soil was
dry to encourage the ants to move out and
into the hydrated soils of their new Ant Worlds.
So AC Family, here goes nothing! Let's do
this! I took another AC Outworld, filled it
with moist soil, placed a clear pillar on
top of the soil, and boom! I placed their
entire rooster plant pot onto the pillar and
sat back to watch!
Immediately the ants went into hi-jinx! They
were startled and scrambled all around eventually
making their way down to the moist soils of
the outworld. My hopes were that the ants
would discover the rich soils below and want
to move out of the dry pot and into new territory.
So far, it looked like the plan was working.
Ants scrambled up and down spreading news
of the new soils which lay below. The rooster
plant pot sat heavily on the pillar, but I
knew this setup was only going to be temporary
until the entire colony was moved out. I couldn't
wait for that to happen.
I resolved to retire for the night, and leave
the setup to allow the Dark Knights to move
in peace. But AC Family, you won't believe
what I woke up to, in the middle of the night.
Gasp!
Just playing. Imagine I left you hanging there.
No, this is supposed to be a simple and complicated-free
episode, which is why I woke up. Basically,
I got paranoid and decided last minute to
switch plans to a safer and simpler approach
to having the ants move in. I returned the
rooster pot into the rubbermaid bin and attached
their rubbermaid bin to the AC Outworld, allowing
the Dark Knights to move on their own terms
and in a comfortable manner, comfortable both
for the ants and for us. The huge plant pot
balancing act on a flimsy clear pillar made
me super paranoid and kept me from falling
asleep! I couldn't allow for the pot to topple
over somehow and unleash the Dark Knights
into my home! That would have been disastrous!
Better safe than sorry, right guys?
So I let this setup be, so the ants could
move in on their own.
By morning, the ants seemed in a rush. The
move had begun. Ants were now forming trails
within the tubes and the Ant Worlds and they
had already begun excavation work in the soils.
Despite the commotion, it seemed the ants
had not yet begun to move the brood, which
meant the colony was still refusing to leave
the safety of their rooster pot, which was
fine for now. In time, perhaps when the tunnels
were excavated, the Dark Knights would move
the brood and queens en masse into the new
territories.
I made sure to provide the ants a big dish
of raw honey to give them all the energy they
needed, to fuel this massive rehoming and
nest excavation operation. The ants filled
up their social stomachs to distribute the
honey to the other Dark Knight members within
the nest.
By night, I saw something that made my heart
jump for joy! The Dark Knights were now shipping
in the brood! Yes! It was official. They were
moving in the babies. Those white things are
pupae, ant teenagers waiting to become adult
ants.
The ants were in more of a dash now, as this
phase of the emmigration involved movement
of the most important members of the colony,
namely the brood and the queens. This phase
was super critical and dangerous! In the wild,
this mass exodus exposes the brood and queens
to outside dangers like predators and the
elements. It is so important the Dark Knights
work as swiftly and efficiently as possible.
At first the ants didn't seem to have any
rhyme or reasoning to where they were locating
the brood but it wasn't long until they established
a trail which would take all moving ants into
a tube that lead them to the Tour de Fleurs.
Less ants were drinking from the honey now.
They got enough of their fill, and need all
the ant power they can get to get this mass
emmigration completed and the brood and queens
to safety.
Speaking of which, there's one of the queens
now. I'm always amazed at how quick the queens
of this species are. They're just as fast
and nimble as the workers. She made her way
to the Tour de Fleur. So far, things were
going perfectly as planned.
I returned to the Dark Knights in the wee
hours of the night to check up on them, and
I came to this.
An awe-inspiring, mass assembly of brood and
workers! I held my breath as I looked around
at the huge throngs of Dark Knight pupae which
hung in clumps all around the outworld. And
AC Family, look!
Dark Knight queens were everywhere! There
were so many queen ants gathered in this massive
colony convocation. I knew it! The Dark Knights
now had many queen ants, expanding from just
the original two from when they first started.
I bet, the Dark Knights have hundreds if not
thousands of queens. It was all just amazing
to see! And it looked like the ants were treating
this entire outworld like one giant nest chamber.
I totally could have placed an air pump into
one of these two ports to send these now nesting
ants, off into one of the other Outworlds,
but no. I didn't want to. Instead, down on
a knee, as I filmed them wide-eyed and spell-bound,
I realized that never before have I ever had
the opportunity to appreciate the majestic
presence of the Dark Knights like I did now
in this moment. It was truly special and I
was honoured to be able to film it to you,
guys.
Before shutting off the lights to head to
bed, I uttered a verbal 'thank you' to the
colony that had always been nothing less than
awesome and worry-free. Enjoy the new kingdoms,
ladies, and have a swift remaining emmigration.
By morning, the Dark Knights had completely
moved out of their rooster pot and were now
all in their new territories!
I loved watching the ants climbing the plants,
the vines, branches, flowers, and stems. They
formed incredible winding trails to and from
various tubes in the Ant Worlds, clearly loving
all of this new running and climbing space.
Let's start way up here. The gateway outworld
is now their main feeding arena so
Then we proceed down into the Tour des Fleurs,
which is connected to the Zen Jardim, which
is connected to the tube which takes the ants
out of the Ant Room and downstairs, and also,
by way of a very long tube to Billabong Hills
which sits high above the Selva de Fuego.
The Billabong Hills attaches to their old
outworld and finally the Uncle Milton Ant
Farm.
Their setup was actually now extended an extra
15 feet, making the total travel distance
of the Dark Knight's kingdom a whopping 55
ft! The ants had by now successfully completed
a lot of their subterranean construction,
having built caverns which could partially
be seen against the sides of the outworlds.
I knew that within these dark underground
catacombs, they had cozily stored all the
colony's brood and guided all queens inside
before sunrise.
Their setup looked a lot more neat and tidy
now, beautiful, yet simple. It had a good
energy, and best of all it was low-maintenance.
I just had to water each Ant World a little
every few days to keep the soils moist.
And of course, as is AC tradition, a house
warming gift. I offered these ladies a huge
cockroach for an emmigration well-done.
So AC Family, it turns out, it's not always
drama or crises-management in the Anitverse.
If you keep things simple, it means less variables
to control and a more predictable outcome,
and I guess this applies to more than just
ant keeping. I realized today, as I watched
the ants frolicking their new Ant Worlds and
devouring their house-warming gift, that there's
beauty in simplicity.
But then I noticed this... Oh no! Look! It
seems the scent of the cockroach gift has
attracted some scouts. Trying desperately
to find a way into the Dark Knights' territories:
the ants whose name we shall not speak. But
don't worry... This is not a cliffhanger.
These wild pharaoh ants are failing at finding
a way in. Thank goodness for these new Outworlds!
