in today's video i'm going to be
actually sharing a tip i learned from a
friend and as soon as i found the sound
like i have to share this with my
youtube subscribers
um it's basically something to do with
this bottle now let me explain the story
a colleague of mine at work
each time before she goes into the
bathroom she takes this a similar
looking bottle to this one
and
i see that there's a couple of times and
i was like okay i have to ask her what
is she doing
so basically what she does is she fills
a bottle similar to this with
disinfectant and water and uses it to
disinfect the toilet seat
the um doorknob
the
what are they called
the tap the handles whatever
so she sprays all that
everywhere so basically after she's
sprayed everything she wipes it off with
tissue and then she feels much safer or
cleaner
using it
to do is you take an empty bottle um
this is a spray bottle
okay
poof
anyway smells of detail now
you take disinfectants you can take
either detol or duck and this looks like
i'm advertising for households
okay
they want to do is you fill the bottle
about half of it with disinfectant the
rest with water because it can be quite
strong i just pray spread some here and
it's
a bit i think i have to add more water
to this so the way to do it is um you
mix it all up and when you go into the
bathroom you take this with you and you
spray whatever you want to disinfect the
door handle the faucet
the knobs the sink the toilet seat
you lift the toilet seat to disinfect
you disinfect the
ablution faucet whatever you want to
disinfect you do it with this by
spraying
whatever is in the bottle and then
wiping it off with tissue
and using the bathroom where however you
want to use the bathroom
and i feel this for women is ideal
especially women who have kids
but even if you're just using the
bathroom and you know how public
bathroom can be very uncomfortable
sometimes it's not as clean as we like
to have them and this is just a safer
and not safer but you know kinda you're
at ease
knowing that you are touching something
which is germ free
which is disinfectant basically so
anyway i really wanted to share this tip
as soon as i heard it and
if you're in a man wondering where you
can get this i think you can find these
kind of bottles at marks and spencers i
found mine from carrefour in moscow city
center
where they sell the hair and
hair accessories don't ask me what this
was doing with the hair excesses i have
no idea but that's where i found it and
yeah i hope you enjoyed this video and
i'll see you all in the next video
