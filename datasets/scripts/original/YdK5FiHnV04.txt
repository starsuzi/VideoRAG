welcome to cake playground where it's
all about the
fun this lesson is on how to make a swan
from modeling
chocolate these cute little decorations
can be used on top of a wedding cake or
on cupcakes they're tasty and they're
cute you will need the following
materials and
Equipment a 1-in ball of white modeling
chocolate a small rolling pin a gumpaste
tool offset spatula and small leaf
cutter and some
cornstarch we're going to start by
breaking off a small piece of the
chocolate and setting it aside so break
off about one4 of the ball and set it
aside later to make the
wings next we're going to take the large
piece of chocolate and roll it between
our hands into a smooth
ball
after you've smoothed the ball of
chocolate you're going to use your
fingertips to start shaping a tube this
tube will later become the head and neck
of the Swan I've used a ruler here to
give you reference point as to how long
it should
be next you're going to shape the
tail so turn the body around from the
opposite end from the neck you're going
to pull out a piece of the ball to shape
the tail you're going to use your
fingertips to smooth the tail and smooth
the body to get out any bumps and
bulges now we're going to bend the tube
back to form the head and neck so pull
the tube back at about a 45° angle to
the body and then pull the head over to
form an S shape and then use your
fingertips to shape the pointy end of
the swan's nose
we're going to use the ball of chocolate
we set aside to make the
wings dust your work surface with
cornstarch and put some cornstarch on
your fingertips to keep them from
sticking to the chocolate use your
fingertips to flatten the ball prior to
Rolling it out on the work
surface place the chocolate on the work
surface and dust it with some corn
starch to keep it from sticking to the
rolling pin roll once and then you're
going to turn the chocolate at 90° to
loosen it you can use your spatula roll
again and then turn 90° this helps to
keep the chocolate evenly
rolled roll the chocolate to about 116th
inch now we're going to cut the two
wings with the leaf cutter notice that I
smooth the edges of the wing before I
loosen the wing from the cutter and this
helps to give nice smooth
edges we're going to move on now to
attach These Wings to the
swan first you need to orient the wings
to the swan you'll notice there's a long
side and a short side the long side goes
on the bottom of the body the short side
goes toward the top you're going to
texturize the long side angled toward
the tip of the wing go all the way down
the wing all the way to the
tip the wing can now attached to the
swan's body with some light pressure
just press it onto the swan's body make
sure that the feathers are pointing down
you're going to curve the wing outward
and you'll do the same thing with the
second wing and point that one outward
as
well so take a look at your Swan make
sure that the shape is the way that you
want it to be take a look at it from all
directions and admire your work what a
good
job
these beautiful and graceful decorations
