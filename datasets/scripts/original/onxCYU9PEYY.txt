welcome youtube world this is on a
how-to on how to get all the suds out of
your um
dishwasher
now we're going to open it up take a
look at it
there's none in there so we need to
create a situation that has a lot of
suds
use palm olive
add a little water to make a little more
liquidy
a little bit left in this old bottle so
we'll use that throw some of it in there
wash this
spin it back on
and what happens is people use the wrong
soap or use too much soap or don't use
those model tablets or put a
washing machine model tablet in there
and it causes them all kinds of problems
see
a bunch of suds we'll let it go a little
more
build the suds up now suds
start knocking all the water out of it
and so
you start pouring water out the front
and so it starts taking over the whole
thing it's an easy way to cure
simple simple
i'll show you
what i use is vegetable
just a little bit of it just get
whatever the cheapest vegetables you
find whatever you have laying around the
house
okay now look at all those subs this
picture start pouring out the front all
you got to do is put you about two cups
in there and there you go
what that does is that gives the soap
something to attach to they'll attach to
that oil
and um
once they do that
then um
it'll go ahead and it'll neutralize
everything
you can call repair guy out and do it
for you
it's always good dude look at that
right at the top
all right let's take a look
oh wow
that's more
pop that bin off see how much was in
there
hardly anything
so now what we're going to do we just
add some more light cycle for a minute
you want to drain it out so
you got a good amount in there
try to get some of that soap that that
oil attached to your leaf suds in there
so it's going to be remaining in there
that's fine
because it's a process you might do this
once or twice
because we
we put a lot of palm olive in there
but even as severe as this situation is
it's not that bad
all right we're going to add some more
water into it and once we get the more
water into it then we're going to add
some more oil
keep repeating that process over and
over might take you three or four times
all right looks better this time i could
see more of the bottom so we're gonna
let it fill again
all right it just got done feeling the
third time so let's add some more oil
as you can see how much more liquidy it
is
all right
it's about to start drying out
and we'll add the last one in there and
as you can tell there's almost no suds
so the fourth field we'll go ahead clear
everything else and then we'll drain it
and we'll be done
so let's go ahead let it drain and we'll
fill it back up one more time and as you
can see this is the end of the third
it's been running probably about
one to two minutes it doesn't take very
long for the oil mix around there with
the soap and it bind together
so we haven't drained it again but we
added another cup of oil
now it's circulating again
now it's not coming out the front no
more so it's doing better so we're going
to drain it again
and try our for treatment
we'll just keep repeating that until
it's done
let it fill up add some let it go for a
little bit draining it out
all right it just drained out as you can
see
looks pretty clean there's still some
suds down in it all right as you can see
on the fourth field
looks pretty good in there
very little subs it'll work the rust out
just go ahead let it finish out the
cycle and you'll be done
