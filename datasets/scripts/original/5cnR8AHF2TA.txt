HOW TO GET GLUE OUT OF CARPET
One of the most critical things you can do
when trying to remove glue from carpet is
act quickly.
As soon as you discover the glue stain, be
sure to take action, as many kinds of glues
are especially quick-drying.
Take a sharp knife and carefully scrape any
glue residue off of the affected area on the
carpet.
If the glue has hardened, you may need to
scrape for a longer period to loosen the substance
from the carpet fibers.
After you have scraped as much of the glue
away as possible, cover the glue stain with
a thin cloth.
Using a household iron, begin to heat up the
glue by running a hot iron over the cloth,
which is sitting on top of the glue stain.
The glue should soften, which will then be
absorbed into the thin cloth.
NO VO: Didn't work...
As a last resort, grab a pair of household
scissors.
Slowly and carefully cut the affected area
of the carpet to remove the glue residue.
This method only works on thick carpets with
long fibers.
