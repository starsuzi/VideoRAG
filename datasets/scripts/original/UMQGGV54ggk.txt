all
right so this is my crystal rock it's
all
crystal but it's so dirty that I can't
really
uh appreciate the crystals on it so I'm
going to
try putting this on
there just brush it
on with this
brush and just like dip it down and
brush it dip it down and brush it and
um I've never tried this before so we'll
see what happens
here got my
acid and I'm going to go ahead and pour
some on
there hope it doesn't blow up or
anything now I've seen this done before
except these guys were soaking
it and a mixture of the stuff so what
I'll do is I'll just scrape it
down just to get it worked in there it's
probably going to ruin this
brush and it looks like it's getting a
little oh yeah I think it's clearing up
a
little cleaning it up
just and brush
it it's almost look soaking it
in I'm just going to do this on one side
to see if it works and then if it does
work I'll go ahead and do the whole
thing make sure I'm still on camera and
just keep pouring it on
here little bit at a
time try not to bring the
fumes it's just myotic acid or I can't
even say it right
martic whatever acid pool acid
let see how this comes
out so I'm going to continue doing
this and then when I'm done I'll show it
again on camera we'll see how it comes
out um I think I have to do it a lot
actually so we'll see what
happens all right I finished doing that
and uh what I did is I turned it upside
down on the side I was
doing
and I left the acid in there but I also
added water and I'm going to let it sit
overnight and then I'll finish it I'll
do it again tomorrow it definitely looks
lighter color so hopefully it'll come
out
good hopefully I after I thought about
it though I could have tried it on this
smaller piece I wasn't
thinking oh well learn from your
mistakes all right I finished uh doing
the acid wash and it came out much
cryster it's much cleaner that's for
sure um I mean it looks like it's wet
and it's not it's like it's really
awesome
um I can see different colors of
crystals in there
but there's still some other junk in
there like right in here like a rock but
just on the edges which is really
cool um I hope this comes out on
video but it worked it's much cleaner
um now if I could just figure out how to
make it into a ball I can make a crystal
ball and then shine it
[Music]
up
anyways my brother's ringing the bell
that means I got to go
but anyways yeah I'm pretty happy with
it came out pretty
good um yeah
so I might even break it up and make
smaller chunks out of it I don't know I
want to make a crystal ball though
anyways that's it for this one
