hi my name is Carolyn and this is a
little video I made when I made my
outdoor
fireplace the summer before we put on
the pool we decided to extend the Pao
area and then decided to put an outdoor
fireplace in just to block the window
and the bit of
privacy this is a shot what it used to
be look like
before the concrete went down boxed it
all
up and this was just an idea that I had
um initially for the
fireplace just experimenting with
different colors didn't end up going
with that
color dug them down about 15 to 20
cm put in the rebar drilled a wider hole
and put some um CH chemical compound to
hold the rebar
in this was my most difficult one cuz i'
never laid a brick
before and then that was a bit
better the second
here and then I laid across some what
they call incl in New Zealand which is
like uh irrated concrete once I after I
finished
this there it is there and it's yeah
irated concrete good good fire proofing
and very light and easy to work with I
rebaited the little fire
Edge and it just screwed in
second
tier oh that was just me falling around
on publisher what I was hoping it would
look like and then that's the sort of
just built another little thing up there
got ready I've got a steel canopy made
that thing there that you can see now
and um that was cost me $250 got that
made which had a little bit of a flu
angle so I knew that the smoke and that
would go up and it
worked tier three that was
just
visualizations there's the children in
there and that's it kind of
finished the chimney is just one big
cavity that was a um they're quite thin
bricks just around the
outside so this was the little plan that
I had done so I wanted a little wall in
there I was going to put some seats and
things like that on there so I start off
by building the
pillars there are making them nice and
level those footings are really deep
massive probably Overkill loads of Steel
in
them making sure it's all
level I'm not the best concreter but
anyway cuz I knew I was Plastering over
the top of them it didn't make any
difference it's one finished I was going
to put caps on them but um in the end
when I looked at it actually didn't
really need
it loads of Steel they're full of
concrete and four pieces of Steel in
each pillar so they're pretty pretty
sty there they go
and then I started building the
wall yeah those are bits of duct tape on
the bottom there cuz I just placed the
bricks and then I filled it with runny
concrete it was a very primitive way it
was not the best way of doing it but it
ended up working okay cuz I knew there
was enough steel and concrete in the in
the Bild to make it strong and then that
one there's the a bond beam which has
got an empty cavity and the rebar goes
across I think I put a picture of it in
this is very strong but pretty ugly
really though I did
it held together
with okay that was quite difficult
trying to intersect the wall with the um
fireplace it was just a bit fiddly
came along quite nicely and again that
was the same sort of issue having to cut
lots of bricks and things like that to
get it to
intersect okay so the construction was
complete oh there we go just ready for
the Plastering coat I
think it's the concrete and the front
has got um macro Cara sleepers in them
so I just did that by hand had concrete
macro Cara along there along the front
of the fireplace you can
see look really
effective okay this is the slush or
slurry
coat and as you can read there just you
flick it on so it's a really rough
surface so they um plus there's
something to adhere
to pretty messy job I read it on YouTube
so um and it it worked it worked it
really
did so it sort of dried like a stippled
1980s concrete house so I lined that
with fireproof
bricks and then I um
used a cement render with some
plasticizer inside of it so it was a bit
more pliable and easy to work with and
it didn't go off so
quickly so it's pretty smooth
there and then I sealed it before I
painted it that was that was a fun job I
enjoyed
that so it locked it
in because it's got a thin layer of con
plaster like the um the the final coat
it it there were slight cracks but at
the end of the day it wasn't a a big
thing so I would you know if we had a
big raging fire in it I would um they
were just surface cracks not not
structural and then I um I used to if if
we had a big bit of a party I would just
put mix up a bit of a slurry and flick
it in and paint it over again and it was
it always worked
it's just the perfectionist in me I
could have just left
it that's it from
behind and
yeah that's kind of how it looks look we
got a bit of a garden in there
now yeah and then we end up and sold the
house and I'm going to rebuild the whole
thing again so we've moved to a bigger
section and we're building another house
and I'm going to do a bigger one with a
with a bigger
pull that's the plan anyway there you go
thanks for
watching finished and we yes I had to do
some Landscaping after that and I did on
the other side um I built on the back of
the fireplace I bought a nice um garden
with some sort of grasses and things
like that oh there you
go it's been a while since I've seen
this video
and River Rock and I did that on the
other side I don't think I've got photos
of
that and now I'm planning my next bre oh
my pillars at the front you stood
them
entrance yeah so I whipped out those
trees and put in some entrance
pillar and it looks almost identical to
that I wonder if I put a photo
on of the final one no okay there you go
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed it
um goes to show you that uh anyone can
do anything I'd never laid a brick in my
life and uh did it all from Google and
YouTube and DIY forums enjoy you can do
it
