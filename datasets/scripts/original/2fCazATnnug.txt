Lets go ahead and make this tasty recipe.
To start with, we will use following Ingredients:
Slices of bread dipped in milk for 20-25 minutes
1 Cup of full fat cream
1 Cup of condensed milk.. which I actually made it at home
You can find the link to my recipe of "condensed milk" in the description box
Sliced small pieces of cashews, nuts & almonds
To start with - first we will add the prepared mixture of bread and milk to the blender.
Its done..
Add cream & condensed milk to the blender ..
I am adding little bit of blended bread/milk mixture to the blender to ease out the blending process.
Transfer it to the big bowl and mix it well with already prepared bread/milk blended mixture.
condensed milk is already very sweet so I didn't add any sugar.
If you feel like adding more sugar .. you can add it as per your taste.
just keep in mind one thing.. if you want to add more sugar then add sugar to the milk before mixing it here.
Sprinkle the sliced dry fruits ( Cashews, nuts or almonds)
Mix it well
Take a tray / container
Sprinkle sliced dry fruits on the tray / container
Now Add the bread kulfi mixture we prepared.
Sprinkle some more sliced cashews, nuts & Almonds on the top.
Its almost ready and I will keep it in the freezer for 5-7 hours.
Here we go!!! - I just pulled it out from the freezer after 7 hours and its ready to serve.
