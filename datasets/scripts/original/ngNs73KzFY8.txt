Hi guys, hope you're well.
So let me give you an amazing breakfast
That is delicious, nutritious and you're gonna
love
We are going to make beautiful chocolate bircher
Get an apple, a big ol'bowl, a box
grater and have a little grate up
And you can grate the whole thing.
Don't take the skin off, that's where a lot
of the pectin is at
And then I'm gonna use a pear as well
I'm gonna take an orange, slice it up straight
over your apple and pears
And that's not only gonna add amazing flavour
but the vitamin C and the acid in that are
gonna stop
any of this discolouring.
Then, of course,
the classic; porridge oats go on top
And that energy is gonna slow burn until
lunchtime
So two hefty tablespoons of cocoa goes into
the liquidiser
I'm gonna go in with a banana.
Alright again really really good for you!
Fantastic for potassium, it's sweet, it's
delicious
600mls of milk, waz this up
So look basically what we've made is a smoothie.
And that bitterness
from the cocoa has now been balanced with
natural sugar from the banana
And of course, with the porridge oats that
energy slowly released
and I've got one last little
ingredient to add; the Medjool dates
But actually, if we chop these up, right,
they release their sugar slower and also
they're really chewy and delicious and a
nice little surprise when you eat it
So I'll stir that in and this will be
ready in like five hours.
It will just suck up all the moisture
That will happily sit in the fridge for a
couple of days
Easy-peasy!
If it lasts that long so just wrap it up
with cling film, squeeze the air out, give
it a seal.
There's no need to do that at
all but it just feels good
So let's get that in the fridge.
Tomorrow this will be amazing
So this has been soaking overnight and this
will be good for a couple of days in the fridge
but it won't last that long
You can see that it's thickened up so a nice
little spoon like that is beautiful, a little
handful
of hazelnuts.
Of course you could use any
nut you like but I really love hazelnuts
and chocolate - you know why.
I've the seeds, let's just get those sprinkled
in just mix seeds and just bash it up
So I really love to add some nuts and seeds
and again this just makes it even more healthy
Whatever fruit is in season, just
fill your boots and have a go
We've got the apple and pear in there already,
but of course whether the frozen or fresh
these berries are really, really fun to
have with a bircher.
And then if you want
you can add a little bit of Greek yoghurt
and this is beautiful, let's have a
little try
It is so good!
So really nice
start to the day, it feels really indulgent
but of course this bowl is full of
goodness!
So what you're waiting for?
Get those oats, get whizzing and get
making your bircher
Take care
