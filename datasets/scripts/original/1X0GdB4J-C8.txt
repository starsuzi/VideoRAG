I'm just going to show you how to take
it out of the spring form Pan um we're
just going to cut along the sides with
our um flat Edge you could use a just a
regular kitchen knife um like a a butter
knife or if you have a longer utensil
like this that will help
you um since this one is not set fully
it will be a little stickier than it
will be after
an hour or two in the
fridge so we'll just keep this
clean have
S then this will be the test test we pop
the sides just give a little shake and
and that will pop off like
that and this is the part that sometimes
is a little bit a little bit
intimidating for people and um once
you've done it sometimes it gets easier
um but you just slide your knife
underneath
and once you know that you've loosened
the
crust you can slide it
off go if you want you could use wet
hands and Patch it up a slight
bit
um but
otherwise
voila
