so I just finished ruining this $100
countertop and uh I used the clamp on
2x4 straight edge run your circular saw
down the other side and uh somehow it
left the fence and cut a crooked so I'm
looking to see if there was a better way
and I found a jig so I'm going to build
that jig and then at the same same time
um I haven't noticed anybody mentioned
if you plan on putting the endc caps on
you have to actually extend the
measurement out 38 of an inch to have
room to mount um some MDF to the
underside to support that endcap all
right so this jig is going to be made
out of 3/4 in plywood this is a
1x3 and uh how you set it up
is you layer
down and then I'm going to measure this
this distance and I'm going to add that
over here as well and I'm actually going
to make it a little bit bigger that way
when I screw this down I can run the saw
and take off any extra just to make sure
that everything's nice and straight and
uh and then I will put the end cap on
the
end so for my saw it's 4 and 1/2 in and
then you've got a 1x3 which is actually
2 and and 1/2
in so I'm going to take 4 1/2 plus 4 and
1/2 that gives you 9 plus the 2 and 1/2
11 and or 12 and I'm going to cut it to
about 12 and 1/2 to give me a/4 of an
inch to cut off on both sides
so I cut this piece which is going to
actually go down the
middle um to the exact where this Edge
is and now I'm going to transfer that
measurement to here and cut this one as
well and then all I'll have left is the
plate that's going to go
here another piece of plywood that's
going to butt up against the end so we
drew a line on the center of both
brought it to the
edge
um throw some glue on
here it's not really important that this
is precise because I'm going to rip
these edges off
anyway I guess I'm wasting more time on
this than I need to
[Music]
play with me
a
crap now that the glue is
dried we need to put this end piece on
and we need to make it matte
and uh if I would have thought this out
a little better I would have cut this
piece to come all the way out to
here but I
didn't
bummer awesome that's exactly what I
wanted so because I got to recut this
one anyway I got to I'm going to I
brought it all the way up and then I
just cut this little filler and I'll
just glue it all in I mean I doubt
there's going to be any pressure on that
anyway so
yeah it's a bit much
huh guess we'll find out when we cut our
first ruin another piece of laminate
counter
top all right now that it's clamped down
we just need to follow our guide and cut
it off
after we plug it
in right so this is The Edge I messed up
so because I'm going to cut a new
hopefully straight edge this time we'll
go through the standard
process since I'm only going to be
cutting off a little
bit supposedly this is to help with the
tear
out and I put uh towels down so that
when I flip it over like this scratch it
all
up hang it
off all right so here's the
idea they call this a
fullprof um countertop jig cutting jig
but I'll be the judge of
that we just need to clamp it down and
we should be able to square this
off all right so here goes nothing
he
H actually looks pretty
straight and then after attaching that
bottom piece I was talking about help
support
this WOW actually uh that might be right
it might be a foolproof jig for cutting
countertops just come back with a trim
router or a file and it's good to go
