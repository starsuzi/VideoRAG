- Hi I'm Jerry James Stone
and in today's video
I'm going to talk to you
about cooking the perfect barley.
I love barley.
It's a great, great grain.
It's wonderful in soups.
It's wonderful with
like roasted vegetables.
It's tasty but it's
also can be kinda tricky
and kinda you know, easy
to fuck up a little bit.
I'm gonna be honest.
So here's how you cook the perfect barley.
Let me get to showing you.
(light energetic music)
So the first thing to
making the perfect barley is
that you have to rinse it.
You want to get all the debris
and grit that could possibly be in there.
I would typically do this over the sink
but I just want to show you,
you know, show you the action.
It's easier to do in a bowl of water.
Just rinse it, rinse it clean.
It just takes a few seconds
and you can add it perfectly
wet to the next step.
Okay, so the first thing
for our perfect barley is some salt.
You wanna salt the water.
And then we're gonna add in our barley.
Now we're just cooking it just like pasta.
The reason here is that
by cooking it like pasta
it actually cooks quicker and
it always comes out perfect.
This is a hulled barley
so it's not pearl barley
so this takes a little bit longer to cook
because it has the bran around it.
Where pearl barley actually
has that bran removed.
So we're gonna shave off about
10, 15 minutes of cook time
just by cooking it like pasta.
So just bring that back to a boil.
(whooshing)
Okay here's our perfectly cooked barley.
How great does that look?
Super easy using this pasta method.
Comes out perfect every single time.
So that's it,
that's all it takes to cook
the perfect barley, right?
You just cook it just like pasta.
Now typically barley takes
about 40 minutes to cook.
But in this method
you'll shave off a good
15, 10 minutes or so,
which makes it cook a lot faster.
And that means more
delicious barley for you.
I used a hull less barley in this video
but you can also cook a pearl barley
which cooks a lot faster,
it's the whiter grain.
Check that out if you want.
Anyway, if you like this
video, give me a thumbs up.
