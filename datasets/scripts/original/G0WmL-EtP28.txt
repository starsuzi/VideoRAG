hello everyone this is Reggie the washer
dryer repair in there come to you from
my home shop we're kinda garage and
we're repairing a whirlpool top loader
washer and this is when I hang out by
understudies machines that is when I
picked up and the lady said won't start
but let's see I put them on Spanish
plugged in so if you're not spinning
here to humming that means that motor is
locked up and typically that means the
motor is your pump there so you'll have
two clips this clip and there's one
above it and you just pull those off you
can't see it's dark in there but TV use
pull those off with your fingers too but
uh I like quick and easy so
you push that clamp off so if you're
dressed from inside your house you don't
wear everywhere you can always turn it
back on spin doing this at home you're
going to get a bucket you always clean
up the hose together like hell wear
these
just pinch it closed
[Music]
I'm doing so now I'm removing those two
clamps no the pump messed your pump so
you move those two clamps
[Music]
[Music]
oh yeah look we have here typically the
culprit of that is baby sucks but I
don't know what the suck that is you can
see it's a little darker there do that
so what you want to do is do some needle
nose pliers take that off again
he's amateur camera work okay so spit
your needle nose in there usually on the
bigger end pull that out and usually I
use the side of this was leverage yank
it out you just twist it once you get a
grip on it this twist twist and you'll
get that
so yeah some prepare me to come out and
charge it for a homing pump and you do
these pumps are see if you don't see any
water dripping down here that means your
pump is good but if you see water marks
there that means sometimes these
obstructions can cause it to see little
break in the pump the leak you can just
remove these things put the pump back on
and you're back in business so that's
the suck now their customer house this
would be a $150 pair W $150 side so now
you put this back on
and we're gonna run it the first thing
we do if you look the special shape on
it
