To prepare your acorn squash for cooking first
you're going to take you knife and we're going
to pierce the squash and bring it all the
way down. A note of caution when working with
acorn squash is it can roll around very easily
and that is very dangerous whenever you are
working with your knife so be extra careful.
I'm going to take my knife and pierce it through
the center of the squash. Once I get down
to end of the cutting board I'm going to work
my knife down to the edge of the squash. I'm
going to flip it over and do the same thing
to the other side. I'm going to find my initial
pierce and I'm going to go through that hole
and come all the way down again. Now I've
got half of the squash cut open. Now I'm going
to go down and I'm just going to pierce through
and I'm going to try and get the rest of the
squash cut up.
Now I've got my squash cut up. Now I'm going
to remove the seeds with a spoon. That is
how you prepare acorn squash for cooking.
