hello everyone welcome to a new video
today i will teach how to make a
transforming ninja star
this origami is relatively simple is
composed of four pieces each one is made
with one square of paper
you can use any type but the four have
to be the same size
i recommend using 10 by 10 centimeters
but for easy viewing in this video i'll
use 15 by 15.
i also recommend two different colors
for a better result
well to make the first piece
take the first square
and fold in half on the vertical
[Music]
unfold
and now fold each half of the top to the
middle line
first the right side
[Music]
then the left
[Music]
now rotate the paper
and fold this diagonal edge on the left
side
to the middle
just on the center
here we need to pay attention on the
bottom side
we must to leave as much alignment as
possible
like this
[Music]
okay
undo
and now do exactly the same thing on the
other side
[Music]
[Music]
now turn it over
close this corner on the right side and
reverse the rest of the paper
pushing down like this
[Music]
arrange a little if necessary
[Music]
and reinforce
okay
now let's fold up this corner on the
bottom
fold the maximum
until here
and unfold
again we need to reverse this corner
so using the same crease
bring up
reinforce a little bit again
[Music]
and the first piece is ready
we need to make more tree
[Music]
and with this done let's fit
take two pieces and here pay attention
again
we need to fit in
this position on this point
the second piece inside the first
and leaving very precise and aligned
fold this little flap inside the second
piece
[Music]
just like that
over the first layer
[Music]
now turn it over
and repeat the same on the other side
right the first two okay
now for the third one
keep these two in this position
and fit the third like the opposite of
the first piece
[Music]
again
very precise
arrange a little if necessary
[Music]
then fold the little flaps
[Music]
and for the last one
we first need to open the third
that way
and now fit the last one just as before
[Music]
finally fold the flaps of both pieces
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and our paper ninja star is ready
just pull to open like this
[Music]
and to close it just be careful to not
need these little flaps here
go is slowly closing
and it returns to the original shape
well that's it
