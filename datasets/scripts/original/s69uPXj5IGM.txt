- Hey, are your shower doors
full of hard water spots
that you just can't seem to get rid of?
I've got a perfect solution to take care
of all of those problems
with any hard water stains
in your bathroom.
I'm your Fuller Brush Man.
You need to check this one out.
You ever wonder why you
get all that spotting
all over your shower
doors and shower walls?
Most of the time it's because
of the minerals in the water.
When water beads dry, they
turn into water spots.
This is one of my
favorite cleaning products
because let's face it,
everybody hates cleaning the bathroom,
but this product makes it much easier.
It's called Bath Clean.
It's got an ingredient
in it called Grime Guard,
and if you've ever cooked
with nonstick cookware,
you know how everything just
slides right out of the pan?
Grime Guard puts an invisible
barrier of protection
on whatever surface you spray it on,
making your bathroom a nonstick bathroom.
You'll end up cleaning less often.
Now when you're using Bath
Clean, it's very simple to use,
and this is real soap scum
on this tile board here.
You've got mold and mildew that builds up
in your grout lines, but
watch how easy this works,
and I like to hold this up to show you
what you're gonna love about Bath Clean.
When you spray it on the
surface you want to clean,
it clings.
It comes out in a foaming spray.
That foam will cling to your shower wall.
It doesn't just run down the drain.
The longer it clings, the
better it's gonna clean,
and I like to show you that
because when you're spraying
Bath Clean on your shower
doors and shower walls,
it does a fantastic job because
it can cling to the walls,
but it cuts right through that hard water,
soap scum, limescale, any rust.
Mildew and mold is no
match for the Grime Guard
in the Bath Clean.
But take a look at this.
I'm just using my fingers
to clean the tile,
but you can imagine with the several tools
that Fuller Brush makes.
In fact, here's one of my favorites.
It's an E-Z Scrubber for the bathroom.
It comes with this scrub pad,
and when you spray Bath
Clean on your shower walls
or shower doors, you'll use this,
because of this special pad,
you can see the thickness,
and it's a little bit rough,
so it's got that scrubbing
ability, to clean your tiles,
and when you press down on it,
it even gets down into those grout lines
to get rid of the mold,
the mildew, the hard water,
lime and calcium buildup.
And then, what I love about it,
it's got a builtin squeegee,
so all you do is squeegee your walls clean
and it comes out perfect
each and every time.
I mean, look at that.
That's like a mirrored finish,
with no mold, no mildew.
And remember, with Bath
Clean, it leaves that
invisible barrier of protection
on whatever surface you spray it on,
so you'll end up cleaning
your showers less often.
Hopefully your shower
doors don't look this bad,
but if they do, I mean
with hard water spots,
lime and calcium
deposits, using Bath Clean
is the perfect solution for taking care
of all of those hard water problems.
Again, it's a foaming
spray, so when you spray it
on your shower doors or shower walls,
it stays where you spray it.
The longer it clings to the surface,
the better it's gonna
clean, and take a look.
It cuts right through hard water,
calcium, lime deposits,
rust, all of the soap scum
that builds up on our
shower doors over time.
It leaves it spot-free, streak-free.
In fact, take a look at this.
You'll be able to see through
your shower doors once again.
I mean, look at the
before and after there.
You can even read the instructions
on the back of the bottle
through your shower door.
You're gonna love it on
all of the glass surfaces
in your bathroom,
fiberglass, ceramic tile,
every surface in the bathroom.
Bath Clean is the perfect solution
for all of your hard water problems.
