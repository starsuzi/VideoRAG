hi this is ingred from eat well enjoy
life and today we're going to cook
delicious dandelion greens we're going
to make them sauteed in garlic which is
very simple recipe Now in America we
tend to think of dandelions as a weed
that we want to get rid of in our garden
but in Italy and France they love
dandelions and you can find them on most
menus all over those countries and the
reason that dandelions are fabulous is
because they're high in vitamin A they
have more iron than spinach they have
more vitamin C than uh carrots and they
also are very good for your kidneys
because they act as a diuretic cleansing
your system of toxins okay let's get
started first we take the dandelion
greens and we trim off the
ends and we want them to be clean so we
rinse them in a bowl of
water
and just drain them a little
bit and what we're going to do is we're
going to blanch them to take away some
of the bitterness and the
toughness now if they're small and
tender they need less blanching but
these are pretty good size so we're
going to blanch them um you know about 5
to 10 minutes cutting them into 1 in
pieces
so that they are tender and easy to
eat and that's it we just throw them in
the water
there and let them boil about 5 to 10
minutes depending on the size until they
are um um pretty tender that's what you
want you want them to be tender so now
that these are um tender we're going to
pour them into a
colander and we want to squeeze out the
water before we sauté them so we're
going to let them cool for a little bit
um if you're in a hurry you can always
rinse them under cold water like
this
and squeeze
out don't burn your yourself squeeze out
the excess
moisture because if they're wet and you
sauté them you're not going to to um get
as much
flavor so we'll let that sit and drain
for a
minute now we're going to heat up some
um extra virgin olive oil couple of
tablespoons we always want to heat it on
medium low because we don't want the
olive oil to get too hot it oxidizes
when it's too hot put in
uh a couple of cloves of garlic that
have been chopped up
coarsely a little bit of
salt a little bit of red pepper
flakes and this is our dandelion that
has um been squeezed out most of the
water and the garlic needs about 45
seconds just to uh warm up a little bit
and get
fragrant and put
in the
dandelion now these are pretty much
cooked you really just sautéing them to
get the flavor and to co them with the
oil the oil um will offset the
bitterness of the green so you get this
really nice um sweet and bitter
combination flavor with the uh olive oil
and the garlic mixed in with the dandel
lime green
so we're just going to let that simmer
sauté here about I've sauteed for about
5 minutes and they look done to me I'm
just going to taste one see if it's
tender yes very
good maybe a tiny bit more
salt and then we're going to finish it
with a little bit of olive oil now this
is optional um this adds a little bit
more sweet flavor to it and the olive
oil hasn't been cooked so it really is
um like a finishing uh taste for it so
here's our um spring dandelion
greens
