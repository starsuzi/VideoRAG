who's this Phyllis vomity commercial
so get some peace pilgrim
you know bath patron has been scrapped
it with its many people in the house
just get some newspapers and making it
off Matt if you're dog enough it's
fourteen inches your 1/2 avocado seven
inches an inch so that you have a fabric
over 8 inches just run an apple I'm up
here 1 2 then 5 and the general rule is
you want to do like inch and 1/2 more on
the bottom and that give you that angle
so if it's done in inches up here and
the images appear do I did like s100 - 6
inches 7 inches here so I went all the
way 8 and 1/2 down here
and end up like this so the Japan brick
what's the best if you can do it all for
you can for the product or like this so
you have one continuous piece we unfold
it around I don't have enough that what
to do that you can major like an extra
half an inch on your pattern and
you won't be right next to a very
convenient
you know for the guns do all the dogs
we're going to be using a patient -
hoping you
the stiff stuff just because John
basically if you are using pointers or
repelling path not know about you are
absolutely
you just have to be perfect moment
and take this piece here I cut out my
whole piece right
Oh
watch watch watch watch
but make sure you keep in mind your
shyness
come on
seriously
now lookie here
if you use interfacing this step do one
strip of a class goes to a circular on
your dog's neck looks very awkward and
uncomfortable
the big dogs two men are facing that's
really over the air like this
if we make our lives miserable by the
crappy on them enough to learn wherever
unfortunately dog
what
if you get them off by himself you know
to drop out of the cube is just not
there everywhere just holla but I got I
understand
English
now it was next up but until you are
threatening little care you're just
going to make a little bit a mark there
fold-over only about border reach and
only do the right about here you're not
blue much and work with
and we've gotta keep in mind news and
hot foods that we can function one area
and have the veterinarian
take range another strip
like I'm 21
so because we won't do this notes on the
balls map uh literally this edge right
here for your dolphin where you can see
that they're popping up it doesn't look
very good
also I've been on wears for a while but
it's good like this but that is straight
up brave looking and if you're going
through this much trouble to make this
again might as well take the extra step
and do it right analyze you can write as
you can't believe in
I has great people of himself but my
mother and grandmother
so harmonica so so very well wearing
this beautiful
but over the years of watching her show
on I'm watching frustrated she would get
when after she fell at time effort into
doing some things didn't turn out
evacuation elated to I wanted a third
for that just mess up like that and I
thought yeah not bad i rated just put
one gotten a chair
take the shoes
but pull it I will see how much luggage
Oh
down bottom you don't need to do the
double on bond didn't see it and don't
skip out
do the middle number however the Hyatt
you get this part the lesser happen up
so make sure you go to the straight line
there
anytime
miss away
so take this or you can fold it so that
the ruffle is facing more point
you're sure power point there
nobody's talking right
who is injured
doing edges down this edge will try to
pop it rocks
without your hand
I'm sensing of the funds
request me
we're on fire
nothing
personal space
no you don't need to go to really muster
extra edges - we need to we I can tell I
like this room top there's a little
bubbly officer that going down or where
they might be there's a basic shirt
collar right there okay now not having
this piece of interfacing right here - a
lot of sides pull over so now I'm going
to show you how to put a tie like that
we're going to be a lot better all
because you actually watch this video
but I
idea works this is slightly different
but I'm just I would just do it sure
I don't know the comprehend I'll finish
it well mr. boss that point is why
and if you make securities you'll
eventually like
besides you want using a little piece
facing servicios fast
not to get a little weight
so
interfacing
the shirt colors too easily easily made
the center of your home put my uncle I
was going for that way I get a lot even
with these buttons you can simply just
take it a bit over like this and the
button right there
like sometimes I take and real time but
Nana
so
so let them have my back 11 lines fold
it in half this way the important part
to make sure the top part
you can earn half with the rough side
out
not just cut an angle
and
all right now this is where the
different um
you know just for time
is it
no place to prepare
slightly the whippersnapper done okay
it's not important if you're not careful
if you're i if you stop on this side you
need stuff on the side it's really easy
enough point up and it all kinda
lopsided always start at your point
though because if you start in the sides
move besides taking over for it we don't
even go through ours
so always start with
these ones don't have to perfect on a
coin
the adjustable vampires because you know
things like adjustable wonderful it is a
supply so you can
push the glue it out we're not here
myself
chicken CFA
protect me on the points
you put the burger
that puts away over the backside so one
right here my way over here
and this will happen to you if it
doesn't happen to you
everyone stop
go through that you also
the
take these pieces a piece whether or not
this one is just not important
actually series of goodness
that factory will
toggling or so
- coffee
almost
you have to be
adjustable so
this case
very nice about my husband
Jesus wish my not this is really yeah
but my daughter
yeah so hard time doing it
you're not really there's blue slips
after their own put the edges down
again
so
you're gonna do
I use velcro round there already
freedom
long strips over I like these however we
have the selfish we can do stock which
they can
no Louise down your dog is gonna have us
and we'll lift off this mag in about two
seconds flat
you're not first
so take your time
really with us whichever side will be
fast
I like user interface inside but there's
like this better show
this
remember
top this was the tie this ham right here
would be covered up flat attack so I'm
going to write down the fabric bunched
up in there
and
there
and I like this name if you have which
overhang booth there's my god you again
stick them together
do there
so why
okay so while that's you
then
it's growing
when people knowing
you find it
soon
extra
College them
what
just
you like crazy eyes yeah
today retreat along pushing
occasionally certain purpose
together
let it dry
this year
especially
Pilon
sometimes a defense does and step there
thank you
that's right
Oh
