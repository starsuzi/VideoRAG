all right so this is a video on how to
use the high lift Jack
to pull out tree stumps these are white
pines
as you can see
they're about 20 30 feet tall but I've
been pulling out a couple
it's my neighbor Nick over here
so basic setup is we have the high lift
mounted to a board
mounted to two by threes as a tripod to
give it support because it's going to
want to pull forward
and with a chain so Nick you want to do
the honors
show you how it's done
okay
just shoot that big root like butter
so make what they take about a minute
yes
all right there you go
it's a simple design that's it
all right lots of
