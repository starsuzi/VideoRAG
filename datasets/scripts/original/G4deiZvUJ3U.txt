all right this video is going to show
how to do MLA format for your Works
sited page um I know it's something that
a lot of my peers struggle with and I
struggle with too sometimes because I
can never remember you know if the title
goes first the author goes wherever the
publisher date so I'm going to show how
to set up the page for that and then I'm
going to show how to format specific
sources uh for probably the three most
commonly used ones so after you've got a
lot of your essay here you
probably put in uh something from a
source you know some information you
need to site it and you need to put it
on the works sited page so to create
your Works sited page you go to the last
page of your document go to the end of
the last paragraph and hit controll
enter and that's going to just bring up
a new page there what you want to do
with that first line of
text is hit this Center icon on here you
need to center it and write works
cited then hit
enter and left align the text after that
so now we're down to where we're going
to enter in our
sources to do this properly we need to
go up here to this tool for adjusting
the tabs and the indents if you go to
the top one it'll say first line indent
you don't want that one you want to go
to the
kind of the middle button there says
hanging in that just drag that over half
an
inch and what that's going to do is set
up your sources in proper
format
so now I guess
uh I'll go over some of the most common
ones I guess most of us are probably
going to be writing our essays at 3:00
a.m. you know the day it's due um so I'm
assuming the most common source is going
to be a web page or an article from a
database uh a lot of us aren't going to
be running out to the library at 3:00
a.m. so for a web page what you want to
do is enter the author if you know who
the author is and it would go last name
first name this going to be the the
format for pretty much any source and
then in quotations you put the title of
the web page page this is for one
specific page on a website so let's say
this one
is I'll just do
this make it
simple then you close the
quotations and then in
italics you can hit control I to get the
italics or you can come up here and just
click it you type the uh title of the
website
so that's for the whole website
and you hit period space and you don't
want to be italic anymore and here
you're going to put the publisher date
or the
company sorry the publisher name or the
company that's affiliated with the
website that's that's publishing it
online and then you want to do a comma
instead of a period this time and you do
the
date um usually just a year something
like that or if there's no date you can
do ND same for no publisher say there
was no publisher I could do n p that's
no
publisher next you need to type the form
which would be web we're accessing it
online it's going to be web and then you
type the date that you accessed it so
I'm making this on February 8th I think
so it's like that and see what it did
there is it it did a hanging
indent so that there's for a uh a web
page you can see it went back out to a
left Al line first line of the next
paragraph next paragraph is going to be
your next
source so now we're going to do an
article from a database it's very
similar most of these are very similar
um honestly if you get it close most
professors are not going to care uh
but some do so this just better to be uh
safe and sorry so same for this you're
going to go last name of the author
first now for both of these um for any
Source if you don't know the name you
just don't put it you go straight to the
title or straight to you know the the
website so here you would do the title
of the article
followed by a period and then you close
the quotations in
italics you
do the name of the
journal or
periodical and then get rid of your
italics again control I or just click
I and then you type the version
number so that would say you know
version or issue so it could be issue 10
version one whatever you can do 10.1 in
that
case um and then in
quotations you do the date usually
that's just the year and then do a
colon and you say what pages you used so
let's say you
use
page say three
through
six you do it like
that and then you want to do again in
italics or control I the name of the
database um for a lot of us that's going
to be
Epco or you know usually EP go then get
rid of your italics again and accessed
it online so we'll do web and then you
want to do again the uh date
accessed which in this case I'll just
say it again 8 February
2013 now this third one here is for a
book it's usually not one we're going to
use we this generation we're researching
everything online for better for worse
but a lot of professors are going to
require that at least one or two of your
sources come from
books from printed material um so same
format you're going to go last name and
then first
name and then instead of quotations this
time we're going to italicize it and put
the title of the book followed by a
period get rid of the italics put the
city where it was
published and then a colon
the name of the publisher the company
that published it uh and then a
comma year it was
published just the year it's all you
need and then since this is a printed
document we write
print and that's
it
um if it was an ebook this is going to
be kind of a newer thing I'm assuming at
this part where it says print you would
just
type ebook like
that
um and then in the actual document
you'll reference the pages that you
use so that should be it those are the I
guess top three most common sources that
are going to be used thanks for watching
