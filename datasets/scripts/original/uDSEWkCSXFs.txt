hello
this is my onion bed and as you can see
it's now empty I've listed all the
unions I've just lived the last the only
in severe toddy beetle
I like West those pebbles they produced
on the bed because I'm going to just the
big test the pH of the bed I'm going to
do some soil testing
okay I'm gonna do it in ten places and
hopefully that will be representative
and that should tell me whether my soil
is right for what I want to grow in it
or whether it needs the pH adjusted
either up or down onions like a pH of
between six and seven
but the real tolerated outside doors
ranges
the will grow outside that range but the
draw better within that range so I'm
going to do now is I'm going to test the
bed to see if I fall within that six to
seven pH range and that would have been
the best French for the onions that I've
just grown what if in fact that could
have been the bed could have made doing
mere better I'll just show you some of
the onions before I make a snap those
are some of the onions that came out
today I'll have to dry those now so I'll
just put those to one side and then
we'll get on with doing this soil
testing now one thing I will say is the
gauge is difficult to sitting outdoors
and particularly if the strong sunshine
the sunshine in the deer so you may have
to take my word for what they gauge
actually reads at times you may not be
able to see the midday so you will have
to take my word for what's actually on
the midday if you can't actually see for
yourself
okay let me just move it easily and out
of the way
this is my start estimator it's a 4 in 1
meter we're only interested in pH today
and I think you can see hopefully you
can see it's actually registering 7 pH
that's pH neutral and that's all was the
start point for this particular type of
MU death
the probs about 8 inches long will
insert it into the raised bed about 7
inches of each of those locations and
will record what we get walking let's do
it
it's just gone down from 76 and it's
just gone down from 6 to 5.5 and now
it's reading a pH of 5 we'll give it a
while to settle itself down and then
we'll make a recording
okay settled on five so just record that
the pH of Fallot
I'm just playing the throw ball
we'll go over there
let's just drop down to six point five
six five point five
looks as though it's steady at 5.5
always gone down to five
extending 5/3 EXO will record that at
5:00 p.m.
in the club off and move down the bed
that shot straight down to five a pH of
five resolving steady 1/3 oh it's gone
down to four point bag
that's quite acidic really and it's
below the range for onions for wandering
between six and seven for care have
steady at 4.5
0:57
it's gone down 65.5
it's loaded in 25.5 it's going down to
five
sold in a side
yep that's a pH of five
shut down to 5.55
holding this five
it's now down to 4.5 so familiar that
it's only in bed back up to a an optimum
level an optimum clean edge with growing
onions this pH needs to be adjusted or
it needs to be less a CD and the way to
do that is to I blind but let's get
finished first let's see where we're at
that's steady on 4.5
there was a road back to 7
koke this is testing my eyesight one end
is a Bentley over we're down to 525
here we steady on five point five clicks
recording okay we're down the other side
now
of your gardening you been okay
I thought I'll care with the calyx with
the debtors have done off here skin
onions disaster some of those only ends
now you all be able to say this but that
meat is just switch itself up it stand
itself out so I have to go and put it
back on
it's morally throw a wobbly I don't know
why that would batter on a one on the
side we just have to ignore that dad and
get lots of Gandalf our looks your
stairs at that other end of the garden
that's steady on five Molly Molly be
quiet please
thank you
what
pretty quiet right
okay six point five so far six
and disguise from city on six
right let's record it
oh just before I forget the knockout and
the pop and it's dr. 5.50 we regarding
5x5
what's your mats like is it any good
because what we're going to do we're
going to average this and then we'll say
let's represent it either the bed
that's 5.5
okay still devote
they work an ugly job for me
you know Don seven
number six I'm a 5.5 yeah this pH has
been part to the law for those onions oh
it's down to five I could have probably
done a lot better today maybe we will do
a lot better next year if we do a bit of
a juice in there yeah that's a pitcher
five
just the one to do
okay plus one
not the 5.55
yep so if this move is ruining the pH of
5 in this location let's record
right
let's see if I can do some mass and make
much yourself all right
just that always dies it back by ten
kids doing 25 25 25
coffee
warm
for a 4.6
forty nine point six now how can you get
a point
six it's impossible or stupid you know
what
you know I'm going to do I'm going to
switch these camera I'm gonna take my
time and what a handy so properly and
give it a correct answer and then we'll
talk about adding Zumba to stalled on
okay just pour this raw put the left
buck down the right five four point five
five four point five five five five
eight in reading what do you married
well I'm going to admit I do vodka
thanks alum pepper blimey anyway its
fifth day isn't it
it's fifty and we divide by ten it's
five so as an average pH in this bed of
five and if we're growing onions we want
it between six and seven and the way
there's the pretty edge make it less
acidic it's to add some lime and that's
what we're going to do now okay let's go
get alive
okay this is the garden line I'm going
to be using I'll just take these matters
off and at first I'm going to broadcast
this line by hand so I'm going to put
some little blobs on for that get the
line off my delicate skin
okay and this is best no idea when it is
until when they like the deer
and I'm just going to use what was left
in the bug okay quantities have no idea
but I don't know that it'll be moving
the pH of this bed in the right
direction or surprise
so for this time to work it will need
some RAM it will need to be walked into
this bed but what I'll do is I'll just
make it into the top layer and let the
winter
sleep on the cabin
well if you want but you just need to
make sure looking
well you gonna put that kettle on and
then we finish there know what the blue
No
okay that y'all
oh they're looking okay
don't care to name
now
one wristband style tested limed soil
inducement well tell you where I've been
you know I'll be popping a video up
shortly and in fact I want because it
probably beat this video off but a
random a local beach together same way
as we had in all them and we will be
doing some winter composting shortly
whether this with your food
okay
way to go posting on YouTube people talk
about huge compost piles and from winter
because it's called the wrap them up in
bubble filled and all carpets and tap
aliens and all kinds well that's not
gonna happen either dome ground bed not
in a garden not inside of the house you
know it just wouldn't happen like the
Chocolate Drops have anything like
you're not bald about every check get it
called as it likes left over the end and
let the worms kiss the sphere the tower
wind it composted
sign it out boy
