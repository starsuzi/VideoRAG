How to Apply Perfume.
A perfume can be a delicious whisper that
reminds people "I'm here"â€”or a booming shout
that hollers "Look!
It's me!"
Make sure your signature scent is saying what
you want it to.
You will need Toiletries that are unscented
or the same scent as your perfume and your
favorite perfume.
Step 1.
Use toiletries that are unscented or in the
same scent as your perfume.
You don't want your shampoo, conditioner,
soap, and deodorant to clash with each other--or
your perfume.
Step 2.
Moisturize, ideally with a lotion or body
oil that has the same scent as your perfume.
Not only does this layer the fragrance, which
helps it last throughout the day, but scent
adheres to moisturized skin better than it
does to dry.
The best time to apply moisturizer is when
you step out of the shower or bath and your
skin is still damp.
Step 3.
If you have a perfume bottle with a spritzer,
then just before getting dressed, spray the
perfume into the air in front of you at chest
level, pause, and then walk through it.
This will give you an even, all-over scent.
Step 4.
Apply the fragrance to any of your pulse points,
where the warmth of your body helps project
the scent more: behind your knees, the inside
of your wrists and elbows, at the base of
your throat, and behind your ears.
Perfume your hair, which will trap the scent
and release it slowly all day, and your ankles,
where it can rise.
Step 5.
Plan to reapply your scent after around 4
hours, but ask someone else to confirm that
you need to.
Because the nose becomes accustomed to smells
over time, you'll probably think the scent
has worn off before it really has.
Step 6.
Since heat and humidity intensify smells,
use a lighter version of your perfume--like
just a lotion, the cologne, or the toilette--in
summer.
Save perfume and parfum, which have higher
concentrations of the scent, for winter.
Don't apply perfume that isn't alcohol-free
before going to the beach--it can irritate
your skin.
Step 7.
Pick a new scent for a very special occasion
or for a vacation, and wear it only during
that time.
Later, when you smell the perfume, your brain
will associate it with the event, and you'll
be flooded with memories.
