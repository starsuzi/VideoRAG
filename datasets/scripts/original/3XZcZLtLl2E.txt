all right we've got the entire project
coated on one side with this
stuff now I'm taking a garbage bag cut
it in
half because it's a real thin pliable
plastic and we want to cover this
so that the product can
work I'm believing so that it doesn't
evaporate and we're going to cover it
all in
plastic and we're going to let it sit 15
to 30 minutes
now
precautions if you've got a nice painted
garage
floor you probably better put something
down because this makes a mess when you
start taking it off now my shop floor is
bare concrete stained up from years of
abuse also
ventilation stuff has has a lot of fumes
so make sure you have adequate
ventilation and we'll check back here in
a little bit and I'll show you how it
comes
off all right we're back on our
test of the adhesive
stripper it's this clean strip adhesive
remover with some
carpet backing and
adhesive now I'm going to fold this
up lay it aside so I can reuse it on
another
part doesn't look a lot
different but it is now I've gotten some
old
newspapers I save my newspapers I use
them for all sorts of
things we're going to take putty knife
it's not all that
sharp we're just going to peel this
stuff up and we're going to use the old
newspaper to deposit it
on it just turns it to hot butter want
you look at that you could hardly blast
that stuff
off with nothing at
all and this does make a mess now be
prepared have your gloves
on eye
protection I want to look at
that that stuff comes off there like
nobody's
business I'm not going to say there
won't be a spot or two you might have to
reapply
it probably where I didn't get it on
there I was seen my right there but look
at that
I mean if it got any easier somebody
else would do it for
you now what I do is when I'm done I
just take a rag with mineral spirits on
it wipe that area really
good and you virtually got just bare
clean aluminum when you're done ready to
scuff up and paint whatever you choose
to do with
it but I'm going to say the clean strip
adhesive
remover I'm going to say this stuff
works
great if their paint remover is this
good oh
man anyway we got the desired
results um
there's other products available I'm
certain this is just what was available
at my local
store uh as I recall it was
2234 a
gallon but if it makes it that easy I
think you'll agree it's well worth
it thank you and come back
soon
