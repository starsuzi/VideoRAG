in today's video I'm going to talk about
roof washing and one thing you really
need to watch out for so have a look at
the photo behind me what you see is a
soup a shoe that's been walking on a
tiled roof have a look at the bottom of
that shoe that is the color of the tile
rubbing off onto the shoe now what
happens when you pressure clean a roof
you mix the water with the color and you
create a big job for yourself if you
don't control the runoff of the water
when you are washing a tile roof be sure
that you know what sort of consequences
you have in washing that roof managing
the color and ensuring you don't stain
your whole house with the color of your
roof
