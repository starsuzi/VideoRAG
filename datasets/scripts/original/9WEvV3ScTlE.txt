hi everyone so today i will be teaching
you how to make this super cute owl
charm and i've gotten a lot of requests
for an owl lately and um this actually
is not my own original design it is the
original design of lumen underscore
weirdos um design and this is an account
on instagram and i believe this was
created by nicole because i think their
account is a collab account but anyways
um she posted a picture of hers to the
tutorials by a and i thought it was so
adorable when i was checking the
pictures in my hashtag
and i contacted her asking if i could
put a tutorial up for her and she said
yes so don't forget to give this video a
thumbs up if you love what you see
already and so now without further ado
let's get started
[Music]
so today you will need any type of loom
a hook and approximately 43 bands for
the
main color of the owl and then six bands
for the inside of its stomach and then
two um orange for the beak and then two
black for the eyes
so we're going to start off at the top
of our loom with our arrows pointing
down
and first we're going to
take a single band and go vertically on
the left
and vertically on the
right so you should have something like
this now
and now we are going to use double bands
for the rest of the
apple
so you're first going to go vertically
in the center
and then you're going to use
double being still
so you should have something like that
now
and now we're going to make one row of
vertical double bands of our main body
color
so you should have something like this
now
now for the center we're going to use
our double orange bands for the beak
so go vertically like that
and now we're going to go back to using
double of our body color bands or main
color bands and go on the left and right
pin bars
vertically
like that so you should have something
like this on your loom now
now we're going to close this off
because this is just the face so
i'm going to use double band still
and sorry if i keep saying that i just
do i want to make sure that you know
what um to do just in case i get
confusing or whatever but
this is what the head looks like now and
we're going to start on the body
so you're going to use double band still
of your body color and you're going to
go outwards here
and go outwards here
so you should have something like this
now
and we're going to use double of our
body colored bands on the left and right
pin bars only so
like that
in the center we are going to start to
use our stomach colorative bands um i'm
using white
so go vertically there
and we're going to make another rub the
same thing again
so use your body colored bands on the
outside
and then use your stomach colored bands
on the inside
like that
and we're going to do the same thing one
more time over here
so
so your loom should look like this now
and we're now going to um start to close
off this figure
so we're going to use double of our
white bands again
or stomach colored bands i guess
and put those going vertically in the
center
and now we're going to use two more of
the color that we used for the beak and
i am so sorry i forgot to say this in
the beginning that you need four of the
be colored orange um so i am very sorry
for that hopefully i'll remember to put
some kind of annotation or something
there so that way you guys can still see
that at the beginning but um you're
going to need two of these bands now so
you're going to take a single band and
wrap it around your hook three times
so you should get something like that
now
and you're going to take double of your
main body colored of bands and you're
going to put those on your hook and
slide the three loops onto it
so you should get something like this
now and this part's a little bit tricky
so be careful but you're going to slide
this onto these two pins right here
so you should get something like that
now
we're going to do the same thing one
last time for the right side
so you're going to wrap a single orange
band around your hook three times like
that and then you're going to take
double of your main body color of bands
and slide those onto your hook and pull
the three loops onto it
so you should get something like this
now
and we're now going to put this on our
loom
and sorry if i sound a little bit weird
my throat is kind of
weird today so
i think i sound a little bit different
but
um you should have something like this
on your loom now
so like i said at the beginning of the
video we only have um
one horizontal band going across our
loom which is what makes this design
really unique and um a lot different
than my other designs because all my
other designs have horizontal bands
going through this so um
we're going to go ahead and do the eyes
now so this time you're going to need
your two black bands
and you're going to start at the head
and you're going to take a single black
band wrap it around this pin on the
right here four times so one
two
three
and four
so you should get something like that
now
and do the same thing on this pin so one
two
three and four so you should have four
loops around these two pins here and
it's okay if you're not to this point
yet um go ahead and pause the video if
you aren't but we're going to take one
of our body color bands
and put those across these three pins
right here so these three pins
and now we are going to do
a small hooking process on the eyes so
you're going to take your hook and we
want to cinch this middle um part here
of the horizontal bands so what you want
to do is take your hook and we're going
to go inside and grab these loops here
for the black
so you can grab one at a time or you can
grab all of them at once it honestly
doesn't matter as long as they all get
pulled over but i'll grab one first grab
it and pull it over the pin and release
and then you can grab as many as you'd
like but if you have a weaker hook then
pull one at a time so that way you don't
break your hook
but
pull over like that so you should get
something like that and do the same
thing to the other side now so
pull this over
and over
so you should have something like this
now on the face
and now we're going to go ahead and
start the entire body's hooking process
so first we need to add a cap band so
take a single band of whatever body
color you have and you're going to wrap
around this bottom pin three times
one two there's my third one so you
should have something like that now and
once you're finished we can now start so
the first band we're gonna hook is this
band right here on the right so just go
inside the cap band
and grab the top two bands other than
the cap band
and hook those over to the right
and then to the left
like that
now we're going to hook the bands that
go forwards
like that and basically you can just
hook these single chains like normal so
i'm just gonna go from left to right
and it's okay if you're a speedy loomer
if you want to speed ahead just because
we're not going to do anything weird or
special to the bands it's just a normal
hooking process here
okay so once you're finished with those
three single chains that run upwards
we're going to hook these two sets of
bands that go inwards so start on the
left and then grab those bands and hook
them inwards
like that and we're going to do the same
thing to the other side
like that
so now we're going to start on the face
so just be careful on this part because
there are a ton of bands and there will
be some pressure on your hook
and make sure you're grabbing the
correct bands
okay so i had some trouble hooking these
uh these bands right here on camera
because i couldn't really move my loom
to see what i was doing so i had to go
off for a second but basically all i did
was hook these two bands outwards that
way and now we're gonna hook this band
on the left
like that and then hook the last bands
vertically like that so it's okay if you
get stuck on this part because even i
had quite a bit of trouble hooking that
so just hook uh just pause the video if
you need a little bit more time but just
hook like normal now the rest of this is
fairly easy
like that and now we're just going to
hook these two outer bands right here so
go on the left pin bar make sure you go
inside the horizontal band and then grab
those and go vertically
like that and do the same thing on the
right side
like that
so you should have something like this
now
and you're now going to go inside and
grab these bands here and hook them to
the right
like that
and then grab these two bands and hook
them to the left like that
so now we're gonna hook these three
bands vertically so just hook this
upwards
upwards and this band upwards oh
goodness
okay there we go
and what we're going to do on all three
of these is tie a slip knot so on the
left you're going to grab the very
bottom band here and do not go inside
the pin stay on the outside and grab
this and pull over the pin and release
same thing on the right side come from
the outside grab this band pull over and
release
then you can give these a light tug not
too tight though because you don't want
to snap the band
like that and then on this pin you can
add a c-clip on here but i'm just going
to tie another knot here to save my
c-clip so i'm just going to grab the
bottom two bands don't go inside the pin
stay on the outside
and grab those two bands and hook over
like that
then you can pull this one a little bit
tighter if you'd like
but now we are pretty much finished with
this owl so i'm not going to remove this
from my loom
and this is what i have now so you
basically just want to
um
well here i'll explain the purpose of
not having horizontal bands um lou and
weirdos said that the purpose of not
having horizontal bands was to make it a
lot easier to
maneuver all the bands around so that
way you can get your desired look so
basically what you want to do is grab
the bottom of its face and pull it
outwards that way you get a really round
face and then pull the body outwards
that way you get a pretty round body too
so that way it's super cute like that
and now we obviously have a ton of bands
that are sticking up over here so i'm
going to show you how to tuck those in
so they should be sticking out towards
one side like all mine are sticking this
way but you're gonna flip to that side
so that way they're sticking out towards
yourself
and stick your hook in a random spot
inside your creation
and then um
grab the band here
and just pull it through that random
spot
so i've hidden this side right here as
you can see nowhere and sticking out and
the middle you can leave it up so that
way you can attach it to your backpack
or anything else so you can hang it but
um you want to tuck in the left side as
well so just stick your hook inside a
random spot inside
your creation
[Music]
there's that and that is pretty much it
so once again this is lumen underscore
weirdos um original design and i believe
it was nicole i think that's a collab
account and i believe nicole designed
this herself and um they are an
instagram account and i actually
contacted them because i thought this
design was super cute and they posted it
to hashtag tutorials by a so that's
pretty much how i saw it but don't
forget to go check their account out so
i really hope you guys like this design
as much as i do again it does not have
horizontal bands so that is an acquired
look that i am not very used to but i am
loving the effect of it and how it makes
this design a lot rounder and so much
cuter so yeah don't forget to give this
