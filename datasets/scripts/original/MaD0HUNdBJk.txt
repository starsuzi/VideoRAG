welcome back to how to cake it Tuesdays
this Tuesday is all about
emojis I'm making four emoji cakes I
start off with very moist chocolate cake
iced in vanilla buttercream and then I'm
going to cover them in the perfect Emoji
yellow fondant I'm cutting out the
facial expressions using a template and
placing them on the cakes I find using a
template helpful because it's really
straight forward and then you get all
the components bang on I mean these
emojis are pretty much famous so you
can't make a different face and claim
that that's kissy face emoji everybody
knows what she looks
like or is it like no it's
not someone look it up which way is
it when people ask me if I've ever
dropped a cake my emoji face
is people love that question question
and they actually want me to say yes but
the answer is no I need wood cuz I was
smart assy about
that okay I'm going to remove my four
chocolate cakes from their pans I'm
going to level them and cut them with a
serrated knife and a ruler and then I'm
going to give them a crumb coat and
chill them in the fridge I crumb coat my
cakes in order to hold the crumbs to the
cake so that when I return to them and
Ice them there's no crumbs in the final
coat the only emojis missing are cake
emojis there's two cake emojis right
there's the whole cake and then there's
the slice of that whole cake there's
zero diversity where's the fondant cake
where's the novelty cake once my Crum
coat is chilled I ice my cakes one more
time with delicious vanilla buttercream
and chill them once again I actually
researched emojis for these cakes and
the one emoji that's like this
do you know that's actually a grin who
grins like that I thought it was like
grimacing but it's a
grin now that the Emojis are nice and
cold I'm going to cover them in our
Emoji yellow fondant when I dyed the
fond in I actually held my iPhone beside
me well I didn't hold it I need two
hands to die fond it but I had it beside
me just to make sure I got the yellow
just right I roll out my yellow fondant
to about an e of an inch thick and then
I pick it up and lay it over my cake and
make sure to smooth out the top and
smooth out the sides being careful not
to trap any air bubbles inside and
working kind of quickly so that the
fondant doesn't start to crack or tear
there's no bubble emoji face you can't
have an air bubble in your emoji cake
there's no cracked head emoji so we want
these cakes to be nice and smooth once
I've covered all four of my chocolate
cakes with yellow fondant I roll out my
different color fondants for all the
different Expressions that I'm making
like this
expression this is called the YouTube
smile I simply made myself a template by
enlarging the Emoji pictures on my
computer to the size of the cake and
then I plac that piece of paper on the
appropriate colored fondant and Trace
along it with my knife
[Music]
I need an emoji that represents my skin
tone there's no curly headed Emoji
excuse there's no redhe headed Emoji oh
you just added a Canadian flag oh thanks
we're only the second largest country in
the world thanks thank you there's no CN
Tower Emoji in the
buildings what is that what is that as I
cut out all the components for my four
different emoji faces I have to be
really careful to keep the right eyeball
with the right eyebrow with the right
mouth I'm not I'm not doing an
experiment I'm not creating new
faces so I start off with the cheeky
Emoji that's what I've named
him who makes that face I've never made
that face in my life except right now
but I use that emoji I happen to be kind
of sarcastic and that doesn't translate
via text or email so winky he is my best
friend because I can write anything as
dryly as I want and I just add a and
then people are like oh she's
joking I'm going to keep my template
beside me while I assemble the cheeky
emoji face I even use the template to
help set the pieces in place to make
sure they're exactly in the right spot I
don't want his eye to be too high or too
droopy got to get it just right this is
not Frankenstein Emoji this is cheeky
Emoji then I move on to sunglass
Emoji I chose sunglass Emoji because
he's such a cool dude he looks so
laidback no matter what you write to
somebody he's like yeah he's so cool I
want to hang out with him I wear my
sunglasses and so I can so I can't I
look ridiculous in sunglasses I never
wear sunglasses I look like Slash from
Guns and Roses I'm ready to move on
to what is his name he's the laughing
emoji he laughs so hard that he
cries does he show teeth
no I plac the tears on the cake under
the eyes with a big smiley face he's
adorable he's adorable then I move on to
the kissy face face
emoji I look like I'm in
pain oh I got to chill out hold
