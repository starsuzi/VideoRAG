[Music]
for the side buttons there's two of them
right there to take out you just go
ahead and pop them out with a little
screwdriver
Flathead
you can see
they're two separate pieces
here so I'm just going to separate
them pull that
out and then the second piece will come
right
out okay and then to put them back when
you're done the exact same in
reverse and that's
it all right so for these for in the
handle and down here they're both work
the same way with the clips
um just take like a Phillips head
screwdriver push the little clip and
pull the piece
out and then you can access a couple
screws that are inside there there's a
screw inside
there then we take this one
off you have those two screws in there
you take those off and then take the
handle off I'll show you to take the C
clip
out then we pull the door frame up and
out in order to get this uh C clip off I
just took a
little um trick that I learned off
YouTube where I take a paper clip and
just twist the end of it like the sew
and then use it to hook the C
clip and then you can pull it out with
your pliers so once it's hooked on once
the C clip comes out you can take the
handle off and get to the
door once you get the panel off you just
have to remove the plastic uh you can
use like
a screwdriver of some sort I've already
come taken it off a bit it'll peel back
it'll expose the window gears and then
we'll take a look at
that
okay so you can see there's a little
plastic clip that goes onto the window
and this goes through the little hole
the bottom of the window and when when
that's
on it'll then slide down and this metal
bracket will clip into the window and
that's what holds the whole window
together and there's another
one right in there it's hard to see so
that one there I'm just going to do
without on camera but it's exactly the
same process
and uh then it'll hook the window back
up
over I don't know if you can see
the the actual
window yeah we can see the window
okay go ahead and I get this clip on
here so that Clips onto the window and
this
piece grab
that
squish it in I'm just going
[Music]
to there so you just roll it all the way
up and use the pressure of the the
actual window going up and pushing
against the top and it pushed the clips
into place and now they're holding on to
the window that's it Windows
fixed it's already recording
all right so to get this back on this is
just the pressure for the what is that
for for opening the
door and that connects to this little
thing here you can see when I pull the
door it moves this little valve which
would pull this so to hook that up it's
just
simply goes into place actually this is
going to
go so it slips into that hole
inside there we go snaps in you can see
them sticking in the inside and that
hooks onto the little part on the door
here right here so put the washer
on and put the door back on the
handle just by pushing it
on now we got ourselves a door window
that
works and that's
it once you get your door reassembled
you just go ahead and put your screw
back in here and two screws back in here
and your little covers on and you're
back ready to
go
