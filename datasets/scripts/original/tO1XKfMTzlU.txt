welcome to Simple Solutions Diva I'm
Laura bori and I just love finding
simple kitchen tips that make my life a
little easier and this one is all about
how to slice an apple for The Lunchbox
and honestly I think this is brilliant
it keeps the Apple from browning so come
in closer and I'm going to show you how
to do it you want to put your Apple on a
good cutting surface and have a sharp
knife handy and we're going to cut this
apple in four places
and you're basically isolating the core
of the Apple so I'm going to cut here
here here
and here
and let me just start off so we've got
one
we've got
two
we've got
three I'm gonna go gently on this
and then last but not least
slice number four
and this is going to this is isolating
trying to do this pieces don't go flying
everywhere now
as you can see I'm going to reassemble
this
and here's the cool part you aren't
going to waste a baggie
you aren't going to allow the Apple to
Brown because you're going to take a
rubber band I got this rubber band off
of a a
grouping of asparagus
so I know it's food safe
and you just use the rubber band
to reassemble the Apple
it does not oxidize and you can pop this
in your kids lunch
and they have great yummy apple sliced
apples and all all they have to do is
get rid of that core and they can eat it
up
so that is my simple kitchen tip for
today thank you for joining me and we'll
see you next week on simple
