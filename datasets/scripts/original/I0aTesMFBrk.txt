Today on the best-ever food review show we eat Kwek kwek.
What the hell is that? Let's find out.
[BEST-EVER INTRO]
We're doing some videos about some of the most popular, interesting Filipino food.
Uh. Hi there. Can I? I just wanna get your opinion on.
Okay. That's fine.
Do you know Kwek kwek? The food.
The egg?
Do you like it?
Yeah.
What is Kwek kwek?
An egg, wrapped with flour.
Kwek kwek is a quail egg, deep fried in orange batter.
Cut.
We're gonna go. I'm gonna go. Try it out.
Hi. Is this Kwek kwek?
Yes, sir.
I want to try it.
Ten pesos, for one stick?
Yes, sir.
Alright, so this is a Kwek kwek.
The quail egg with the orange batter.
Here we go.
It's funny cause there's like fifteen people here watching me.
Okay, here we go.
Whoah.
Is this what they use for Kwek kwek?
Yes.
So this is quail egg and they put on the batter?
The orange batter?
Yes.
Why is it orange?
The food color.
Food coloring?
Yes.
Just so it looks flashy?
Yeah.
It seems like the orange color of the Kwek kwek is nothing more than food coloring.
This makes sense as a flashy way to bring people to your fried egg stand.
You can call it egg bling.
It's like doughnut consistency wrapped around an egg. Which is really confusing at first.
It's not sweet though.
Okay. I'm gonna try it. They say try it with vinegar.
I'm gonna put some vinegar on it.
I don't like cucumber.
I eat a lot of things but I don't eat cucumber
*Deep sensual voice over* You wanna know how they make the Kwek kwek?
First, they take those shells off the eggs.
We gotta put the egg in a little bit of this flour stuff, right here
That's before we put it in this batter, that's colored orange.
Then we gotta fry the Kwek kwek
Oooh, that looks so good.
Finally, it's ready to eat.
The vinegar brings out a whole different flavor. I don't know how to describe it.
I would say it's first of all, vinegary
Of all the fried part of it it's not crunchy it's more like doughy
It helps that the egg is kinda small. You can eat it in one bite
I know they have it with bigger eggs. Maybe I'll try that
But I think that it would be way too much, you know, protein to dough ratio.
One, two, Three. Kwek kwek!
Okay. Now say Best Ever Food Review Show
Best.
Okay, hold on.
Big ol' chicken egg right here.
It's delicious.
And also, not that bad.
A good way to get some protein if you're out in the streets.
Okay, so that's Kwek kwek. It's great.
I have no scale.
I think rating scales are archaic and cruel.

Who is your favorite Power ranger?
The beef.
You know, the beef.
The beef? I think the beef ranger is also my favorite.
I mean between the chicken ranger and the Tilapia Power ranger. That's a good one.
