so what I have here is a handheld
air-raid siren I'm using my cordless
angle grinder so I'm eating a prototype
to see if it would work and it works but
it's a little bit rough I do now is just
modify it and refine it I'll show you
what I got so far throughout the video
I'll be testing the siren and I'll keep
it at a lower volume up until the end
and then it will be at full volume
so to start I have taken apart my angle
grinder and I've measured this piece and
it is 2 inches and that will match my
Forstner bit
perfect fit
so I've made this small block and I put
a bolt in it and it all attached to this
piece
here I have divided this circle and cut
out one of the blades and mark this
piece here so I can cut seven more
blades
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
here I just made a small jig and this is
so I can trim the rotor so it is
completely round
[Music]
I can do this on the table saw or I can
do it with the belt sander
so I'm changing my plans a little bit I
tested this one in my grinder so it blew
off all the blades I was going to make
it like this and then put my second
stator on top of here but it this one
pulled up but I guess the other one went
way too fast so it blew them all off
so I've reduced them to this size and
now I can glue this piece on here
so I glued seven blades on the bottom
and I'll put eight blades on the top
so just put a string onto my belt sander
and tied it to the rotor and you can see
it's not balanced properly so I'll
remove some of the wood on the one side
to help balance it out so I've drilled a
few holes and it looks a lot better now
but taking off the old router out of my
prototype and I just put the new one end
to see if it would work and I'll still
have to build a better stator I almost
put my ear plugs
that works really good so to turn in
this screw and I had to make this little
tool here so it just fits like that and
now I can turn it in so I've cut seven
pieces here and they will be the stator
so I'll glue them on to here
well just cut this ring in I'll glue it
on top of here like so here I've marked
eight of these pieces and they will glue
onto here so the top one has eight and
the bottom has seven and that'll give it
a two-tone pitch
now these blocks are dry and I just cut
this ring and you know I'll glue this
onto here and then it'll be complete
now it's ready for testing here I'm
going to test it and you may want to
turn your volume down
