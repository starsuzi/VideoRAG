Year's
what's that
Black Eyed Peas hey guys I'm Shantae
from natural veganmama.com where we're
all about showing you how easy this
vegan lifestyle can be today we're
making Black Eyed Peas
at the end of the recipe I'm giving you
three reasons to go vegan this year if
you aren't already now let's make those
Black Eyed Peas
I'm starting with one 14 ounce bag of
dry Black Eyed Peas
I'm soaking them overnight and I filled
the water all the way to the top of the
container
next I'm rinsing the beans
here I have one cup of vegetable stock
I'm also using two cups of spring water
now I'm melting about two tablespoons of
vegan butter
I'm using about three scallion
I chopped them to about a half an inch
or a quarter of an inch and now I'm
sauteing them
here I've added onion red pepper yellow
pepper and bell pepper
now just mix all of those guys together
make them one happy family get them nice
and coated with the butter
here I have one teaspoon of black pepper
here I've combined about two tablespoons
of tarragon garlic and salt
here's one teaspoon of liquid smoke
and now you see all our veggies have
Blended up nicely they're nice and
sauteed
I've added them to the Black Eyed Peas
I'm using the crock pot which is an
amazing time saver
I'm using five bay leaves
and we're just going to put those bad
boys in there and they're going to give
our Black Eyed Peas a wonderful flavor
well just let's mix all of our friends
up let them get to know each other very
well all those seasonings let all of
that blend make sure everything is nice
and Blended before you remove that spoon
and put that lid on
I put my crock pot on low so it would
take about six to seven hours to cook
fully I also have a high setting if I
wanted it to cook in four hours but that
those are the settings that I have on my
crock pot and this is the end result
they came out so good
here are three reasons to go vegan this
year
reason number one animals feel pain
period
reason number two eating meat increases
your chance of heart disease by 50
percent
reason number three seventy percent of
the grain that's grown in the United
States it's grown for animal consumption
hundreds of millions of people in the
world are hungry all of that grain that
we're growing for animal consumption
could be grown to help
Stamp Out Hunger
