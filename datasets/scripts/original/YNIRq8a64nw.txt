hi guys today we're going to make a
Rainbow Loom popsicle charm or bracelet
and uh it's a fairly easy tutorial what
you're going to need for this are three
colors uh the color of your choice for
the popsicle color white you know to
create kind of a little creamsicle look
on the bottom and a brown color or a
black color for the popsicle stick and
then when we're all done you can do it
in a variety of colors and Link it
together and make a bracelet so let's
get started on this we're going to use
double bands so on everything make sure
you use two bands we're going to start
with the arrow pointed away from us
point it up and we're going to move out
and up to our
left there's your first set of double
bands we're going to do four more going
up
one 2
2
3 and the fourth
color will be your
white there's
four now we're going to do the middle
again a total of four going up three of
the colors and the one of the white so
one
two and if this is going too fast press
your pause button or your space bar
deposit in between each
move
three now use double
whites it's
four okay now we're going to go out and
up and do the exact same thing we did on
the left side
and on the last one you're going to use
your
whites okay now in the middle one we're
going to put the Browns to finish it off
again double bands going to do two of
those there's
one there is
two okay that's what it looks like now
we're going to turn the Loom all the way
around
with this arrow point it down point it
towards
us now we're going to put our brace
bands on you don't want to put it on
this top one you want to put the second
down and use the same color as your
Popsicle and just make it in a
triangle go to the next one
down do exactly the same
go down one
more for our last one here we're going
to use the white since you have white on
the
bottom you're going to make a
triangle but on this one you want to
grab grab it with your hook and put it
over that metal peeg just like that only
on this one
that's going to help in the hooking
process now what we want to do is put
three cap bands on two whites on each
saw outside so one and two and then one
down here on the bottom of the popsicle
stick so on this cap band normally you
wrap it around so it goes around twice
you'll go like this
and wrap it like this this time we're
going to take it we want to wrap it
really tight so we want to wrap it on
like
that wrap it around
again that way if you look at it it's
going to be wrapped
around three times let's do that
again so on this
wrap it
around it goes
twice and this
goes three
times so see how this cap band's wrapped
around three times and then you have
your other band make sure these two
bands are on the bottom so you can go
under and hook
those going to do the same one over
here it easier with my right hand so
here's
that's around
twice that's around your third
time again over here make sure your two
bottom bands are pushed down the other
cap bands are to the top want to do the
same that middle one and the
brown so that wraps it around so it's
now wrapped around
twice do it one more
it's wrapped around three times okay
there you
go so now it's time to hook our
popsicle we're going to go up here the
hook away from you go under your cap
bands grab those bottom two white bands
and hold your cap
down there you go
now I'm going to go under that green
brace
band grab those bottom
two going to do this all the way up to
the
top and then once you get to the top
we're going to take this one and bring
it in and up right
there now we're going to do the same in
the middle
row go under those two the cap
band grab your band hold this so it
doesn't pop
off there's
one do this all the way
up okay now it's time to do this on the
side
go under your cap bands grab those
bottom two whites hold this
down bring it
up do this all the way up to the
top and now bring
it into the middle okay that's how it
looks we're ready to take it off
now so at the very top you want to make
sure you take this hook and put it down
through all of these bands grab the same
color
band tuck it under go
through see how you've got your two grab
that pull it
over that's going to secure all of those
bands if you didn't get all of those
bands secured it will fall
apart okay now it's time to pull it off
take your hook put it all the way down
through make sure it goes on the thick
part of the hook or it'll break off and
gently pull it
off there you
go your little Rainbow
Loom popsicle or
dreamsicle
creamsicle charm we're going to take
three colors of these and and put them
together with our c clips and then
finish it off for a bracelet this works
also as a charm if you wanted to do just
a regular bracelet and hang it on the
charm you can certainly do that too okay
so now that we have uh our popsicles
done we're going to show you how to put
it together like this bracelet here and
for this what you will
need are two SE Clips to attach it there
two SE Clips to attach it there and then
one to attach the
bracelet I'm going to show you kind of
how to attach them together cuz you will
need two c clips for
each turn it
around back here what you want to do is
make sure you get the uh the charm part
tucked in if you're not going to use it
as a charm so you go under there and
grab make sure you don't do it out here
but make sure you do it in the middle
you're going to kind of do it right
right there and right
here grab two of your bands to hold on
to
there and then tuck that into that c
clip on this
side how to okay so take this
bin put it
down go under inside of
it grab one band
here pop it into that c clip right there
grab another one right
there kind of do it in the one from the
second
row this
one and bring it over and tuck it in
that way it's tight enough that when you
put it on your wrist it stays
together going to do the exact same
thing a little lower again go in
here grab those there
put those
two your C club right
there going to go over here and grab the
same
too but on this side you kind of want to
do one at a time so
pop
one one in
there's your second one attached so see
how it's attached in the back like that
and it's attached like that you're going
to do the same thing to the next
one one man there
there one
okay
okay so now so now we're going to attach
our popsicles in the back we going to
double
band and go up arrow point it up of
course point it away from you go up
two double bands you can do single if
you want to as well it doesn't matter on
this go up about halfway for a kid's
wrist a little farther up for an adult
wrist okay now that we've gotten about
halfway we're going to take our Loom and
turn it around arrows now point it down
point it towards you you're going to
find halfway down your
Popsicle and don't grab on the very
outside CU it'll look a little weird but
just grab those two
right right there on the inside grab
those and put those over the tippy top
of
this
okay we're going to go under the two
green bands
and we're going to hook all the way
up now that we're at the top we're going
to add our C clip on this side of the
bracelet a lot of times what I do so it
doesn't mess up is I attach it while
it's still
attached make sure it go through all of
the bands or it'll fall apart okay now
it's
attached pull it
off that's your first half of your
bracelet you're going to do the exact
same thing on the other side attach it
and you'll have your bracelet so once
again Arrow starts pointed away from you
double
band about half the way up
okay now we're going to take it turn it
around point it towards
you go to your last White Band
here we're going to go in right
here grab
two right there in the
middle put it on the
top go
under grab those white
pands and hook all the way to the
top okay now when we're up here we're
going to take this off with our
hook okay an easier way would be to go
and attach it while it's still
on the other side of the C
clip oops almost all the way
through through all of
those okay now you can pull it
off there you go now you have
