hi this is Jeff Ryland with abundant
[Music]
design now that we've got our natural
Edge in we can be done but since it is
dirt to mulch that mulch will eventually
break down the Grassroots will come in
or the bed Roots will go out and
there'll be a battle you can uh just
wait and every years recut that natural
Edge and you'll be just
fine alternatively you can use a more
permanent Edge Rock either Boulder or
actual cement or cut rock with the stone
edging instead of beveling back up into
the bed you just have a flat spot um at
the bottom uh however wide your stone is
and then bevel back from the back side
of that or you can use the plastic
edging and if you go the plastic edging
route get um the heaviest that you can
um usually the box stores are going to
have some pretty flimsy stuff um which
which is fine um but uh it it has a
tendency to Kink um and it's just less
durable so we'll go ahead and show you
how to put this uh plastic edging in so
for the edging we'll bring it up flush
to the
cement and we'll put a Fastener through
the through the side and
into the dirt in the yard and that will
hold that um until we get material on
the
bedside now work our way around the
curve putting the edging
in the edging comes with these
connectors and you could just connect
them together that would butt them up
tight but the joint would be weak so
what we'll do is cut
here and here and that will give us an
extra bit of flap to
overlap and that will give it strength
and we'll put the Fastener through both
pieces of the edging
and the cheap stuff cuts a lot easier
there we go
put it in
place and put our
Fastener right
there okay so there we've got our edging
in and join us next time
and we'll finish this bed off thanks for
stopping by till next time this is Jeff
Ryland with abundant
