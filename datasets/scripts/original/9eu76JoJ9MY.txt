word to the wise if you want to save
time money effort and decrease the
chances of you messing up your cake by
having to flip it out the pan uh crumb
coat it and do all that kind of stuff
what you can do is just simply bake your
cake in the pan without the wax paper at
the bottom or the parchment paper and
just simply DEC cool it decorate it and
then just cut it from the pan and serve
it like that if you're just having a
simple celebration serving your cake
straight from the pan saves you lots of
time and effort because you don't have
to ice these sides do a border crumb
coat it flip it out the pan and all that
kind of stuff and it's less of a
headache actually I prefer to eat it
from the pan if I'm just having a simple
celebration but if I'm going all out and
people are going to see the cake then I
flip it out the pan so if you're
interested in seeing how to flip the
cake out the pan to look like a sheet
cake which it is then continue watching
this video if not if you just want a
simple cake at home then you can stop
the video right
here at this point I'm just going to
trim my crusty side since I had to bake
it so
long and right now I'm peeling off the
parchment paper that I had on there and
don't worry about cake falling off cuz
we're going to shape this and we're
going to crumb coat
it
I know the first time I saw someone do
this I was like what the heck are they
doing they messing up the cake but be
patient you'll see the results
momentarily now you should use a
serrated
knife to get those
crumbs
okay and I have my pastry brush I'm just
going to brush off those excess crumbs
in my work
area
M nice and more
now keep in mind when you're using whole
wheat pastry flour that's vegan friendly
your uh vanilla cake is still going to
look kind of dark and if I would have
added the dark vanilla extract it would
have looked even
darker now there are some of cake
flowers out there that are purely white
that you can use if you want that Pure
White looking cake I'm still trimming
and I'm making sure that my sides are
even so I have an even
cake it's best that you cool your cake
for about maybe 35 to 40 minutes before
you even attempt to take it out the pan
even with the parchment paper lining I'm
going to transfer this baby to the
cooling rack and I'm going to let it sit
there for about 20 minutes and then
we'll come back and we'll begin our
crumb coat which is the first step of
icing a cake that has been
trimmed as you can see that I trimmed a
little more of my top off so I can have
a more even cake and since my cake is so
moist I can kind of just press it the
way I want now let me share with you my
simple syrup which is just half sugar
and half water which I boil for about 5
minutes I'm going to add some of this
on with my pastry
brush and it makes the cake extra moist
and extra
sweet not that it needs extra moisture
but it's just something I like it makes
a big difference if you use it you will
know exactly what I'm talking
about so I just wanted to share that
with you now notice if you did your cake
right and you did your egg replacable
properly then your cake will not fall
apart even after trimming so don't fret
just keep
trimming if your cake falls apart then
you may want to go back and check and
see if you did the steps
correctly this is what they do in the
bakeries by the way this is not some
crazy idea I came up with
okay I'm sprinkling a little simple
syrup on my
sides trust me if you eat this cake the
next day or two days later this simple
syrup is going to make a whirl of a
difference because it keeps the cake
super moist just melt in your mouth all
you will need is a glass of milk with
it never mind my counter I'm so used to
using it as a project table it's just
become all purpose for
me okay now we're going to resume the
cooling
process more
I
want to make sure you get frosting all
on the edges of the
cake I'm just going to skim as we go
now we're going to work our
edges get over here so you can see what
I'm
doing don't about the board it will be
cleaned later after we finish
decorating I got music going I don't
like to talk while on Chrome coding cuz
I like to concentrate so just enjoy my
background music as I do
this
I'm going to let this cake sit in the
fridge overnight so the crumb coat can
dry and then we will do the final cat
tomorrow all right we are back from our
inter
and it's time to ice the
cake see how stiff the crumb coat
is and if you're looking at my cakeboard
yes I did make this myself as you can
see so I'm going to dress that up before
I put it in the
Box because sometime sometimes if you go
to a craft store it's hard to find the
cakeboard that you're looking for or the
one that will fit the perfect size cake
so you have to get creative and just use
whatever's available and sometimes it's
just cardboard that you decorate with
gift wrapping
paper all right we're going to just pile
it on and as we go along we're going to
scrape and trim with my Baker's
blade
okay also please make make sure that
your icing is thick enough and stiff
enough so that it will not start sliding
off of the cake because even if the cake
is fully cooled it can still slide off
if it's not stiff
enough and if you're going to do a
border then it has to be even stiffer
than your base icing and just in case
you're wondering what the base icing is
this is the base
icing now it's time to border our
slides all right there's the
Border pretty good run amate Cake at
least I think so if you want to continue
you can go around the top and do the
Border but I'm not going to mess with
that I'm just going to leave it as is
because like I say it's a basic cake
just to show you what to
do
because if your icing stays room
temperature too long or if you're in a
room where you just got finished baking
the icing will start to sweat no matter
how thick it is and that is so
annoying those edges are so
tricky all
right give it a try and let me know what
you think peace out and happy vegan
eating
