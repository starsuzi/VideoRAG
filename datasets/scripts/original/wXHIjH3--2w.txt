hey this is David the Shepherd School
and uh we're outside on the back of my
Hill looking at some of my raised beds
and when I put these in here basically I
just wanted something the dog couldn't
use to climb under the fence and I
thought as an added
bonus I could plant some stuff and I got
some shade loving plants and put in
there but there's just a little too
shady for anything other than the you
know Woodland type
vegetation and so I couldn't really find
anything to to plant back here so what I
did is that ordered some jining seeds
and these are stratified seeds which are
basically um the seeds that have been
stored under um artificial conditions
that kind of match nature for a couple
years because the seeds have to go
through some uh Heating and Cooling
Cycles um which mimic you know a couple
years in the
ground before they uh they actually are
able to germinate and they don't
normally just plant them and let them do
it naturally because rodents and such
would tend to eat the seeds so I got
them uh from a uh online supplier didn't
cost me too much it was like I think 20
or 30 bucks for 100 seeds and we're
going to plant them out here now
planting Jens sing the more natural you
could have it as far as conditions go
the better quality seed you have and
basically you have to just plant it and
let it sit because they're not going to
actually start producing berries and and
more seeds for about four years 3 or
four years and they're not going to be
able to be harvested for at least 6
years the
roots and uh you know 10 years or so
will give you the most valuable Roots so
what I plan on doing is planting them
here next year I'll plant them in that
one then I'll come down in the next year
and that one and the next year and so on
and so forth I figure after a couple
years I will uh stop buying seeds be
able to use my own and when I get to
that point I throw them back there at
the woods but for now just to kind of
see what happens I'm going to plant them
basically what you're going to do is uh
make little
about4 in
troughs in the in the ground and put the
seeds about every inch or so apart and
put the rows about um 6 in or so apart
and over the years each year you're
going to lose some so by The End by the
Harvest time you'll only have you know
uh sparely interpers seeds you're not
going to get near what you planted so
better to plant a little in the
beginning and once I plant them and I'm
going to have the rows go
down following the Contour of the slope
rather than across you know like uh you
know like Terraces or
whatever they prefer a a alomi Airy soil
no clay moist but well drained and good
shade so this should work real good and
after I'm done I'm going to put Mulch on
it some straw mulch so let me make my
furrows it's
September and September October is when
you plant and that happens to
be when most of the uh seed
companies have seed of them so now cover
them back up with
some with some
so and I'm kind of wanting to
stimulate wild
Gro so I'm not going to do much with
these I'm just going to let them
sit let me get some uh
straw so there you go
I put the seeds in and uh buried
them and then mulched it with some
straw don't expect much of an update on
this because uh I want to simulate wild
conditions so I'm not going to mess with
it pruning it or
anything however when uh when and if any
plants come up I might show you what
they look like about once a year until
it's time to uh
to actually harvest the berries and
stratify the berries and turn them into
seeds and actually harvest in the roots
of course that's 10 years from now
there's no telling I'm be living here in
10 years but uh that's all there is
until next time you can always catch
online at
www. teen gun.com I've got a
plan fits my point of
view I'm I'm getting ready to
