Hello friends, I welcome you to my channel Happy plants.
In today's video, I will talk about growing broccoli plants in pots.
Broccoli is a tasty and healthy vegetable.
It's my one of the favourite vegetable.
It can be grown in pots if you consider a few things about it.
To grow it first you have to do its seedling separately.
Plant its seeds in a seedling tray and make saplings first.
Its seeds start to sprout on the 3rd day.
When saplings are of 20-25 days transfer them to pots.
It will not grow well in very hot summer days so...
transfer to pots when weather is moderate.
No pot size is important as you can see plants grow pretty big so...
you need at least 12 or 14-inch pot for them.
12-inch pots will do, but 14(14 inches Wide) inch is the best size for them.
I have used 12-inch pots as they were available to me at the moment.
Soil combination I have used is 2 part mud, 1 part compost, 1 part sand.
Friends Broccoli is a vegetable that needs a lot of sunlight.
On Earth, it can't be grown in shade or low light conditions(Output will not be good).
Keep them in a sunny location.
Its head is not big like cauliflower but its more nutritious.
Harvest it when the head is of 5-6 inches.
If wait too long its buds may start to bloom and taste get wasted.
You can cut it with some knife etc.
I will cut this one and show you how to do it.
Now some other small size broccolis will also grow ...
on this plant if you let it remain there.
They won't be big like main head but they will be something.
Broccoli takes a good amount of time It does not grow fast.
On average it can take at least 3 months from seed to harvest.
At the start it may need some less water but when the plant is...
big it sucks lot of water so you have to water it almost on daily basis.
Broccoli is my favourite vege, we especially make "Parhtas" from it.
Thanks for watching sub for more take care bye.
