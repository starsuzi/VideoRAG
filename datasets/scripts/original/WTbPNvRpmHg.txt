hey guys welcome to my kitchen
i want to show you how to make a
beautiful marinade now you can use it
pretty much for any kind of steak uh you
could actually even use it for a chicken
you could use it really for any type of
meat
that you're going to put on the grill
it's going to be nice and hot it's a hot
summer day right here in casanova and i
mean hot we got a little fan going here
which you can't see
my dad always said if you can't take the
heat in the kitchen get out i haven't
gotten out yet but in any case
we want to make a great marinade so
we're going to start with a really high
quality extra virgin olive oil
don't know where i could get that oh my
gosh i could get that from the shores
of polia italy so if you guys haven't
gone to our website yet or you can get
it right from our
facebook or there's a link right under
youtube don't forget to grab our uh
julia grown um extra virgin italian
olive oil
beautiful olive oil if you haven't had
the real stuff
oh boy i'll tell you that is just
absolutely delicious so we
we've got right here about two thirds of
a cup of extra virgin if you don't chose
olive oil okay
and then what we've got here is a third
of a cup of good high quality balsamic
vinegar
now what's the deal here traditionally
you do what you want to do
one third part if you will of an acid
and that's what vinegar is going to
bring it's going to bring a delicious
flavor
along with the oil and again that's
going to give you the perfect mix on
your palate
as far as flavor goes and it's going to
give it a nice mix in an effort to break
down some of that connective tissue and
enter within the meat that's what you
want to do you want to create a mixture
that allows it to get into meat all
right so
that being said we want to flavor it
with onion
uh so i've got a third of a golden onion
that i chopped up for you
oh that's got a little bit of bite too
it doesn't and then here's my favorite i
don't know about you guys but
oh garlic i'll tell you that is good
stuff so we've got one large clove of
garlic
and you guys can know that you can do
anything you want so i'm giving you
ingredients on how i do it
but if you guys want to add a little
something else go for it you know it
doesn't matter
here's our rosemary got a beautiful
fresh rosemary plant right there
i don't remember if it's rosemary or
oregano that helps you with your memory
i still can't remember it's got to be
oregano okay it's not a funny joke and
then here we go we got a little time so
what i've got is one tablespoon one
tablespoon of rosemary
and one teaspoon of thyme wouldn't it be
great if you could take time and
and do it that way of course i'm talking
about that kind of time we're gonna do
some salt we're gonna do some pepper
we're gonna mix it in a bowl so this is
probably one of our simplest little
recipes here we're gonna take our olive
oil
watch this one more this is not
complicated at all the goal is here let
me try that just to make sure it's
not amazing that fruit you squeeze it
you crush it
grows right off a tree all that's all
this beautiful balsamic
vinegar and comes right from italy
gorgeous
so there we go we've got some thyme
we've got our oregano
oh i don't know about you guys i love a
regular go so well with uh
i'm sorry rosemary i said oregano goes
so well with chicken
or a meat lamb just absolutely delicious
and then i'm gonna take my garlic
and i'm just going to squish that in
there i'm going to take my onion
i'm going to do a nice neat job in the
kitchen so i don't make a mess
my father loving the depth the messiest
cook you'd ever be about
me i'm probably a little bit on the
other side i'm a little bit too
too neat all right so then i'm going to
hit my salt
and that'll dissolve so you're going to
use you know depending on what you want
to do there
we're going to use a good teaspoon of
salt is what i'm hitting
okay and then i'm going to hit some
pepper now you want to hit a lot of
ground black pepper
so i got black peppercorns in here we're
going to crush it
that's a good salad dressing kind of
there too right i'm thinking a little
mozzarella a little tomato
right let it set you're going to stir it
how easy is that isn't that great
hardest part about this recipe is
shopping for the
for the ingredients isn't it oh
all right guys and that's it that's how
simple this is we decided to put it
right over a beautiful flank steak which
we're making today
i'll tell you that is so oh that is so
delicious you could actually use that
right over like a caprese salad if you
wanted
so you could use that what we call a
marinade you could use it right as a
salad dressing as well
but it's easy and it's simple and it's
fresh and it just gives you that bite
that
smell of italy with whatever you put it
on which is absolutely delicious so
we're real excited we're gonna let this
marinate for a few hours we're gonna pop
it on a hot grill it's gonna be
absolutely delicious kids are gonna love
