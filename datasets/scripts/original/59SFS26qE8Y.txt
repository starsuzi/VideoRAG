hey guys so this is going to be a quick
little video and I'm going to show you
guys this really it's not really hard
but it's really frustrating thing it's
how to get slime off of your
carpet now you can see here that I
definitely have slime and it's actually
still it's actually dried up now so it's
going to be hotter if you can see this
is my room because we're actually doing
a bunch of rearranging and stuff to my
room like improvements and stuff so it's
really bad like literally there is no
ground but yeah so in all this pile my
slime thing opened up and spilled over
there throwing this out but it's not
that bad because this is actually the
Slime that I was going to throw out
anyways so what you're going to need is
a spoon like cotton balls or cotton pads
um rubbing alcohol
water with
soap and stain remover but this is
actually I'm not even sure if I'm going
to need this so I guess this is actually
optional you don't need it basically
with the end of the spoon you just want
to like scrape it to try and get any
slime that might just like come
off so none of it actually really came
off but it did make it looser as you can
tell
so now what you're going to do is you're
going to take your rubbing alcohol and
your cotton pads and you're just going
to continuously like rub it basically
just take this take one of your cotton
bads or cotton
balls and get some
on and
look so you basically just want to keep
rubbing and rubbing and rubbing hoping
that it comes off all right so I
actually poured a bunch of the rubbing
alcohol onto here and it's actually
getting a lot looser it's getting a lot
better so now I've been taking the spoon
and just like doing this and it's
getting a lot
looser it's definitely coming
off so now I'm going to try and I
actually forgot to mention earlier get a
washcloth I'm going to dip it into this
the
water with the
soap yeah that piece just came
off now I'm going to try and take the
spoon
again I'm going to pour some
more I'm going to try and like go with
the alcohol and the spoon put the whole
thing in the water I'm going to put some
stain remover and some water on through
it so I've officially gotten all the
Slime off the carpet so I'm taking some
Pap
towels dry the caret
off now
basically if you had
white clear slime this wouldn't be there
but since I had colored slime it's going
to leave a stain so I'm going to take my
stain remover so now I have that and
take another paper
towel and the
too and basically now I'm just going to
continuously put stain remover and water
on this and hope that it comes out all
right so I have been working really hard
on this and so far this is what I have
which I'm not done I have taken this and
I basically I'm going to do it again
sprink good I have basically drowned
this whole
caret and rubbing
alcohol so now I'm just going to let it
sit for like a long time like 2 Hour 2
hours or something like that and I'm
going to come back and check out how
it's
done so it's been like 2 or 3 hours
because I actually went to the store and
I got a bunch of stuff so now I'm going
to check on the
thing
you can definitely tell that it has gone
away a
lot like a
lot so basically this is going to be the
final thing that I'm going to do I'm
just going to put some water on it to
make the alcohol go away and then dry it
off and so that's basically how to do it
now I know it's not probably what
everybody was really hoping for but it's
still how you do it and it's the best
that I can get
people can probably get a lot better but
that's just what I'm
doing all right so I've had this towel
on it for like a few hours or maybe even
1 hour just soaking it in
and you barely if even know something
was there so yeah it definitely
works hope you like it so I'm going to
be posting every other day I post on
Sunday Tuesday
Thursday and
Saturday so yeah that's what I'm
doing bye
guys
for
bye guys
