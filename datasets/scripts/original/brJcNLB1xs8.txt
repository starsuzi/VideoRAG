hey welcome to this tutorial where I'm
going to show you how to create this 3D
coin flip inside of After Effects so the
first thing you want to do is select
your default renderer as Cinema 4D while
creating a new composition and then
let's create a background and lock
it now let's create a circle let's
duplicate the ellipse inside the circle
and resize it this one needs to have a
[Music]
stroke
[Music]
now let's make the layer 3D and switch
to a custom
view now the geometry options here is
only enabled when you select your
default renderer Cinema
4D so let's extrude our
shape maybe add in a bevel to the
edges now if you rotate this coin you'll
find that the other side of the coin
does not have the
circle so we fix that that by
duplicating the smaller ellipse and
placing it right below the bigger
[Music]
one now let's switch back to our active
View and create the dollar sign on top
of the
[Music]
coin do a top view and create a copy on
the other side of the
coin
[Music]
now let's go to the back view and fix
the dollar sign by flipping it
[Music]
horizontally now let's parent our dollar
symbols to the
coin
and let's maybe shy those
layers now let's set key frames for
position and rotation and let's
[Music]
animated
[Music]
add some easing and drag the graph to
the left that way it comes in Fast and
then
[Music]
slow and we get this now let's
precompose all of this into a
composition and duplicate
[Music]
it
[Music]
and that's it make sure you check out
the free project file feel free to use
it any of your projects and thanks for
[Music]
