all right so the question here is does
WD40 remove tar now I just discovered
this on YouTube from a bunch of other
videos but I wanted to do it myself and
see if it actually worked cuz this tar
had been sitting on the car for quite a
while now and it actually some of it
came off just from washing the car but I
really need to get this off before it's
too late so I'm going to spray some on
and we'll see what happens
[Music]
just going to go ahead and wipe some of
the excess off and see if it'll
actually comes off pretty
nicely all right so it's been about
maybe 7 or 8 minutes and I'm going to
take a look to see if this actually
worked now I while I wasn't filming I
took my nail and just picked at some of
the lines here and it
literally just chips right off off it's
kind of amazing so you can see on my
nail
there that some came
off so it's really really not that hard
so I took the dirtiest towel I
had let's try to wipe it okay and it
doesn't work thought it worked
um might need to just do this several
times over I will say it didn't it did
loosen
it because some stuff that was never
moving is now
moving so for this tar I mean I've seen
I watched other YouTubers do
it but this is an unsuccessful
attempt kind of like me trying to talk
to a girl ever
just
no ah all right well yeah I mean some of
it's coming off but I guess this is I
guess it's a process to do this several
times it is
helping yeah see some pieces are
breaking off it's it's better than
anything else that I've done I'll say
that but uh it's not don't expect it to
just don't expect the tar to just start
falling off your car that's for sure not
going to happen it just uh it does
loosen it though
so does it work kind of but it's not a
magic solution that you're going to do
one wipe and it's all gone so just uh
keep that in mind
well thank you for watching this short
video um plenty more videos to come on
my Focus ST and little tricks like this
that I learn and can give you just kind
of a realistic sense of if they actually
work uh thanks for watching and we'll
see you soon
