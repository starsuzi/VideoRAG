hi I'm Blair Gilbert here for MRH
hardware.com And Gilberts Pro Hardware
in St clar Shores we are here to show
the the puppy poop
[Music]
hole how easy they are to make how great
they are to maintain and how with a
bigger dog I used to have a 70b dog
these poop holes would last me a year
and a
half
so here's Finn's puppy poophole go to
your local landscape
yard find yourself the center of a
circle kit these are my brick
pavers this is the bricks for the
center of a circle
kit I took Franklin heavyduty
construction adhesive this glue lasts
typically over 10 years before finally
get a a break in my bricks I do is I put
a healthy Gob on each joint all the way
around the
circle I put the circle together I get
it all kind of
nice I put a rope around it I tie it
around to stick and I tighten it like a
tourniquet I tighten it overnight I glue
it in a piece of cardboard so any glues
is out here's the reason we do this the
killer fin
we've had these holes have dotted around
the perimeter of my property here uh
since the 80s each time I move them I'll
take and I'll take the ring sometimes
these have been out in the lawn I will
take the ring and put it over the
grass Notch the
grass cut the side off then when I dig
the hole I put the dirt over the old
hole which you're about to see and then
I can put the side back over the old
Hole in A month's time you can't even
see where the old holes have been the
grass fills in and now I'm on the new
poop hole so here's the
procedure see how well that glue has
lasted
this unit is staying in the garden so
there's no side involved but you can see
if you were in a side situation this
would not be a very big deal just to cut
the side the same way is I'm going to
remove a little of the
Earth so I removed the
perimeter so that the bricks will be
about
flush I'm using a post toll Digger to
start my initial
hole and my goal here is to go as deep
as I possibly can and I'm going to egg
shape the hole a little bit and the plan
here is so when I put the bricks back
the bricks will be about flush with the
surface around it I don't need them to
be proud to be tripped on I try to keep
them flush I've got these in my lawn at
home that are right in the yard the
lawnmower goes right over it when I
start the
hole the first dirt I use is to cover up
the old hole now that I have sufficient
dirt on top of the old can tamper down
and all evidence of the old hole will be
gone as soon as something starts to grow
there these are my steel to sandals by
the way fully OSHA approved I try to
make this hole 2 and 1/2 ft deep 3T deep
I go down at an
angle my goal is to pear shape this hole
so it's bigger at the bottom now I got a
20 lb dog this hole probably lasts two
years and it's only uh 2T deep so bear
in mind the
ground how much energy you have how big
your dog is Will control the size of
your hole one more thing to think about
is cuz if you're doing this in any part
of your yard where there could be
underground utilities gas lines uh water
lines or sprinkler lines dig this hole
gingerly or to be totally safe you can
call Miss Dig and it will come out and
identify all the lines in your yard so
before you're digging you don't go find
anything that you shouldn't have with
your shovel holes
dug the lips been
made what really makes the system
cool as I go get a hunk of slate to
slide over the
hole I take and I can just kick the
brick aside throw the waist in the hole
put the brick back over the
top and now got a natural composting
puppy poop hole you can't even see where
the old hole
was ready for some plant life in a
little
while and the garden continues
on puppy maintenance Made Easy thanks to
