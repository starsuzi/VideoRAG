hello youtubers back up at the plot it's
going to be a quick one today because
i'm going to give you a quick
tour of the plot and i'm up here mainly
to
pick stuff so i'm going to be picking
broad beans
gooseberries um i'm going to be pointing
up my onions
and gloating i'm gonna show you um
my giant sunflower which is two foot
tall
i am gonna be picking some potatoes
i
do you pick potatoes like i said i'm
going to be digging up some potatoes
everybody on youtube seems to be doing
the potato reveal
it's my turn now to steal the glory
brendan bacon soda
i don't think so pal you're going to be
green with envy when you see the crop
i've got up there
they are doing fantastic let me take you
up there now
now i don't mean to brag but look at
this for a healthy crop of potatoes
don't be fooled by their dry exterior
these potatoes were watered at least
once every two months
so if you want award-winning potatoes
like this go back and check one of my
previous videos when i planted these and
you too could get
results like these okay let's do a
potato reveal
exciting times
okay for anybody even remotely
interested in the variety of potatoes
that i've grown here
these are the charlotte's like i said i
made a video of them
planting them earlier on in the year and
as you can see
they've come up trumps the plants look
really well
let's do a potato reveal
so far so good
ah now
how about those
there's another
not too bad look at the eyes
they got that purple color
nice eyeliner purple eyeliner for these
potatoes
let's get digging some more up
there you go one i've just stabbed
couple more
ah there's the old seed potato i won't
be eating that
come on potatoes where are you
well none there
let's try here
some more it's all happening
it's exciting times like i've said
before
jesus i almost him
let's carry on
ah there's one
do you know what considering i thought
my potato plants had died
and i wasn't gonna get a single thing
that's not a bad haul from
some pretty ropey plants um i'm gonna
dig up a couple more actually because
uh i want them to last me the week so
i'll pause for a moment i'll come back
to you when i'm picking some raw beans
those are the charlotte's from this row
here
probably picked two thirds of the row
oh there i am hello
so row one has produced that amount of
spuds
charlotte like i said and i've got
all these rows to go
don't mind the weeds so that's another
nine rows there
hello mr spinach and a row
there so i'm happy with that
let's get out the broad beans
not bad
that'll do for broad beans
and now for the gooseberries
i inherited this bush i'm not a big fan
of gooseberries
but i am of these because these are the
dessert type the red ones
i've had the green ones before and like
i said i just wasn't a fan
very sour whereas these
to my surprise are very
sweet ow
and thorny
can you get that
don't do me
there's a sunflower plant he's looking
happy
it's the best i've ever done when it
comes to uh growing these
let me just show you these
that one there that's aaron
that's a lot mental
it's brendan bacon soda right there
chris
that one there is dan otherwise known as
scissor later
ian knockton
rickman man
who else we got far in there that's
shawn james cameron
and finally that's tony
right there
nobody can tell me i don't know my
onions
so here are french climbing beans
finally coming on can you see those get
them out with shadows
squash butternut squash finally making
some headway
i'll be picking these in about a week
the leeks tremendous considering they
were just so tiny when i put them in
spinach really happy with that i'll be
picking that as well
and that's the rest of the plot
undercover
and under weeds that was a quick whistle
stop tour of the plot
on a glorious day in mid-june
and i'm really pleased with the spuds
that i've dug up i didn't expect them to
be as good as that to be honest
right what i have learned since i've
been coming up here and making these
videos
is that garden knowledge doesn't really
count for anything as far as i'm
concerned
you know you can have all the knowledge
on earth
but when it comes to uh mother nature
she knows best but what i do think is
really
really important and that every good
gardener
should have is a pair of these
yep that's right some fabulous footwear
can you see these this is what i wear
every time i come out to replot
even old mother hubbard wouldn't want to
live in there she's long vacated
right so that's my right shoe
there we go
here's the left always have a good chat
with him
so fashionistas out there get yourself a
pair of these
they will literally take you places
today
it's the allotment tomorrow who knows it
could be 10 downing street
bye
you
