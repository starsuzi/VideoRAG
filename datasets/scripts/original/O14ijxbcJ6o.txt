okay this is a Lark's head knot this is
the most basic knot um that you use to
attach um the cords so what you're going
to do is fold the cord in half this is
dead center and then you're going to
throw over your
dowel and then pull the
two tail ends
through okay I'm going to squeeze that
to the center and I'll show you one
more so you take the center of the Rope
throw it
over grab that Loop and then pull the
two tails of the Rope through and then
just tighten it up
