okay there's a problem with the washing
machine on rinse
cycle which we have it set here the
water only barely trickles out see
that that's not
normal so what I'm going to do is show
you what I've learned and how any one
can fix
this it's pretty
simple and um this video will review
that anybody can do this with just
simple hand
tools the first obvious thing to check
is to make sure the water hasn't been
cut
off if the water has not been uh cut off
or turned any then the next step is to
check your hoses make sure the hoses
have not been kinked I have stainless
steel hoses on my washing machine
because there has been numerous
incidences of these hoses
exploding and getting water all over the
house which can lead to disaster so I
have stainless coating on my
hoses okay so if your hoses are not um
kinked then the next step is
to check out the filter and I'll show
you these are tools that I'm using to
make this repair and um these are what's
called needlenose pliers you get those
at any hardware store even uh Walmart
has these and these are uh brand name
called channel locks and there's just
some uh adjustable pliers you can
probably get by without having these but
um I use I use these to loosen my lines
here because they're pretty they're
fairly tight
but you could probably do that with a
pair of regular
pliers okay so what we're going to do
we're going to start out with the cold
water I know it's the cold water because
um the hot water actually rinses fine
but when you place it on rinse with
cold the cold water is impaired the flow
is impaired
so what I'm going to do is undo this
line right here this is the cold water
and I've traced it back to the cold
water supply
okay there will be some there will be
some
dripping so I'm going to place a bucket
under the
[Music]
connection
okay then after you break loosen it with
your pliers you can then just simply use
your fingers to undo this like a water
hze now
to keep water from draining all over
your house with this
hose what you can do is just
simply put it right there cuz this is a
drain um that
comes with your plumbing
supply
so okay have the uh cold water hose off
and this is the male end of that that's
connected to the fridge I mean to the uh
to the washing machine and you can see
it has a little C here for coal
now there is a little
filter inside of there and I'm hoping I
can show that to
you right inside there that it's not
uncommon for them to get stocked up so
what I'm going to do is reach inside
there with my needlenose pliers and pull
that
out now I just pulled the filter
out and I wanted to show you how
horrible this thing looks I don't know
if this little camera can pick it up but
there is uh
basically an
accumulation of debris on this little
filter and the whole purpose of this
little filter is to protect your um your
solenoid that turns the water on it off
also when I pulled it out you can see at
the bottom of the bucket there's this
brown
goop that had totally
included the uh cold water supply to the
washing
machine so I hope you're able to see
this but just know that these little
tiny filters can get very uh stopped
stopped
up and so therefore your water supply
will be
limited the uh screen is now cleaned and
I'm going to put it back into the um
male end of the washing machine and it
goes in like this with the bowl in
facing inward
okay if that makes sense goes in
like
this and maybe you can see in there
okay after you have your screen in
reconnect your water
supply tighten it by hand first and then
just apply just a little bit of
pressure tur it about a quter of a
turn and then be sure this doesn't leak
by cutting your your water supply back
on
okay after you cut your water supply on
just F down here to make sure there's no
water coming from the
connection okay and there is
none so
now let's test this thing and make sure
it works turn it to rinse
see ah yeah now that's what a rinse
cycle should look
like
okay hey we just fixed this uh washing
machine took probably
uh 10 minutes and really the only tool
that you need to have is a pair of
needlenose pliers so that you can reach
in and grab the screen and pull it
out
so hope this helps you and good luck
with your washing machine rent cycle
problem thank you
