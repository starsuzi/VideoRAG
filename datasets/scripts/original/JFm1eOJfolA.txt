hey this is Sarah from politically
incorrectthealth.com today I'm going to
show you how to make sour cream or creme
fraiche
now creme fraiche is enjoyed as a
condiment in Europe and North American
Cuisine
today we're going to make it from raw
cream
and so why would we want to make it from
raw cream
and make a raw sour cream because
the vitamin B6
is available and when you start cooking
it
then you start to lose the nutrients and
vitamin B6 is one of those nutrients and
raw milk that you start to lose
sour cream is also a fermented food so
it's good for digestion
it also balances the good and bad
bacteria in your gut
there is also lactose that is being
broken down in the fermentation process
so it can be enjoyed on the gas side
also if you have any raw cream that is
going bad in your refrigerator you don't
have to throw it away you can start to
make sour cream from it
now if you have pasteurized cream that
is going bad you don't want to use that
you do want to throw it away because
it's not safe to drink
so what I have here is a clean sanitized
mason jar
two cups of raw grass-fed cream
right here I have some organic Whole
Foods sour cream I don't have any
previous sour cream made or any
buttermilk you can use buttermilk or
sour cream interchangeably for this
recipe
some people use one tablespoon for two
cups or even up to three I'm gonna use
probably about a half cup it's going to
make a little more
make it a little bit thicker too
all right so we're going to mix it all
together

you do not want to cover it with the lid
that comes with the Mason jar because it
needs to be able to breathe
so I'm going to cover it with a clean
towel
and secure it with the rubber band
I'm going to put it right by the stove
because that's the worst place in the
kitchen
and in order for it to really ferment
and grow it needs to be in a warm place
so we're going to let it sit here for 24
hours we're going to come back and I'm
going to show you what it looks like
and we're back
it's been a little over 24 hours
the
sour cream has been fermenting
on my counter and it's been somewhat
warm
and as you can see it's very thick now
just the way that sour cream should be
and um
we're just gonna
put the lid on it
and once you put it in the fridge it's
going to thicken up even more
and that's how you make sour
