good morning so if you ever wanted to
remove this ugly white calcium deposit
off of your
block fence it's a very simple process
don't bother with scrubbing
with steel wool or any other type of
cleaner
don't use any cleaners on this the
fastest easiest way
is just to boil some water and pour it
directly
onto the white calcium you may have to
do this several times
i've already done this twice waited a
day
and now i'm doing it again let's give it
a try
that was a pigeon i'll make other videos
showing you how to remove pigeons
anyway you just pour this on there
like this i don't have a big enough
bucket to cover it all
excuse the shadow there but that's me
i'm holding my phone
go wait a little bit i'll hit this again
you may have to take another try
but after a while it will come totally
off and you have a nice clean
fence again thanks for watching
