Hello everyone it is Barry here welcome to
my virgin kitchen hope you are well todays
recipe is requested by Raquel Carrion she
left me a comment on my video last night and
I thought that sounds amazing an apple and
cinnamon crumble so without further ado the
ingredients are right here lets get going
ok so we start off with the crumble topping
massive bowl here first thing we do is get
the plain flour in there no need to sieve
it we will work it with the hands in just
a jiffy this is some muscavado sugar you can
use light brown sugar if you do not have that
shot of cinnamon oh yes and of course using
the mini grater I was sent this is some nutmeg
so just grate it then mix it in with clean
hands because it is going to get messy now
folks we add in some cubed butter this is
some butter I have chopped up in little squares
looks a bit like cheese plonk that all in
and there is nothing better than getting your
fingers and thumbs in there rubbing it all
together with our chilled butter until it
becomes a nice crumble topping.
There we are lovely cinnamon flavour it smells
so good crumble topping.
So for the apple filling these are seven bramley
apples that I chopped in chunks they have
been peeled and cored it has been sat in lemon
water to stop it changing colour but I just
drained it off so what we do is add in some
more light brown sugar just going to dump
it on top as it looks awesome, these are some
raisins this is optional but love the apple
and raisin combo of course as Raquel requested
Raquel requests love that like a tv show cinnamon
on top any excuse to use the mini nutmeg grater
again so some more nutmeg and a cheeky drizzle
of honey about a heaped teaspoon loving it
all we need to do is bring those ingredients
together use hands if you are feeling really
kinky but I am just going to use a spatula
work it round steady just to make it coat
all those apples and it will smell amazing.
Ok so we have those lovely stained apple and
raisins right there I cannot get over how
amazing that smells and also our crumble topping
sat patiently there this is an ovenproof buttered
dish so let them all join together by shoving
in the apple mixture.
So good see the residue at the bottom it is
full of flavour the cinnamon nutmeg and honey
push this in there and flatten with a spatula
get a nice spread.
Alrighty so we grab our crumble topping and
sprinkle it all on top oh my gosh that is
such an amazing moment I am feeling as one
with this crumble I can not get over the amazing
smell in here now the cinnamon and apple the
caramelisation that happens when it goes in
the oven once it is all topped to your liking
that is exactly what is going to happen we
bake it in the oven for 30 minutes.
Lets see what it comes out like, ok that has
been 35 minutes check out the bubbling in
there that is extremely hot caramelisation
going on we will take it out the oven let
it cool for ten minutes and serve.
So it has cooled down but still nice and warm
all we do is get a big old spoon carve out
a nice massive portion of that serve it up
and of course drench it with some lovely custard
I cannot wait to taste this looking stonking
and smelling great.
I am so excited to try this one and like Raquel
