I'm going to show you how to do a garden edging
around the tree.
The tools are in need are a hammer, plastic
pegs, hex saw for cutting the edging, also
I need a shovel.
The reason why we are creating an edging for
this tree is I had giving a little bit of
space, a little bit of room to move, also
to keep the lawn away because it's going to
be a competitor in terms of root space for
the tree.
The first thing that we need to do is remove
the concrete tray ring.
It's quite easy to pop this up but i would
need a colleague to help me lift it because
it's quite heavy.
I'm now just going to dig a little bit further
around the tree before I actually lay up the
edging.
I'm happy with my trench, now all I have to
do is rolled it out, measure it, and cut it.
This is not the right length and I'm just
going to cut it with the hex saw.
Now it's time to peg it.
I always peg with joint is first, hold it
in place, and then just work while evenly
around maybe put about four pegs in a length
like this.
I'm going to leave this edging just that little
bit higher so that you can't use as a mowing
strip around it.
All that's left now is to backfill it, clean
it up.
And once it's back filled, the lawn will grow
up to the edge and that will really make the
job neat and tidy.
If you want to, you can put some mulch around
the tree.
Once the grass grows around the edging there
it will look very neat and tidy.
And that's how you install garden edging around
the tree.
