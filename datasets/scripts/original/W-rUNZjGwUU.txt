I put these in on Friday evening it's
now Sunday afternoon so let's take a
look
here at the little guy in the
electrolysis
bath has a lot of carbon stuff coming
off
there okay here's the one in the
vinegar yeah I'm going to get a glove on
before I get that
out not too
bad I'll get it cleaned up and see how
it looks well look at this
one this is the one that was in the
vinegar bath and cleaned up pretty nice
the rust anyway I took the wire wheel to
it
and it uh it made quick work of the rust
the carbon buildup on it is still a
little tough to break through so I might
let this sit for another day in the
vinegar I'm going to put it in uh bottom
sides
up and I don't think the vinegar
penetrated this cuz it was sitting on
this so we I'll flip it over and I'll
let it soak for another couple
days my conclusion so far
bar vinegar works really well if you
have some just rusty
pieces I might just throw this Wagner
one in some vinegar cuz it's just rust
there's not it doesn't seem like there's
a lot of carbon build up I don't know
yet this one in electrolysis tank is
just look at all that carbon flaking off
it looks tasty doesn't
it I'm going to go hit this one with the
hose and I'll come back and uh we'll
take a look well there's that
one power blasted with the
hose so I think for
carbon um so far you can't beat the
electrolysis for the amount of time that
it's
SAT but this does look pretty good from
all that rust that was in there there's
a little bit
of little bit of pitting down in here
but you get it seasoned up and it'll
work good all right got this car all the
carbon off of this one and it looks
shiny
and this one's going back to
sit we might have to end up
electrolyzing this one
electrolyzing is that a word might have
to end up putting this back in
electrolysis to get that carbon
off well this one's been in the vinegar
bath for about 2 and a half days
now and you can just see
how that really cleaned up the uh rust
on that thing
however the vinegar doesn't seem like it
could break through the uh the
carbonized
scale on this side
so I am going to have to uh if I want to
get this completely clean I'm just going
to have to
electrolysis it probably this one is one
that was in the electrolysis tank and
they had all that Carbon on there and
it's now seasoned it's been seasoned
three times in the oven and uh it's nice
and smooth and shiny and ready to
go conclusions I think that vinegar is
an
excellent uh choice if you just have a
rusty pan and I've seen people get
results with vinegar in 3 or 4 hours and
of course the longer you let it go just
you know probably the more cleaning
it'll it'll guarantee it uh as far as
the rust goes if you have any type of
scale or carbon buildup though you
probably are going to have to do an
electrolysis
tank there's a couple other methods that
people have talked about which I haven't
tried yet such as a uh building a big
fire putting the pans directly in the in
the fire and basically getting them red
hot it's the same thing you can do with
a selfcleaning oven um if you have a
self-cleaning oven that gets up to
around 900 or
1,000Â° uh you can put these in there and
try to bake some of that some of that
off so I'd say vinegar is definitely a
good good option and and um of course
the electrolysis tank works good too
well that's about it thanks for watching
guys I don't know to get that hard
carbon off you just can't beat the
electrolysis
tank this stuff's going to flake right
off with the hose
