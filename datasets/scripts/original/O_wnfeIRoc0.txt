Okay guys.
Next up on our list we have the Duck Fart,
also sometimes known as the Mad Cow.
So for all you mad shot drinkers out there,
this is the shot for you.
We've got a simple shot for you here, but
don't let the name fool you.
This is a strong shot.
So we're going to start off with a shaker
and a little bit of ice, and we're going to
use our old trusty dusty friend 151.
Yes that's right sports fans this is not for
the weak of heart.
Full one and a half ounce pour of your trusty
151.
Run to your neighborhood park, grab a duck,
and squeeze your duck into your glass.
Don't worry.
It doesn't smell as bad as it sounds, but
you shake it all together.
You throw it into your glass, you can insert
your whoopee cushion noise here if you choose
to, but let me tell you that usually works
to pick up the ladies.
That's okay, enjoy yourself a fine and wonderful
Duck Fart.
