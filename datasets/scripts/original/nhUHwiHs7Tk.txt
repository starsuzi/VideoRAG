hello everyone i'm going to show you how
to set up a red trapdoor spider
these guys are from africa they do like
it a little warmer um
i they're a burrowing spider so keep
them in a warm spot in your house
usually anywhere from 70 to 80 room
temperature-ish kind of
[Music]
they do need a lot of dirt they do uh
this one's mine from home
mine's already been burrowing he's got a
little hole going in there and down to
the bottom
you probably want like usually five to
seven inches of dirt in your container
they don't like large spaces so keeping
them in a small critter keeper is
usually recommended um
what i use at mine is i use plantation
soil as usually the base to keep a bunch
of it you know build it up
this you just put in water it expands
and it keeps nice and moist what i do is
i mix mine with vermiculite and wrapped
sands
this is so that it does keep moisture
and it keeps hard so when they make
their burrows they don't collapse onto
them with just using normal dirt usually
it will collapse and then they can't
make their cute little girls like they
do um
so
normally um like i said use the
phonariums extra terrifying earrings
work perfect
fill it up almost all the way to the top
like you can see i have here almost the
entire thing is is filled um they spend
most of their time under
underground so it's not going to matter
if you leave a lot of room at the top or
anything come on
just so it looks good in my home
i've used just a little piece of green
so it looks nice
at the top too i like to keep a little
bit of cypress mulch in there because
i've noticed with a lot of my trapdoors
what they'll do is they'll make their
doors with this
when you first make it what you want to
do is you want to keep the the bedding
kind of moist
that way they can burrow a little bit
better and you don't ever want to have
it super dry because you don't want it
to collapse on them
when you first make it build it up and
then take your finger and make a little
hole in in the top of it they'll use
that hole to make their burrows if you
don't make that hole
usually it takes them a lot longer to
kind of figure out what they're going to
do and whatnot
in the wild they do take over burrows
from other animals and and things like
that so that's why you want to make the
hole with your finger so that way they
can take it over and kind of do their
own thing make their tunnels and whatnot
i also have a little exoterra
invertebrate dish in there they don't
usually drink water out of a dish
they'll drink it from when whatever you
spray in there so misting them probably
once every couple days is a good idea um
this is good because it has a sponge in
there they can't drown or anything like
that um but just in case they are extra
thirsty i keep that in there so that
they can get their water
and whatnot so since these guys like to
live in burrows um the cool thing that
we do have on our website is by pet tech
it's called a small burrow
they can fit in the i think these are
large critter keepers uh they fit right
in the front and what you'll do is
you'll just uh basically fill this over
with dirt and then make your little hole
right up here where the this hole goes
down so that way when they go in there
they can make their little
little burrows in there and you can see
them because if you don't uh most of the
time you're not going to be able to see
them unless
you get lucky enough that they make
their burrow going through the front of
your container but these are awesome and
i highly highly suggest them for
anything that's burrowed
i just wanted to show everyone how cute
these little guys are when they're
actually out um they are very very
fierce but they're so adorable and
they're cute little little little legs
there come here come here it's okay
just look at me
see they're just adorable look at that
smiling little face in there this guy's
getting ready to ship today that's why
we've got him in this little cup that
way he can't be thrown around anywhere
um he is eating right now uh he can eat
large crickets they may be small but
they can eat big things
the cool thing about them too is when
they're eating uh what they'll do is you
won't see anything you'll just kind of
see their door once the prey item goes
past their door they'll just open it up
grab it and pull it back in and that's
all you'll see of them but it's super
cool to watch if you get a chance to
actually see them eat but they can eat
anything like crickets roaches
super worms anything that really crosses
that path they're going to eat it
