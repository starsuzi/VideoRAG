hey guys so today I'm going to show you
how I like to make an amoretto sour so
we start with a lemon and a
lime and I'm just going to cut those in
half and then juice
them for my Amor sour I like to use one
whole lemon and then half of the
lime so this ends up making a pretty
sour Amoro sour um if you guys like it a
little more sweet or less sour you don't
have to put this much lemon juice
in okay and then we want to add one chot
glass full of simple
syrup and now what you want to do is
separate an egg into the White and the
yolk and so I like to add egg whites
into my amoros sour cuz it makes them a
little bit thicker it gives them a
little bit more body and it makes for
them to be a little bit frothier
okay so now we add one shot of
amoretto and I'm adding a little extra
cuz that other shot wasn't really
full add a few ice cubes to the glass
and then we want to shake for 1 minute
it's really important that we shake it
pretty vigorously for this 1 minute cuz
otherwise it'll end up with some snotty
like egg white stuff still in your drink
um so we want to make sure it gets nice
and th frothy and that egg white gets
really mixed up in
there now we pour our drink into a glass
full of
ice and then top with a
cherry if you liked this video remember
