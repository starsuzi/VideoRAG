hi everyone and welcome back to my
Channel today Noah and I are going to be
making Anzac biscuits today is actually
Anzac Day well the day that we're
filming this anyway and Anzac stands for
Australia New Zealand's Army cool yes
and Anzac biscuits were believed have
been sent to the soldiers on the front
by the women back home because they
lasted long in the post without going
off yeah and they held up well in the
mail and they were also sold at Fates
and garas to raise money for the war
effort
so if you want to know how to make them
then just keep
watching so what you're going to need is
one cup of flour one cup of sugar one
cup of coconut two cups of roll
oats
um here half a cup half a cup of butter
and two tablespoons of golden syrup
and we've got te one teaspoon of baking
soda dissolved into three tablespoons of
hot water okay so the first thing we
want to do is melt the butter and the
golden syrup together if you don't have
golden syrup you can use
honey so you can melt it in the
microwave or on the stove we're just
going to do it in the microwave so how
long will it take maybe a minute minute
and a half but we'll check it and stir
it during that time so we've got our
melted butter and syrup that took a
minute and 10 seconds so now what we
want to do is dump all of the dry
ingredients in together so we going to
do that now going to do
that so
flour
sugar
coconut and oats do you want to give
that a mix
okay you can use a mixer but right now
we're using a wooden
spoon last time when I did this at
school I spill
everywhere okay so let mixed up okay
when that's all mixed up then you want
to make a little well in the
middle and you'll add your baking soda
needs a little bit of a
mix in your melted butter and
syrup and then tip that into the
well a little
bit smells like pokey
pokey smells good doesn't it
yeah this is I think this is going to
turn out good I hope so and then you mix
that all up mix it up have you ever done
this before a similar recipe I haven't
it gets all gooey and hard kind of you
need me to have it go
okay that's okay it you the most of the
work for me it should be all gooey in
kind of creamy not
cream Chun chunky kind
of so we finished mixing it now now it's
time to get our hands dir okay so we
have our sheet
cookie and I've just lined it with
baking poer so I'm using my scoop just
so that the biscuits are even sizes can
I get a scoop here you go you you know
what to do with it I don't know what to
do with it kind of Squish them into
little balls okay and flatten them
[Music]
B one anyway that's okay I I like making
it really flat because then it'll like
long and good yeah you can just squish
the little sticky ay bits into it that
they don't
burn so suppose we could just squeeze it
onto the cookie sheet hey oh this is a
big one what the fun using a scoop baby
be I'm a bigger how about we just scoop
them out and then we squish them yeah
you do Scoopy I'll do the
[Music]
squishing so you want to gather up any
of the um bits of oats and coconut
that's fallen off and squish them onto
one of the cookies because they will
burn
otherwise how you going there you see
you just squish all the edges
in just like here yeah I think you're
doing a good
job I love B it's
good so now we've just about finished
our first load bch and they're going
into the oven you want to heat your oven
to 325 F or 180 C and they'll go in for
12 to 15 minutes just keep an eye on
them when they start going gold golden
they're ready to come out you don't want
them to burn so just keep an eye so they
don't
sing this is how the cookies will look
when they are ready to come out of the
oven nice and golden brown and you'll
leave them on the cookie sheet to cool
for a little bit and set up and then you
can put them onto a cooling
rack I hope you enjoyed that and if you
