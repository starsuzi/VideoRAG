hello all I'm back again um I'm doing a
bit of sewing now and what I've what I'm
sewing today is some Hol
Oaks and uh I've grown these several
ways in the
past um well I say in several ways I've
done I've grown them once before um but
what we're doing this time I'm following
the instructions of somebody else uh
person a company who actually grows them
and what they're saying is that prepare
a a uh seed tray like
this um water the
soil and then place the seeds equally
apart now what I've done is I've put
these
roughly well they vary a bit but the
first lot's about inch and a/ qu inch
and a half
apart and I've moved on and I've spread
these a little further apart
part and basically what I'm going to do
now sprinkle them with soil I'm going to
put the um propagator tops over these
plastic tops here and uh keep them moist
and uh we'll see how they go it should
be in a week or two they should be
through apparently at this stage you can
cover them up um they don't need light
to germinate but as soon as they're
through then they do obviously need
light and they prefer a Sunny Spot now
it's spring now um I don't expect to get
for these plant flowers to uh produce
flowers this year it' be highly
unlikely um so I'm basically growing for
next year and obviously once these are
are thr and they're big enough I will
then transplant them into
pots um I don't know whether they'll all
germinate or not um obviously you need
you only need a few in your garden but
uh I do like growing stuff
so really we'll see how it
goes so that's it that's that's today's
sewing um I shall stop this video and uh
we'll give you a little update on how
all the other seeds are growing since
yesterday and
uh things are happening
