okay guys so let's focus on the
seasonings that you're going to be
seasoning your oxtails with you're going
to need some black pepper you're going
to need some ground Jamaican all spice
you're going to need some seasoned salt
if you can't find seasoned salt or you
don't have any you can use salt you're
going to need some onion powder you're
going to need some thme I do recommend
that you go and use fresh thme but if
you can't find fresh th time seasoning
would do just fine and last but not
least garlic
powder so make sure you have all six of
those
seasonings okay folks so now we're going
to focus on the other ingredients you're
going to need for your oxel you're going
to need some wasure sauce you're going
to need some olive oil you're going to
need some beef broth if you don't have
beef broth you can use water cuz we're
going to end up using a little bit of
water
anyway you're going to need some minced
garlic now if you don't have minced
garlic you can chop up a garlic clove
and that'll do the job but I recommend
that you use minced garlic we're going
to be using a little bit of
ketchup and you're going to need some
Browning and seasoning sauce and that's
going to darken the
oxel and towards the end we're going to
be adding our butter
beans now some people like to use Gravy
Master that's a different brand of
Browning and seasoning sauce so you can
use this kind
here or you can use the grav
master I don't know which one is better
I always use this one here but if you
don't have that I guess you can use this
one grey master I guess it's the same
thing but I'm going to use this brand
today since this is what I'm used to
using all right okay and I'm also going
to be using some iodized
salt I'm going to sprinkle this on my
oxbs I'm going to be using this along
with water to clean the oxbs I'm going
to soak the oxs in salt water solution
for about a half an hour rub them
together really really well and get the
residue off of the oxil so make sure you
have some salt as well to clean the oxil
if you don't have salt you can use
vinegar or lemon juice lemon juice and
water vinegar and water or salt and
water but if you don't have salt vinegar
and lemon juice you can use as a substit
okay guys so we're going to be using
some
vegetables we're going to be putting
some vegetables in our oxtails you're
going to need a tomato tomato if you
don't want to chop up a tomato just get
a can of already diced tomatoes you're
going to be using some bell peppers you
can just get one green bell pepper the
only reason why I'm using different
colors is for decoration
purposes I'm going to be using some
scallions some celery and you're going
to need one large onion so make sure you
have that one large onion celery
scallions a tomato and some bell peppers
all right so make sure you have all of
those vegetables a lot of people like to
use carrots you can add some carrots as
well but I'm not going to be adding any
carrots today these are just the
vegetables I'm going to use I don't
usually put carrots in my oxtails anyway
so make sure you have all of those
vegetables
okay guys so what we're going to do is
we're going to clean our
oxtails so we're going to place the
oxtails in this pot
here
we're going to sprinkle some salt on
them we're going to let these soak in
water for
about a half an
hour I recommend that you guys go out
and try to find some bigger IU
I couldn't find no real thick big ones
I'm a little mad about
that but a lot of you were requesting
that I do a video on how to
make Jamaican style
oxtails
so I just got what I could
find but you're going to rub these
together like
that
rub them really well together like
this get all that residue off of
it and just let them soak in the salt
water for about a half an
hour then we're going to rinse them off
and move on to the next
step okay guys so now what we're going
to do is we're going to cut our peppers
and I'm going to show you how to cut the
bell peppers even though most of you
already know but for those of you who
don't know I'm only going to be using
about half of
each not going to use many peppers at
all going to get this out of it
obviously so I'm going to slice it this
way peel that part out
out slice the peppers down that way like
that slice it the long way like
that then I'm going to turn them around
slice them this
way cut them into small pieces like this
if you have a chopper or a
processor you can chop your peppers up
that way to get them pretty small
it's going to be sort of like a paste
but not
quite okay so you want your that's how
you
chop your peppers like
that so I'm going to chop the yellow one
and the orange
one okay guys so we cut up our
multicolor bell peppers now what we're
going to do is we're going to cut cut
our tomato or tomato depend on where
you're
from and I'm only going to be
using half of this
tomato cut that down the middle there
just like that
there and I'm going to dice this into
square
pieces and we going to make the best I
the best Jamaican style oxtails that you
ever tasted in your whole
life don't nobody make Jamaican style
oxtails like Philly boy J
nobody I would pay you to find somebody
that make oxtails like me don't nobody
do it like me I don't care who they
are just not going to taste as good as
mine okay
so I like my tomatoes to be little
chunky I like things nice and chunky by
the
way
so here's the way you want your tomatoes
to
look chop them up to squares like that
you don't put these in the
processor you want them to have some
shape to them and don't they look
colorful guys look really really
colorful so again you're only going to
use half of the tomato or tomato like I
said depending on where you're from
I Like the Way Tomato sound better
actually this is going to be our
vegetable
rainbow here we have our celery I'm not
going to use much celery I am going to
show you guys how to cut it an easier
way one of my subscribers told me about
this slice it down the middle like
that a long way down the middle just
like that right there okay then turn on
this side here like
this you're going to cut it this
way just like
that and I don't use much celery in my
oxil at
all
so you're only going to need about that
much there not going to even cut the
rest of that that's
enough okay guys so now I'm going to get
my
scallions and I'm going to
chop them up to small pieces like this
right
there like
that and what I do actually is I leave
some hold like
that okay so I'm going to move this down
a little bit and I'm going to cut last
but not least our large
onion
if you
don't
like the tears that your onions cost
which I'm sure not many people like or
enjoy that at all what you're going to
do is you're going to sit your free your
onion in the freezer set your onion in
the freezer and cut it in half and I
guess the cold air or the moisture kills
that
uh I don't know if they call it acid or
whatever it is in the onion that causes
us to cry it reduces that significantly
so cut our onions like
this you don't have to cut them too
small because
um all of this is going to
uh shrink
when it
hits the
heat so we have our onions our whole and
chopped scallions our celery our
Tomatoes or tomatoes and we have all our
colorful bell
peppers notice I didn't use a green bell
pepper
because we have green scallions and
celery
shake them really well and rinse them
off all that residue and Funk off the
oxtails you want them to look nice and
clean like that
there course the we're going to season
these bad
boys look real nice and clean don't
they
okay so here are our
oxtails our clean funkless
oxtails got all that funk off and that
residue so we're going to season these
bad boys
now and with my ox I do tend to season
them in a particular order going to show
you guys in a
minute okay guys so we're going to get
our war shaser
sauce
and we're going to sprinkle that on our
oxtails only going to use about 2
tbspoon
worth
okay
we're going to add our Browning and
seasoning
sauce okay about that much
there and that's what's going to give
the oxtail some
color we're going to add a little bit of
ketchup about two tablespoons worth for
ketchup
okay okay we're going to add our minced
garlic
now just a little bit of that about that
much
there
and I'm going to rub all of this
in massage it into the ox
toes
okay
so it should look sort of like that
right
there you guys can smell all that flavor
in the
air from the
oxtails okay
so it should look like that so
far
okay guys so now we're going to season
the ox
sa going to add my seasoned
salt you want to add about 2 tbsp of
season
salt or salt if you don't have seasoned
salt only going to use
about a teaspoon worth of garlic
powder
teaspoon worth of
pepper going to use
about tablespoon worth of all
spice going to use some onion powder
small amount of
that about a teaspoon
worth and our
time I'm only going to use about a
teaspoon wor for that as
well don't use too much time that's
really really
strong and we're going to add some of
our chopped vegetables we're going to
add the rib
Peppers orange and yellow
peppers the celer and
scallions and the
onions for whatever
reason my people used to always add the
tomatoes last for some reason I don't
know why so I only add the tomatoes last
when I add the uh butter
beans okay so I'm going get down and
dirty
again and stick my hands all up in this
and massage it really
well and you're going to
allow your oxtails to marinate in this
season
overnight or for at
least 8 hours the long ER the
better
okay they smell
delicious okay guys so there you go
there go your ax toes
just going to let these marinate
overnight that's how they
look let's get a
closeup let's get a
closeup
okay so we're going to place this
over medium heat so turn it on to about
a five and we're going to
add about 2 tbsps of oil to the pot
we're going to add our
oxtail smells absolutely
wonderful
so so we're going to
add the
vegetables
back
for
e
we're not going to add the beans until
like the last few minutes but I'm going
to add the rest of my scallions and
tomatoes now
so add the
tomatoes and some of the leftover
vegetables that was left in the
bowl mix that in
we going to let this go for about
another hour and a half maybe it should
be done after
that cuz that'll be about
Shoot 5 hours
so you might need to add a little more
water um I had to add a little
more a few minutes ago so
going let this continue
cooking go a little longer I get back
with you
guys and it's time to add the beans
smells really really good though smells
delicious okay guys so the oxtails are
pretty
tender but I'mma let them go for like
another 20
minutes so since this is the last 20
minutes of cooking time I'm going to go
ahead and add the butter
beans I'm going to add them now
