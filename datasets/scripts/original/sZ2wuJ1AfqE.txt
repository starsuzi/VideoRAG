Do you normally wash your chicken before you
cook it?
A study shows that 90% of American housewives
and cooks wash their chicken before cooking.
This may seem harmless, but it actually has
several health risks.
Chicken is extremely rich in proteins, vitamins,
and minerals.
It’s also moist and full of water.
These characteristics provide the perfect
environment for microorganisms to develop,
if the meat isn't conserved and handled in
impeccably clean conditions.
According to scientists at Drexel University,
when we wash chicken in the sink, we might
be contaminating the whole area.
Water can splash off the chicken, up to 20
inches away in any direction.
These splashes of water can carry bacteria,
and may land on clean dishes drying in the
dish drainer, or on nearby food and contaminate
them.
Raw chicken can carry two very common bacteria:
salmonella and campylobacter, which may have
many consequences, from diarrhea to the development
of an autoimmune system disease.
According to several published studies, 47%
of people who wash their chicken are affected
in one way or another by these bacteria.
It’s important to remember that the bacteria
present in raw chicken will be eliminated
when you cook it.
However, if the bacteria is in the sink, it
won't.
This is such a serious subject that two colleges
in the United States started a campaign called
“don't wash your chicken.”
In order to avoid contamination, anytime you
are going to prepare raw foods (vegetables,
beef, chicken or fish), move any food that
is ready to eat or clean dishes away from
that area.
After touching the foods, disinfect the affected
area with hot water.
