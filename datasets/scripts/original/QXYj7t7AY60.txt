Hi, I’m Helen from eSpares. If you notice
that your cooker hood isn’t working properly;
if smoke and smells aren’t being extracted
and grease is building up around the filter,
it’s probably time for a cooker hood MOT.
Generally, there are two types of cooker hood;
one which vents directly to the outside and
one that recirculates the air back into the
kitchen. Make sure you turn off the power
before you open up your cooker hood. I’m
going to leave it on here, just so you can
see what I’m doing. Now, your cooker hood
may look different to this, but they’re
all very simple to open up. This is a recirculating
type of cooker hood. So it just has this big
grease filter here which removes the grease
from the air plus it has this carbon filter
to remove the smells. If you have the type
of cooker hood that vents directly to the
outside you’ll probably only have this grease
filter. This is a fabric type of filter and
needs to be replaced when it becomes saturated
with grease. Your model may have a metal mesh
type filter, if it does that needs to be cleaned
rather than replaced. This FilterKleen is
the perfect product for that and it’s an
eSpares customer favourite. Filters for your
make and model of cooker hood can be found
at the eSpares website. Thanks for watching.
