well as you can
see this is August 17th third day in the
same season and have found a beautiful
Forge probably
about I'd say 20 Ines wide and got about
a 6 seven inch Berry stand full of red
berries and uh my ho is
here it
comes there on my hole that's about 30
30 inches wouldn't you say Lee B of
anyway I wanted to do something today
and uh a lot of my friends has asked me
what's a good how do you plant the seeds
back to try to ensure the growth and
that's what I'm going to do today and I
want to show a way to dig proper when
you find a big mature plant like this
just rake everything back a little bit
and uh what I do is I just reach in
there and I just take my top out now
I've got all my red berries right here
so I can dig safely not knock them
everywhere CU when you start digging
with the berri pot onut you're going to
berries is just going to roll
and uh I like to just make me a little
spot around
it take your your ho or your screwdriver
whatever you did go at least make you a
little circle
pattern this way you'll you'll keep all
the higher roots on your
s and uh and you'll get you'll get to
see your root the way it actually is
instead of chopping it up some people
don't care to chop them up but I like
mine to look good and so does a lot of
people that wants to buy bigger roots
now once I get the ground cut out good
around it I just reach in there and rake
it out start watching for my root to
appear it's important to leave the stock
attached till you get down because if
you don't a lot of times it's you can
run into situations where you can't
hardly find the root
okay see right there's the high
Roots by digging a good wide hole if you
don't care Le get that and help me a
minute bring it over a little bit where
the guy so I've got all that exposed now
I've not broke none of
that and uh I just take one my hand
reach right down in there and just pull
that right out and now now you can see
what a a very nice real nice all the all
the high Roots left on and everything
that's a I'm guessing that probably to
be about an ounce and 3/4 root very nice
big mature that is sweet right there
brother that's a pretty one Ain it yes
it is hard to find we're in the
mountains about two miles high on about
a 10 11 12 graded
pitch and uh that's not easy walking now
what I want to do is I want to show a
proper method of uh planting these
berries back take your hole dig in make
you about a 2in hole on your bank since
I dug right here I've already got a good
ho dug right there all right this should
make you about you don't get real real
deep just take your
burries you getting that Lee mhm just
roll them off in your
hand and just put your burry in that
hole about every six inches
aparts about every six in take rake the
dirt right back over
them all right Pat it with your
hand Pat it down take your hole and just
roll a little bit of your top soil off
right back down in there to level it out
a little bit so rain don't wash
everything away
and that's good now I've still got seed
left so I'll just make me another little
run do the same thing repeat
myself this right here will always
ensure that you'll have S in the same
areas that you hunt I've planted s like
this ever since I was younger and been
digging Jin s and this method has never
now some people would say well just take
them three or four and throw them but if
you just take them and throw them
there's a whole lot more chance at mice
and different things Birds is going to
get these and E them so even though you
just got three or four left just make
you a little spot there to the side drop
them the same
way Pat that down now what I like to do
is reach above myself show up early
reach above myself pull my leaves
down grab me some leaves on a bank it's
not as steep that's a lot simpler but
this still ain't hard I'll take but a
moment now you say well I could have
done dug get rooting them and gone
looking for another one well I could too
but the thing is is I want to come back
here in 10 years and find another one of
these don't you that's right brother
that's proper way of digging that's
proper way of planting you seed good
luck to everybody let's enjoy sing and
take care of it like God intended
