good morning class how we doing this
morning wow you guys see them a little
bit better than they were the other day
good all right what I want to do is give
a demo on one how to cut up that today
and two how to create glazed carrots
someone basically we're always help if
you take the sheets off your uh peeler
so they tell me
all right we're just going to trim this
up a bit
all right
take our scrap put in the corner
all right now we know that the carrot
look at it carrots around they want to
roll will have the same problem with a
parsnip looks like a white pairing at
this point you want to take the small
piece off the carriage itself and lean
it on a flat this way it's not going to
roll on you again you want to square off
your carrot
all right now these that would stay for
let's say I'm doing sweet potatoes or
other generic sweet potatoes and carrot
to gether it'll give it a little bit
more sweetness and great color so save
these if not you can put it into a
stockpot also okay this point I'm
looking for approximately a quarter of
an inch and I'm going to cut that down
like so
all right and I'm going to start cutting
my pieces
okay like this
all right
these are a little bit long or probably
trim them up to about two inches each
again save this this could be a dice for
soup
all right and there you go this is how
you basically get these all right
should have squared off fins right now
take these we have some other ones I'm
going to create some glazed carrots
we're going to do that by adding some
heat add in some water
bringing my water to a boil
having my carrots a little sugar a
little salt pepper and butter like
making a pan sauce this is a delicate
balancing act as we wait for our water
to boil there we go
yeah so you're that
at this point I'm going to put these in
I'm sorry what was question
go get it all in one layer
okay at this point we're cooking off our
carrots
notice the water is starting a little
orange that's not a bad thing it's just
giving off the carotene from the carrot
it's coming out
this point we'll hook it up
now the key is to serve these al dente I
remember without that they means so to
the tooth out and to the tooth
okay at this point I'm going to add a
little bit of sugar right approximately
by the tablespoon you for the exam will
measure it out
I from putting in so many hands of
cooking got a great idea with a
tablespoon looks like it's gonna add a
pinch of salt
and a little black pepper at this point
in time
always pour our ingredients into your
hand by by doing that
that's enough life ever in there I don't
want too much
I want to flavor a nut foot free to burn
and we're going to add a little bit of
butter
through this
we're creating a syrupy glaze with this
when I had just a little bit more butter
in here
take one of these out second
solo hard
little bit not bad
but by the time this comes down I think
it'll be perfect
now at this point
the water the butter becoming one to
creating a temporary emulsion in here
you could add some dill to this doing
carrots work out well you can also
substitute the water for the orange
juice but it's gonna give it a different
flavor I tend to use water instead of
chicken stock because it doesn't have a
muddled kind of flavor to it
alright we're getting real close to
where I want to stop got a real surf I
just want to catch it at that point but
not break the sauce whether it's just
butter because I don't have enough
liquid and I'm there okay I'm there at
this point I want to be there now I'm
not going to serve all this liquid all
right
I just would like to serve a little bit
there you go you just want to glaze the
carrot slightly just giving it a you go
plenty not swimming in sauce
there's your glazed carrots alright
thank you very much for this
demonstration on glazed carrots
