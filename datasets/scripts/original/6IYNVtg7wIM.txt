hey y'all
one of the uh things i like going to the
car shows for especially the bigger ones
not so much a cruise in the parking lot
but any of the bigger car shows is
not just for the hot rods because you
know that's i do like going for that
but is there's always some places there
that are selling fresh squeezed lemonade
and um this is really going to be a
simple video almost silly to make it but
i think there's a lot of people out
there who think lemonade comes from a
can they don't realize that you can
actually make it yourself at home
and to be honest with you it didn't dawn
on me and i was sitting around
complaining about the price at uh
oh one of the car shows i don't know it
was like 12 bucks a glass for this
lemonade and i was complaining about it
and one of my buddies was like well you
do all that cooking watches mix them
yourself and i got to thinking
yeah you know what i bet i can so what
you're gonna need is
i got a juicer here now that juicer was
like three dollars and fifty cents at
walmart
it was a good investment you can do it
by hand i have done it by hand i've
squeezed it by hand before
but today we're going to use a juicer
you're going to need some kind of
container
this container is just an old orange
juice tropicana container
1.8 quartz so almost two quarts
and you're gonna need some kind of
sweetener um trying to keep an eye on my
uh
my figure i'm gonna use some
calorie-free
sweetener i have used sweet and low
before i'm trying splenda today
sweet and low and lemonade for some
reason kind of give it a little bit of a
i don't know a little aftertaste to it
so i'm hoping that i don't get that with
the splenda but we're going to try it
anyhow
um if not i can always go back to sweet
and low and of course if you don't have
a problem with your weight
for sure use pure cane sugar because
that makes the best that's for sure
but anyways let me reset the camera and
get to a point where we can uh
we can ring these lemons out and we'll
get this stuff made it don't take but a
minute
all right for that 1.8 liters it takes
three
lemons so i'd say two quarts is about
the same it takes three
decent sized lemons and um
i waited till i found them on sale
because uh they were a dollar a piece at
one point which makes it kind of
expensive but
i did find them last time i went to the
store or two for a dollar so
it's really you know it's a cheap way to
make lemonade too but then all we're
going to do
is just cut them in half don't need to
lose that
and then with this juicer it's as simple
as sticking it on here
and just juicing it
i like a little pulp in mine so you can
get all we can get out of that
there you go simple
yeah that does that works nice and it's
new to me i've been squeezing my hand up
until this point
but anyways let me get the rest of these
squeezed into this container
and just so you can see you get lemon
juice in the bottom
there you go so you can see you get
lemon juice in the bottom but anyways
that
and i guess another thing i needed to
mention was
you need some water i use a brittle
pitcher so i use purified water
just so you'll get a chlorine taste in
it but start out with it about half full
and uh let me get the rest of these uh
lemons uh juiced up and uh we'll get her
mixed up see what we got
all right one quick clip i just figured
out live and learn right
is there's seeds and lemons but what you
can do
is you can come through and pick these
seeds out
now the advantage is is that i like a
little pulp in my lemonade
and uh if you don't get these seeds out
first
then what you've got to do is you've got
to
pick the seeds out of the pulp or out of
the top of the juicer
or you don't get the pulp at all so
either way
to save yourself having to pick these
seeds out
just come through pick them out first
try to get the line share of them out
and there should be one at every one of
these
kind of juncture things but anyways
and then you can uh
squeeze it or do whatever we're doing
here juice it
and you don't have to worry about that
now what i had to do was come back
because i like said i wanted to pulp in
mine
is what i did is come back and dug
through the pulp and got the seeds out
but uh well i still got one in there
anyways that should eliminate the bulk
of them
but anyways let me finish getting this
ready i'll bring it back
and then what i'm going to do is i'm
just going to pull this off the top
i'm going to pour that into there
and you may end up with a little piece
of seed in there if you choke on it
i didn't say this but it shouldn't hurt
you
and then we got our container we're
gonna
put it in our filtered water
hang on a second i got a better idea
all right better idea instead of trying
to pour it out of that
i'm using a funnel
that way i don't sit there mess around
and end up spilling it's probably okay
probably works fine if you're gonna pour
that juice into a bowl or something like
that but trying to pour it into this
little hole that's kind of a pain
and then uh
well let's do this again i'm going to
use this splenda
and it says that uh each packet of
sweetens like two
teaspoons of sugar so it takes a lot of
sugar
to uh sweeten lemonade so i'm gonna use
about 20 of these packets
i'm not going to sit here and make you
watch me do all 20 of these i'm going to
do them two at a time
but it's just as simple as adding that
to that
so anyways let me get the sugar
sweetener added to it
now when it comes to sweetener that's
going to be kind of a taste thing so
put as much or as little of that as you
want in there and what i like to do
before i finish filling with water
i like to give it a good shake
it helps it mix up the water i'm using
is
room temperature so it helps that sugar
that sweetener dissolve to
because we don't want to have to you
know shake it up every time you get it
out of the refrigerator so
but once you give it a give it a good
shake
then just come back and uh
finish adding your water to it
and there you go fresh squeezed lemonade
and folks have you ever had it i'm sure
you have but if you've never had fresh
squeezed lemonade
it's a hundred times better than just
regular lemonade so anyways what i'm
gonna do is put this in the refrigerator
let it chill and i'll bring it back
we'll do a taste test see how it turned
out
well there you go like i said not a big
uh you know fancy video putting
everything together but more just a
reminder that uh
you know you can make homemade lemonade
and like i said it's so much better than
you know uh the powdered kind or the
kind of comes frozen in a can
or whatever now the only thing do left
left to do is to
taste it and see if it uh see if it
turned out
as good as i think it did
man nothing like it it's been so hot
this summer
people been going without rain make you
some homemade lemonade sit on the porch
enjoy the summer hope you all have
enjoyed it have a good day see ya
you
