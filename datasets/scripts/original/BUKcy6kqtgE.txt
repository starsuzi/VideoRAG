basics of
APA APA style requires that you include
a reference list at the end of your
paper to provide the information
necessary to retrieve and identify each
source that you
site jiu students should always consult
the APA sixth edition publication manual
which provides guidelines for writing
and Publishing
how do I format the reference
list do not bold or underline any
text all entries should be alphabetical
by the author's last name if there is
more than one work by a single author
those Works should be arranged
chronologically indent all lines after
the first line of each entry a half inch
from the
margin double space all entries
throughout the entire reference
list creating the reference
list identify the source is it a book
article web page dissertation or
something else
find a reference example that is most
like your Source in your APA publication
manual 6th edition or from the Purdue Al
website follow that format to construct
your reference
Citation for a periodical periodicals
include items published on a regular
basis such as journals magazines
newspapers and
newsletters this is an example of a
typical periodical citation
only the first word in the title of the
article needs to be
capitalized all major words in the title
of the journal should be capitalized and
the entire title should be
italicized the volume number of the
journal should be italicized and the
issue number is not italicized but put
into
parentheses the DOI is an alpha numeric
code that will show the location of the
document on the internet
the APA recommends using a DOI when one
is available if one is not available you
can provide the homepage URL of the
journal magazine newspaper or newsletter
that you are trying to
site here is a citation for a book both
print version and
electronic notice that book citations
also include location and publisher
here's an example of a citation for a
website when you're citing a website you
want to give as much information as
possible remember that if the
information about the website is too
hard to find it may not be the best
source for your
paper here's an example of a variation
of a website citation
it is appropriate to site N.D do as no
date when no date is
available remember to always check your
APA 6th edition publication manual which
provides examples of how to site many
types of sources in variations of each
Source another fantastic resource for
APA style guidance and tips is the
Purdue Owl website just go to owl.
