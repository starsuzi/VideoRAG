[Music]
we hey everybody Dave nassie over here
at Next Level Guitar and today we're
taking a pretty fun approach to uh this
in the style of today and one thing I
get asked a lot about is how to make all
the fun tremolo noises so we're going to
try to cover as many as we possibly can
we're going to get the classic dive
bombs
we're going to get some of the harmonic
die
bombs and you know maybe some fun animal
noises all along the way at the same
time so let's check this out the Lemur
can we do a lemur I don't know if I can
do a lemur no lemur I can definitely
approach with a sloth I can figure out a
way to pull it otter I know sloth oh can
you do a duck bill platypus I can't I
can't do a duck bill platypus hey
everybody how you doing I'm going to say
it I'm really excited to say it click on
the link that you see below if you click
on that link you're going to get some
good information you're going to get a
coinciding eBook and a free lesson that
is not available on YouTube so let's say
that click on that link you're going to
get a lesson that is not available on
YouTube free a coinciding ebook free
full of great information cord shapes
scale diagrams all that kind of stuff
click on that link but there's a lot
that we can do and it'll all be great so
check this out the first thing that
we're going to try to accomplish is
really it mimics like a
[Music]
horse we know know some people out there
who have done this
before that was one of the my most
favorite things to do it drove my
neighbors crazy my Mom hated it I loved
every minute of it and it was classic
rock guitar so the way that we do this
is we want to think of how we grab the
tremolo bar that's the most important
thing when I go to grab this thing I've
got my third finger my pinky and uh you
know my middle grabbing it so when I go
up for the bend this is what happens
with this left hand I hit an artificial
harmonic on the third fret and I bend it
up and I grab the bar so I
go that's the motion of course it sounds
a little cooler when you hit
it
now that's how I'm going to dive that's
what you initially want to get used
to there's a good
one so a pinch harmonic you know to
achieve this this is that whole tricky
thing of using a little bit of the
plastic of the pick and and your skin of
your finger there
[Music]
get that kind of sound I'm going to turn
my body this way and if I can point it
out really clearly it hits right about
here on my pick is where I get that uh
that pinch harmonic just right there and
I don't have a lot of the pick exposed
that's a big part of it and I kind of
like to rake into my
[Music]
pinches now the raking
motion comes from a lot of the muting
with my left hand now so I'll kind of
turn my body this way just ever so
slightly so you can kind of see that
I've got the
muted and it's muted with my thumb the
way I'm grabbing the guitar just this
way so I'm muting into that pinch
harmonic I establish the pinch then I
stretch the note go for the
tremol now I recommend grabbing it this
way just because you can have a little
bit more control you don't end up
wrenching it too hard unless that's your
desired effect but you get this
nice and you use usually need quite a
bit of distortion or sustain on your
tone to be able to get this going uh the
nice horse
effect of course you can see that the
motion of my hand is moving down like
this just kind of pushing it up letting
the tension of the guitar guide me back
up I don't force it back up that's a big
thing when I depress on the tremolo bar
I let it come back on its own that's a
big part
of so you can achieve the horse effect
by bending the note you can do that
anywhere you don't have to just do it
there
you can hit any note and really go for
that kind of you know overall feel now a
lot of players will use this in the
middle of a lick you can
[Music]
go and that's kind of a nice little
tremolo trick if you
go and you get like a nice little dip
into the
[Music]
bend and I'm going to pull
off see that that little effect there I
go down Pull Hammer dip
pull classic kind of
[Music]
lick and it's a good way to finish it
you know and a lot of times if you're
trying to recreate a solo that has it
it's kind of difficult to do it without
the bar but it's fun to try if you don't
have
[Music]
one now you get different effects if you
can tighten it a little bit here and if
maybe we want to
flick it with your pinky you get kind of
a nice little
[Music]
trick that's a really good you know kind
of jittery effect you get the same thing
if you put it back
here and you can hear it gets a little
bit noisy right off the strings but what
I'm doing is just kind
of a little bit of a flicker with it
different preference going this way you
get kind of a neat sound and you could
do some cool dips with it like
this that one's always good to do and
sometimes if you use a whammy pedal you
can really get that crazy high pitch now
what this does or how I do this rather
is I'm using my left hand to pluck off
the third string to
dive on the way back up didn't really
happen because I let it go too long but
on the way back up I hit a harmonic on
any one of these desired locations
you're going to get a better effect off
of 12 7 and five F3 is pretty sweet to
do but you get it on the way back up and
then it continues to uh take that pitch
along with
it and if you have a recess routed Floyd
that means it's dipped back here you got
a bit more room so if you're like hey
man I don't have a Floyd I can crank
back up on you can still do
it it's still totally
[Music]
there and with a Floyd you know can
get I can get down there this thing's
going to be in tune when I come back so
if you've got a guitar that's a little
tricky with the tremolo take it in
stride you know you don't want to get
too crazy with it right
away have it not be in tune you know
when you get back cuz that kind of
deters you sometimes from trying to get
into it now let's think of some other
fun things that we could kind of do here
that are always really really good if we
want to talk about animals right we're
in living in the animal
kingdom I'm going to try my best to pull
off this elephant and we will see what
happens and see if we can actually make
this happen the way we do this is we're
going to hit a harmonic on five and
we're going to hit double harmonics
we're hitting five uh on or fifth fret
rather with the second and first string
then we go to seven and then we go to 12
we're going to reach
over and we're going to pull up with the
bar or push up with the bar and use the
volume with the right hand to uh try to
get that desired effect I recommend
being on a treble pickup when you try to
do this and and we'll see what we get
we'll see what happens hit or
miss that wasn't too bad it wasn't too
bad we'll go we'll see two out of
[Music]
three yeah it's not too bad so you get
the overall effect but it's fun to do
you know I used to love these things I
had a neighbor used to fracture a lot or
two used to do that and just drive him
crazy all the time right you know he
never knew what was coming
just fun fun that we have when we have
too much time on our hands and that's
what the guitar is for right to do all
these things okay miles we're going to
try this here buddy I'm sorry but I got
to move you a little bit miles is
sitting right here and we're going to
see if we can wake miles up with a
little noise let's see if we can get the
oh wait hold on
Miles hold
on trying to make little cat noises but
it's not disturbing the animal he sleeps
pretty hard he sleeps pretty
heavy but anyways that's the effect I'm
trying to go for miles is kind of on the
WWA pedal so it's a little it's a little
hard to make it happen but we're having
fun over here so to achieve this even
without a WWA pedal what you can do is
of course we're going to turn down our
volume just a little bit we're going to
put our tremolo bar here and we're going
to hammer and dip right at the same
time can you hear that hope it's loud
enough a little louder
everybody likes a little Pur kitty cat
all right everybody I think we've had
some fun with this lesson we've gone
through a few different things to
[Music]
do noises that we could make things that
remind everybody that you're learning
how to play the guitar and from your
neighbor's point of view hey you know
what that's just not a bad thing so go
