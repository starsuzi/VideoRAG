hello everybody I'm Charlie and today
I'm going to be showing you how to make
fried okra my recipe for fried okra
calls for a nice crispy and delicious
fried okra and actually this recipe is
um more healthier than some other
recipes because I am using van Ola oil
and egg whites for my okra so without
further Ado let's get started y okay
this is all what you're going to need to
make your fried
okra and uh we going to get started with
our ingredients here I have two 12 oz
bags that's about 24 oz of cut okra now
you can buy it whole but if you buy a
whole one thing you have to do is just
take it and cut
it and it's going to be cut ochre but
normally I get the 16 oz bag but they
didn't have that so I settled for the 12
oz and I got two 12 oz and there we have
it and that equals to about um a pound
and a half okay and with your cut okra
you're going to need eggs now we're only
going to use egg whites for this recipe
okay also with that you're going to need
some
cornmeal some salt some
accent and some canol oil I forgot to
mention that you can also use use
vegetable oil for this recipe if you
want to um just know that um canola oil
is healthier than vegetable oil
so it's optional whether if you want to
use vegetable oil or canola
oil and there you have it okay so in a
large bowl here we're going to add six
egg
whites okay you want to make sure you
don't want any yolk in there okay make
sure you separate
that now if you want to save your yolks
you can just put them in this bowl over
here and use that for a different recipe
now that we have our uh egg white whites
in a bowl
here we're going to add 1/4 teaspoon of
salt to
that okay and we're going to mix this
in okay now that we have that mixed in
we're going to set that
aside okay so in the large bowl we
already added one package of okra in
here so we're going to add the second
package so that's about 24 oz all
together of cut
ochre
okay and to that we're going to
add less than one teaspoon of accent
okay now not not it's not all the way
forward to the top as you can see we're
just going to sprinkle that over the
top and we're going to mix that
in make sure it's I toss it around real
good
and this accent will give your okra a
nice little
flavor okay now that we have that mixed
in we're going to set that
aside and we're going to have our batter
Bowl right here
here
okay we're going to add 4 and 1/2 cups
of yellow cornmeal in
here okay and to that we're going to add
2
tablespoon of
salt okay and we're going to just mix
this in
a lot of people think that that's a lot
of salt but hey you you you need a
little flavor to your
okra and I don't see any other flavor to
add to your okra but salt
so and you can also use co co your Sal
salt as
well okay think I might add a little bit
more salt to this cuz I don't think that
was enough see that a little sprinkle
more that's all
okay that should do it right
there that extra little sprinkle was
probably about less than a little
teaspoon you
know okay now that we have this mixed in
now it's time to go ahead and prepare
our okra for frying okay in a
mediumsized pot we're going to go ahead
and add some uh pure canola oil in there
we just going to keep adding it
in about that much now that's just about
the whole bottle
okay now if you want um if you have a
deep fryer that's perfect if you have a
deep fried um preheat your deep fried to
350 and there there you
go going to preheat your fire to medium
high heat medium
high okay
and over here make sure you have some uh
paper plate aligned with some uh napkins
with a lot of napkins cuz that's what
you're going to need to add your ochre
to and that'll drain all the grease and
everything
okay now on to the next step okay here I
have our uh chopped up
okra and now what we're going to do is
we're going to give the okra a
bath so what we're going to do is we're
going to take our egg white mixture that
we have
here and we're going to add that right
into our
okra okay we're going to mix this in now
the reason why we're adding this in here
is
because we want all the okra to be
coated now I understand the okra is a
bit slimy but the Slime part is just not
enough so we need to add something such
as egg whites and this is a bit
healthier compared to some people who
use the whole eggs
okay okay now that we've been mixing our
ochra up what now what we're going to do
is we're going to go ahead and we're
going to strain our okra so we're going
to go ahead and dump that right on in
there
kind move that around a little bit get
it to strain a little bit okay now we're
going to do is we're going to let this
sit and strain for about 3 minutes okay
we've been straining our OA for about 3
minutes now what we're going to do is
we're going to go ahead and put it into
our batter
here now we want to add this a little
bit at a
time
okay and that right on in there for
about three big
spoons
okay okay we're going
to go ahead and shake that
up get our okra nice and coated
now bowl with a top would be perfect
okay so that way you won't have a flour
mess or flow shower all over your
kitchen okay now that we have our okra
nice and coated now it's time to fry it
the best
part okay we have a little bit of our
okra
here take a little bit of
it and fry it
make careful how you dump it in there
cuz you don't want that grease popping
up on
you okay as you can see our ochre is
frying and what you're going to do is
you're going to let this okra fry for
about five to six minutes
okay you want it to be a nice little
golden brown
color
okay okay we've been letting our ochre
fry for about 5 to 6 minutes and what
we're going to do now is we're going to
transfer it into our um dish so the
grease can drain okay make sure you use
a spoon that has holes at the bottom
okay okay we're going to take our
ochre add it
into our Bowl here to our plate here
with the napkins
off okay that's the last of
it and there you have it for right okra
now you want to let this cool for about
1 to 2 minutes only okay and serve
immediately this is meant to be served
nice and hot out of the fryer okay just
like when you go to McDonald's and you
order nice thing a medium fries you want
them nice and hot straight off the fry
it that's the same thing with this okra
straight out the grease
eat now if you let it sit for too long
the texture won't be the same okay
that's like eating cold fries from
McDonald's nobody likes cold fries from
McDonald's right okay so this is meant
to be served nice and hot right now okay
so without further Ado now we're going
to go ahead and take a
bite can't
wait now it's time to take a bite can't
wait all right
it's nice it's
crunchy not salty at all it's actually
very
good but like I said don't let your Ocho
get too cold cuz it'll be like eating
McDonald's french fries and that's not a
good thing
it's actually pretty
good well there you have it fried
ochre hey guys I hope you enjoyed this
