[Music]
Caesar welcome to the cocktail Spirit
from small screen network I'm your host
Robert Hess in the past we've looked at
the Bloody Mary and the red snapper both
tomato Savory style drinks there's
another drink in this family that you
may have heard of but you may not have
had of it's called the Caesar it's from
our friends up north in Canada and it's
extremely popular out there but I really
don't see people are ordering it
elsewhere let's take a look now
apparently this drink was invented in
1969 by Walter Chell in the Calgary Inn
in Calgary Alberta in in Canada of
course um he wanted to make a special
drink and he spent quite a while
perfecting the recipe uh he ended up
with a recipe that was 1 2 3 4 in making
it he started off with one shot or an
ounce and a half of
vodka
so that was the one the two was two
dashes of Tabasco
sauce the three was three dashes of salt
and
pepper one two
3 one two
three the four was four dashes of wor
sour
sauce one 2 3
4 and then lastly he added Clamato juice
this is basically tomato juice with clam
nectar in it as well um it's rather
unique as a you know proprietary product
by this company um so it's not like a
generic tomato juice you might find from
campal or your local Safeway or whatever
um so that might be one of the reasons
you don't see it much because Cato is
not going to be a common ingredient
found in many
bars now before I mix this up let me
prepare the glass uh the glass is going
to be uh pint glass a flute glass you
know something big and tall like this
that we want to take and add celery salt
to the rim now here's one of the
important aspects of [ __ ] a drink
that I think is important to remember
the idea is not to get the ingredient on
the inside of the glass but the outside
only
we're going to take a
lemon and wet the edge of the glass with
lemon
juice it's important to notice that this
drink didn't really include lemon juice
in the recipe at all I'm using lemon
juice just on the outside like this now
to rim it rather than taking and
sticking the glass into it which is
going to add the lemon juice or the the
spices on the inside as well I'm just
going to take a spoon and knock it over
the
outside
so all we
have is
spices on the outside of the
glass knock off the excess make a slight
mess on my table here then we're going
to ice the glass
up
and we're going to ice the drink
up and as is commonly done with a bloody
Mary and a red snapper going to roll
this drink rather than shaking it or
stirring
it
then we're going to strain
this into our prepared
glass I'm going to take a
lemon and cut a
wedge and slice
up the edge like
that and add that as a
garnish again this can be one of those
drinks you take and add a wild set of
garnishes yourself whether it's celery
or asparagus or green beans or
avocados who knows uh but the aspect is
making sure you're getting the drink
with Cato juice without any lemon juice
added and adding all the other
ingredients you might do with a bloody
mary or a red
snapper let's give this a try now the
celery salt on the outside is going to
take and add an initial hit when your
tongue when you're drinking it uh
sometimes you want to take and maybe
work your way around the glasses you're
drinking it sometimes you only focus on
just one spot so it's just that first
hit you're getting that salt hit
depending on what you like
drinking that's got a wonderful Savory
flavor to it I think the Cato juice I
personally love just on its own and so
in a drink like this it really takes and
adds that nice little spectacular flavor
that a little bit different you're not
expecting in a Bloody Mary so the next
time you're out and you want something a
little bit different than a bloody mary
see whether your bartender can make you
a
Caesar
