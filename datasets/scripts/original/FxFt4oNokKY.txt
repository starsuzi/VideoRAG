hey everyone my name is Ola and today
I'm going to show you how to make an
animated sail in blender and this is not
a b tutorial so I'm just going to make
the Mast and the sale and I'm going to
show you how to uh control it so let's
get started I want to start off by going
to the top view npad 7 and then left
click to add a 3D cursor and the 3D
cursor is the place where the object is
going to spawn so I'm going to add a
cylinder and I'm going to scale it down
with
s let click s to
scale and scale it down to the size you
want and I'm going to go to uh y frame
to see through it and I'm going to grab
it upwards so G set to grab it on the
set axis and you can scale it down a
little bit more with
s
and let's go to solid
mode and now I'm going to start editing
the cylinder itself so we're going going
to go to edit mode and that way we can
extrude on the set axis to make it uh
taller so select top face go to face
select and to make it taller you can
both click G set to grab it on the set
axis but you can also make a new
face and click e set to extrude it on
the set axis so there are two different
ways to do
it now have the
Mast and if you want to make the whole
Mast thicker or
thinner you can
always click a to select everything and
click s shift set so that you only scale
it on the X and the y axis so that you
make it
thinner now you can click g y to grab it
on the y- axis to move it forward and
backwards on the
boats
and now I'm going to left click to add a
3D
cursor to add a new cylinder which is
going to hold the
flag so add a new
cylinder and I'm going to rotate the
cylinder so click R y90 to rotate at 90°
on the y axis and click s to scale it
down now I'm going to scale it on the
x-axis to click
SX to scale it on the
xaxis to make it
longer just make sure that the middle is
uh on the other
cylinder okay so now that the very basic
M we just made is done we're going to
start adding the sail itself and we're
going to use a plane to make saale and
click rx90 to rotated 90° on xaxis
and grab it on set axis G
set and we're going to start scaling it
to fit it on the uh M itself so click SX
scale it on the
x-axis and I'm also going to make it
longer downwards I'm going to go to edit
mode select the lower Edge and grab it
on the set axis so G set to grab it on
the set
axis okay okay the next thing we are
going to do is to click controlr to add
a loop cuts that way we can make the uh
sail a little bit more baggy click G
then
y to grab it on the y-
axis and you might as well grab it on
the set axis as well if you want
to just to give it a baggy
effect because if it's completely flat
it's not going to be very baggy because
it's not big
enough when we make the sale
simulator Okay click a to select
everything and click W to
subdivide and bum pump the number of
cuts to
about
20 and now that we have all the
subdivisions we're going to select the
um
pinning points that we're going to add
to the sale simulator and these points
while holding in shift to select are
going to be the points that are going to
stick when we have a class
simulator so that when we add wind those
points are not going to
move you can also select uh these verses
by clicking
C and select them that way instead of
right
clicking
okay now I have all the points we needed
selected so now we're going to add a
vertx group so go up here in the
settings and add a new verx group and
click
assign and now we're going to add a CLA
simulator go to the
top and maybe you should go to the
object mode first and then click
cloth and now we're going to add a
pinning and the pinning are the verx
groups so the points that are going to
stick when we add a
simulator
so before we start baking we should add
in Wind as
well and to add wind you click shift a
and then click
wind okay so after you added wind just
make sure that the wind turns towards
the sail
and then grab it a little bit away from
it and rotate it towards the sail again
and bump upm the strength
to
about
400 and that should be
enough okay so now we have the sale we
have the wind so now we going to
start calculating the simulation and the
way to do that is to go to the sale
itself select
it so right click to select and go to
solid mode to see how it
looks and now we are going to go down in
the
settings and click
bake now it's calculating and after it's
done you go to the first frame and then
click play
as you can see now we have a uh moving
sale and after you have calculated you
can always go back and free the bake and
change the
settings so if you're not happy about
something in the
simulator you can always for example
change the noise change the strength
change the weight of the
sail and just make it look different
give it a different look so go back to
the sale
now now to make it better looking you
can always click smooth to make it
smoother
and give it a nicer
look and now I'm going to add a new
simulator with a new settings we just
added so go down to the
settings and free the
bake
so if you just scroll down free bake and
bake
again and after I've speed it up I go to
the first
frame and
again we have the
sale and now what I'm going to do is to
start animating the boat itself so that
the sail is following the
boat and the way to do that is to start
parenting the s to the Mast and the Mast
to the
boat so first select the sail and then
select the uh M and click control p and
set parent
two and I'll click that one select the
main m contrl p set parent to
object and do the same with the main
M select the
boats
afterwards and and click contrl
P now the m and the sail is following
the boats when we animate
it so I'm going to select the
boats and Click N to get up the
coordinates and click I to key frame so
I I and I move forward in the
timeline let's say the frame
250 and click G
then y to grab it on y-
axis and then click I I I and I
again and if you go to the graph editor
click T and click linear the animation
will have the same speed at all times
instead of speeding up and slowing down
which looks often a lot
better okay so free bake
again and click
bake now it's going to calculate the
animation with a boat moving and as you
can see it works now I didn't add any um
ropes in this
tutorial but I think you can make that
yourself you can make if you can make a
good boat you can obviously make some
ropes there a lot of tutorials out there
on ropes so you should be
okay okay so now I'm going to show you
one more thing before the tutorial is
over and that is how to rotate the
m so that the sail rotates while the
boat is moving so I'm going to select
the M go to frame one and I'm going to
start key framing the rotation of the
MS so go up here click I I I and
I move forward a few frames I'm not
going to move it or rotate in the first
frames so I'm just going to have the
same
values and now now if I go to the one of
the last frames I'm going to rotate it R
set on the set
axis like this so I rotate it and click
I I I and I again the key frame the
coordinates and the
rotation and now we have a rotation the
m so now I'm going to select the sale
again click free bake and bake again
and after the calculation is done we can
see how it
looks as you see the sale follows the
rotation of the masks so the animation
is
working and that's it for this tutorial
