right this week beat short rib foe
[Music]
Abit open you up absolutely delicious
things like
greatness right beef Fae is just one of
those dishes that you want to learn to
cook it's great at this time of year
where it's cold it's super simple to do
and it tastes knockout so first off
let's get the beef short rib
going I love beef short ribs they're
just so good for loads of different
things what's Inc about this is it's
cooked on the bone so there's so much
flavor that comes out of there there's
collagen in there that's really good for
you it's got that bone marrow in there
and it just bleeds into the stock it's
so super tasty and you've got all this
marbling that equals flavor so we drop
this into the pan we put some seasonings
in there we cook it in stock low and
slow for 5 hours and then it's ready for
the snizzle so into
pan right now I'm going to get the dry
ingredients in so you want four cloves
get them in one nice big fat cinnamon
stick and then you want two
staranise okay now for the fresh
ingredients first up a nice thumb of
Ginger okay so I've got a nice thumb of
Ginger there now a lot of people will
take the skin off but I'm not going to
I'm just going to pulverize it leave the
skin on and pull it out at the
[Music]
end one whole onion sliced and
[Music]
diced and a tablespoon of fish
sauce okay now we're ready for the stock
NOW most people just put beef stock in I
put a little bit of chicken stock in
there because I don't want it to be too
beefy it can be too heavy the chicken
stock still has a matness to it but it
also gives it like it's just a bit
different you can do whatever you want
this is my take on a beefo so a liter of
chicken stock and a liter of beef stock
yeah people it's that cold on the bloody
street the stocks are jelly
jellified liter of beef
stock liter of chicken
stuck okay lid on and then we cook it
low and slow for 4 and 1/2 to 5 hours
until the beef is falling off the
bone right that's been going for about
four or 5 hours now just come and have a
butches at this how beautiful is that so
much flavor and remember all the
beautiful goodness that's in the bone
has bled into the stock that's going to
come off the bone I'm going to cut it
into nice thin slices but before we need
to now strain the
stock now just push the Sweet Sticky
onions through and any excess moisture
back through into the stock it's going
to be so
good okay and then let's get that back
into the pan and onto the
heat right while that's heating back
through let's take the beef off the bone
and slice it
[Music]
up look at that clean bone going to
taste so
[Music]
good now just look how tender and
beautiful that is just look at how the
beef is just falling away and that's
going to sit in that beautiful stock
with noodles and garnishes it's going to
be Sumptuous right let's get the noodles
into the stock come here mate mate come
here come here come here come here come
here I need you to just try
this open your Gob get it
in tasty
delicious very good very good very it's
very
[Music]
good okay now rice noodles are
traditional with faux nothing else these
are the bad boys to use end the story
all right now if my bowl that I was
putting them in were big enough it's not
then you could put them in there and
then you can pour the boiling hot Fae
all over it the alternative way to do it
is to put it straight in and cook them
in the FAE and then move them into the
ball which is the way I'm going to do
[Music]
it okay now to garnish the FAE I've got
the following I've got some Thai Basel
I've got some red chili I've got some
beautiful fresh mint I've got some
whites of spring onion and I've got some
bean sprouts and then on top of that
will be the nice slices of beef short
rib okay right so the noodles are done
I'm going to take them out put them into
the bowl but leave the stock still in
there and then I'm going to garnish
everything drop the beef on top and then
we Ladle the stock over
[Music]
