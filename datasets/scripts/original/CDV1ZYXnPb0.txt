hey how's it going this is Dan with
hardcor pear.com today we're going to be
making a tutorial video on the masking
tape method the advanced masking tape
method uh as you can see we have Hulk
Hogan here from the arcade game
WrestleMania making a call out to the
crowd can you hear him pump him up he's
going to I do a body slam uh so we got
it all built first thing always check
your work get your Sprite there this is
just Kindle with the picture
viewer made the bead sprite with uh
Microsoft Paint throwing the Grid on
there check your work make sure
everything's
up once you got that good to go you're
ready to tape
up this right here is a loom tool it's a
good little tool for doing things make
sure all your beads are lined up see we
got some little errant ones here get
that moved over get them as close as you
can cuz you're about to tape this up and
you don't want them to move at
all so I've already done most of the
board already here we're ready to tape
up this is 3M masking tape big fat
masking tape for your bigger jobs this
is going to make your life a lot easier
get some of this start off just get some
tape figure out what you're going to do
make the piece a little bigger than it
needs to be tear it off there and just
go ahead and you know get one end on the
board
already and then just lay it on
Top push it on there a little bit get
the other end on the board
lightly next piece of
paper same kind of thing here just get
them lined up you don't want it to not
have a little overlap but not too much
overlap just a little bit of overlap is
right you'll see
why in the next
video so we got the second piece on
there don't have to put it on too rough
just make sure it's on there always a
good idea to wash your hands before
doing this sticky hands will bring that
tape back up after you've put it down
and then you will pick up the beads and
everything else and you do not want to
do that
next piece
there there we
go and just keep repeating this until
you're
done get that bad boy on
there and get some shorter pieces
and it's a pretty basic
procedure now
this is a good thing to save your boards
cuz when you have something this big and
you're heating it up these boards are
going to
warp they are designed to warp a little
bit they're designed as you can see with
this Square pattern that's in there to
come up when it gets heated instead it
is straight up
breaking smaller patterns are not
difficult to iron on the board and
plenty of people have ironed bigger
pieces on the board too
but I found that you will screw things
up well here we just got his
legs let's see if we can get this all
with one
piece little bit too big
there let's shorten this piece P up
some
okay oh there we go this is what happens
when you're not careful with your tape
normally I'm going to have this thing in
front of me and being careful
but I have my lovely assistant here
taping this and I'm trying to give you
the best view possible and in the
process screwing up
creation not a big
deal not going to going to get mad about
it on camera I'm not going to get
upset I'm not going to
cry I'm going to stay strong and just
finish this
up okay I'm over
it
okay there we
go when we get down to this little
bit let me get the small masking tape
out try and conserve a little
bit one little tiny piece
there we
go
oh okay so this is
not entirely a disaster we're going to
fix that up we're going to tape it we're
going to do the thing we're not going to
make this video too long but you get the
idea I'm going to get my my example here
get my guy booted back
up zoom in on that
leg and fix them not a big deal tape the
rest of it so this is uh part one of the
video part two we're going to show you
some Advanced kind of stuff uh so yeah
go and click on link part two
