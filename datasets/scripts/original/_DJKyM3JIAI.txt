How to Make a Diorama.
A fun craft project for the kids or for a
book report, history class, or science project
for school, a diorama brings three-dimensional
reality to any idea.
You will need Theme Cardboard box or shoebox
Poster paint and paintbrushes Cardboard or
construction paper Miniature figurines Scissors
Craft glue Dental floss or sewing thread and
clear tape.
Step 1.
Decide on a theme, such as the ocean, the
rainforest, the solar system, or a favorite
scene from a book.
Make a list of all the elements to include
and any important action in the scene you
want to depict.
Step 2.
Turn a cardboard box, like a shoebox, on its
side.
Paint the colors of the background landscape,
including the sea, sky, and ground, or glue
construction paper to the inside.
Decorate the top and both sides.
Let it dry thoroughly.
Step 3.
Gather your miniature figurines, or cut out
figures from construction paper or cardboard
painted to look like the people, objects,
or animals in your scene.
Keep proper scale in mind for realism.
The miniature standard is 1 foot to 1 inch.
Step 4.
Work from the back of the box to the front,
placing your figures inside.
Glue them in place when you find the layout
you like.
Step 5.
Consider hanging objects from the top of the
box, such as birds, or fish in an ocean scene,
using dental floss or sewing thread and clear
tape.
Those extra details will bring life to your
display and wow your classmates!
