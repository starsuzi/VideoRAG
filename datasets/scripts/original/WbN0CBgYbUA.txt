hey guys it's m and I'm going to be
doing another new video today and I'm
doing DIY acrylic paint tie dye
t-shirt um like I said in my other video
I saw this on Pinterest this is actually
another shirt that I made and I really
like the way this one came out so I'm
going to be making another one today and
I'm going to show you guys how to do it
okay so what you're going to need
is okay so white
T-shirt a
fork rubber
bands I'm just doing um one color today
this one I use two colors I use blue and
black but for this one I'm doing a light
blue and I use two different types of
acrylic paint I use this blue one called
real blue and this is just by the Brand
Apple barel and then white
so what I did was I didn't have those
little clear bottles that most people
use so I just got like an old shampoo
bottle and filled it up you I used I
used warm water just cuz it works better
and then I did a little bit of the
blue and a little bit of the white so
I'm just going to show you how I do
these so first I get my
shirt I'm going to lay it down and I
have I have a plastic bag laid down
because this can get very
messy um yeah so take your fork put it
in the middle of the
shirt and
just
just twist it like
this until you get the whole thing
twisted around
so it's really hard to do sometimes and
this shirt's really thick so I'm just
going to take the work out and start
putting the rubber bands on which I
probably should have taken them off my
wrist
[Music]
first and since I'm only using one other
color today when I do this I'm only
going to be
um like I'll show you when I do it but
only one side is going to get colored
but I'm going to put a lot of rubber
bands on
it and when you do this you can rubber
band it however you
want I'm just doing a regular spiral
today and I really hope this comes out
good I'm really excited I've really been
enjoying making these tie
shirts okay I think I put it enough
rubber bands but I'm just going to go
I'm going to REO around some of the
thinner rubber bands and put more than
one
[Music]
on okay now that that's
done I'm just going to use one of the
pink bands I'm going to use one going
this way as like a divider I'm going to
do the top half so I'm only going to put
Blue on this
part of
it and this can get a little messy so
just do over something
plastic and then I'm just uh pouring it
on there and then like if it starts
dripping a lot I just dip it in there
and let the fabric soak it
in you can see the color I really like
that color
[Music]
and I looked up acrylic paint with
tie-dye like on YouTube and I saw a
couple of videos I saw this one video
that this girl used like this what it
looks like to me this really expensive
like acrylic paint for like canvas and I
was like oh my gosh but hers came out
really nice so I was like I'm going to
try this and I'm doing the method she
did like she only did half half
so hope it comes out
good and usually these take a while to
dry like I thought 6 hours would be
enough to let one dry
completely I I left it out in the sun I
let it stay in front of my AC but it
takes I want to say at least 14
hours to get completely dry so what I do
is I let it dry a little bit in the Sun
of my e and then I'll just hang it up to
dry and then hanging it up is a lot
faster and I'm almost done with the half
of it I think I'm going to do a little
bit more in this
[Music]
hand okay I'm almost done
[Music]
[Music]
okay I think I'm done and this is what
it looks like now sometimes I put it in
a plastic bag like a plastic um zipl bag
or I just let it dry without it I think
I'm just going to let it dry without it
and then I will come
back when it's dry I'll show you guys
the finished product later okay bye
