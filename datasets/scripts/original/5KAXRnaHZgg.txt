Alright!This is John Kohler from okraw.com.
Today we have another exciting episode for
you and this is an episode that a lot of you
guys have been inquiring about due to an Instagram
post that I had actually when I made a raw,
vegan, vanilla ice cream with uh, no dairy
cream.
You guys wanted a video on how I made it so
now I'm making a video for you guys on how
I made it.
It is super simple, real easy and it actually
only takes three simple ingredients to make
this raw, vegan, ice cream.
Now I will let you guys know in advance that
this does take some time making ice cream
from scratch, ya know, from a vegan foods
but I'm gonna take the time in this episode
to share it with you guys in case you wanted
to do it you know, I met other raw foodists
for example that, say John I don't believe
that you take an hour to make your ice cream.
Well yea from the time you getting the coconuts,
chopping them up, scooping out the meat, shaving
them off, blending them, and then extracting
the rich cream, blending it all up and then
putting it in the ice cream maker, man it
could take like an hour and I know a lot of
you guys might just want to go down to the
store and buy some vegan ice cream in the
section and just take it home and eat it.
Now when you're eating that stuff you know
you're eating all kinds of monodyglycerides
and all kinds of other processed sugars, that
are not whole foods sources of sugar and in
this case fat, there would be isolated nutrients
which I'm not a big fan of.
So I'm gonna encourage you guys to always
eat whole foods and yes, it's gonna take a
little bit longer and if you don't wanna do
this recipe then of course I'd recommend you
guys make some kind of banana ice cream recipe
which you know, people say yea it tastes like
ice cream and yea, don't get me wrong, banana
ice cream tastes great, lower in fat, but
ya know, it doesn't have that mouth feel,
that, that rich, texture of real ice cream
and so that's what this recipe that I have
created simulates like it simulates raw, vegan
vanilla ice cream to the T!
And so anyways let's get into it.
So uh, it's very, this is a very simple easy
recipe.
Only three ingredients.
Number one we got coconut here, couple different
kinds, I'll explain that in a second.
We got 16 dates right here, pitted dates and
we got one vanilla, we'll talk more about
this vanilla bean in a second and of course
we got the coconut water that came out of
the coconut, ya know, that I got the meat
from and we got about 28 ounces of water.
So the first thing that's critical to make
this recipe work properly is to make sure
you get the right coconut.
So in general I use two coconuts and I usually
use the white kind coconut, that's this kind
of coconut.
A lot of you guys may be familiar with like
the more brown kind.
This kind is too old, the meat's too thick
and too hard and doesn't come out quite the
same consistency.
I mean it'll work if you don't have anything
else, but I would recommend getting the white
ones.
The white ones are basically just younger
than the brown ones but on that end sometimes
there's really young white ones and more mature
white ones so in the case of this ice cream
you want to pick a more mature white one.
How could you tell if it's a more mature white
coconut?
Well you kinda wanna look through the white
and look underneath the white so we like look
underneath the white here at the bottom, you
could kind of see that it's actually brown
like a dark brown shell underneath the white
color.
So that's kind of what we're looking at and
that's a perfect consistency to get.
Also when you shake the white coconut, for
this recipe anyways, you wanna hear the water
slosh around.
Cause if it's totally full of water that means
the meat may be too thin, and you're not gonna
have enough fat that's actually gonna make
the vegan cream for this ice cream recipe.
The next thing I do is I pop out one of the
holes, drain out all the water, in the container,
it's the same water that I'll be using to
blend up and make the cream and so once we
do that, then we basically take the uh, a
cleaver and just basically tap it and turn
it all the way around like on the equator
and this basically breaks in half and what
you're gonna have is the half that kind of
looks like this and now the challenge is you're
gonna have to get the coconut meat out of
the coconut.
So then I have a coconut demeaning tool, I'll
remember I'll put a link down below this video.
The coconut demeaning tool obviously go between
the coconut shell and the meat and you just
wiggle this all the way around and I've already
pre-done that for this video actually so I'm
making it look really easy and uh basically
what happens is then you could just go ahead
and pull out the meat whole.
Now the next step is once you pull out the
meat you're gonna see some of this testa material.
You know, generally you don't have to pull
this off.
It may affect the flavor so I pull it off.
Also it makes for a cleaner presentation if
you don't have all the brown cause that'll
make your ice cream much darker than it really
needs to be.
And also sometimes when you're using these
coconuts, sometimes it may be going bad so
if you, if it's like a little bit like maybe
more brownish or pinkish, reddish, that's
maybe a discoloration maybe mold going on.
So that's another reason why I encourage you
guys to shave it down.
So uh this is what it looks like when it's
shaved down and not shaved down and so basically
I just take a knife to shave it down and I
just put this down and I just go down and
basically peel off a really thin layer on
the coconut-I prepared for my recipe.
So I’m going to go ahead and does this off
camera will come back at you when I’m ready
to mix up all the ingredients.
All right got all that coconut up so we’re
just going to go ahead and take all this coconut
meat and we’re just going to go ahead and
throw it up in the blender.
Now the reason why I’m using the coconut
instead of a tree nuts is because we’re
just trying to get a cream and when you use
the nuts you also add the fiber which is something
I don’t want because in real ice cream there’s
like no fiber, it’s basically just like
fat from milk.
I don’t want you guys to drink any milk.
Milk is not necessary neither any dairy product.
Actually based on my research, there’s nothing
in milk that we can’t get from other plant
foods and further more milk can increase the
rate of igf-1 in your body which will basically
supercharge cancer growth and what not in
addition all milks unless it’s human milk
contains foreign proteins which our immune
systems may have an immune response due to
the dairy and so it’s also inflammatory
in my opinion especially if you drink too
much but I don’t like to drink any that’s
why we’re using the coconuts.
So on besides the coconuts we’re also going
to add the coconut water here.
I got 28 ounces today.
And let’s see we’re probably going to
add may be like we’re going to start off
with like a 20 like around 24 ounces.
All right so I think we added about 24 ounces
of water there.
The next step is we’re just going to simply
blend this baby up on high.
All right I think we’re done blending there
and once we got that done, shake that down
show you guys what we got that’s we got
right there.
This is a really thickened mixture with a
coconut fiber.
We’re not going to use this mixture, we
need to do is extract all the coconut milk
out of this or cream in to a you know without
the fiber.
So I’m working at how I’m going to do
that.
Actually is I’m going to go ahead and use
the omega vsj843 juicer.
This is the best juicer I found for extracting
coconut milk because it works so easily.
We’re going to put sieve on here to make
sure we don’t get any fiber in the coconut
milk mixture because that’s going to change
the texture and put grit into our ice cream
which I don’t want the other thing you guys
could do if you don’t have one of these
juicers is you can actually just take a nut
milk bag and squeeze it out.
That’s a lot more messy and I’d rather
clean the juicer and clean a nelma bag and
u know milk my coconuts.
Alright let’s turn that baby on and we’re
going to go ahead and I’ll pour this in
a little bit at a time.
Look we got to get the counter there.
As u guys can see we pour this in.
We’re going to get on the way out right
there.
We’re going to get a really rich coconut
milk.
And as you guys can see over on this side
we’re getting just the fiber only.
And I really like that on this machine you
literally just pour this in an auto beads
and as you guys can see the rich milks coming
out and the fibers coming out on this side.
Super simple and super easy.
Alright so it looks like the omega vsj juicer
made quick work of extracting the coconut
milk and if I go ahead and take up some of
this pulp here and squeeze this, you guys
can see I’m not even squeezing any milk.
More milk out from my fingers.
So actually the vsj did quite an efficient
job at this task.
And this is the very way that I actually make
my own coconut milk out of coconut is using
the same technique to do that.
It’s a bit different.
I’ll add the coconut to the craft, then
I’ll fill it the carafe up to the 32 ounce
mark including the coconut.
That saris sitting in there that makes a nice
milk pretty much.
This time I play two coconuts and 24 ounces
of coconut water to make even a little bit
thicker ratio there.
And now we’re going to go ahead and shake
out this too to make sure we got all the delicious
milk in there.
Now maybe call this a milk but you know for
me I need to make a cream consistency right.
Milk is good for drinking.
You really want to have a higher level of
coconut fat in there.
If you are making an ice cream this might
be a bit too thin by the looks of it.
So if you’re going to do this recipe solely
using the two coconuts technique that I showed
you guys, you may want to reduce the amount
of liquid you actually put it into the blender.
I’m going to add something else to kind
of give it some more body here today.
So once you have this mixture, what you’re
going to do is a rinse out your blender crafts.
Already did that, so it doesn’t have any
leftover grit from the previous step.
We’re just going to go pour that in.
And then now we get to add the other ingredients.
So we’re going to go ahead and add the sixteen
dates here.I think these are some honey dates.
Dates are my sweetener of choice.
You know this is a whole food source of sugar.
Not only is there sugar in the dates, there’s
also a fiber, vitamins and minerals and other
phytonutrients.
And even things like the potassium, the dates
are higher potassium than even bananas, so
figure that one out and if you don’t have
dates, use some other kind of dried fruits.
Now if you use different kinds of dried fruit,
it may change the flavor of the recipe just
a little bit.
I do not advocate the use of any extracted
kind of sweeteners such as agave, nectar even
if it’s raw agave just squeeze gabby in
there.
It’s so easy John.
Well no man type it the dates and put it in
there because that’s a better source of
nutrients.
You know what I want to focus on whole food
nutrients, not extracted even if they’re
called raw, raw palm nectar, coconut nectar
or whatever kind of sure.
You all use I want you guys use real sources
of sweetness.
You know another one that I have used in the
past is freeze dried fruits that could get
kind of expensive but that’s like the ultimate
sweetener there.
Alright so the only other ingredients we’re
going to need to add our one whole vanilla
bean here and that’s once again I’m not
using vanilla extract extracted in alcohol
or glycerin or all this kind of stuff.
I use a whole real vanilla bean.
The vanilla beans I like are this brand right
here.
It’s the Tahitian gold ko at a Torrance
California.
Tahitian vanilla calm is the banette best
vanilla beans.
I found they’re really fragrant .They’re
nice and also these ones are raw.
Do you get the right variety, they sell many
different kinds of vanilla but I believe the
Tahitian variety they don’t need to be blanched
before they’re sun-dried, so they can be
considered truly wrong and you’re saying
John I got that vanilla.
Our man that stuff good.
nope.
According to my research, none of the vanilla
powders are raw despite staying on the lebel,
they’re lying tip, they need to have basically
a heat processing step to kill a microbial
growth that may occur due to the grinding
and all this kind of stuff.
So Tahitian gold vanilla beans definitely
might thumbs up.
So what we’re going to do is we’re going
to go ahead and instead of put this whole
vanilla bean in, we just basically chopped
it up into little pieces.
This will make a little bit easier work for
the blender to you know extract out all the
flavors And I’m not sitting here slicing
this in half and only squeezing out the middle.
The caviar which actually there’s quite
a lot of caviar in these Tahitian gold vanilla
beans because I want to use a whole food once
again.
I’m all into whole foods.
So you know this mixture right here.
Look at this!
You guys see a shake around that’s pretty
watery that’s not really going to get make
a good ice cream texture.
We need a little more thick.
So what I’m going to be adding today also
is the meat of one young coconut.
So this is a young coconut here and the meats.
A much more pliable and I would say silky
and this will give us some extra firmness
to our thick smoothie that we need for the
recipe also give us a little more body there
because we don’t want it too thin going
in because then you’re going to have more
of a like I don’t know sorbet without the
fat instead of like a nice rich delicious
ice cream.
Alright so once we got all these in there
we’re going to go ahead and hit that for
90 seconds and crank it up.
So once your blender is done blending, you
have a really nice consistency.
Here to be the consistency have a nice kind
of thick smoothie there.
And the next step is we got the ice cream
maker out, so this is actually the Delonghi
gelato machine and basically this is unlike
most ice cream makers you guys could buy.
A lot of the inexpensive ones have like a
little carafe thing you actually just put
inside the freezer or the bowl ,then you take
it out, you put it in the machine and the
bowl is frozen whenever you put in there you
know will be really cool.
Then they have a motor that spins.
it spins around a little paddle like this.
This is the better version because this actually
has a built-in compressor that is basically
just like your freezer in your house.
It basically chills the whole bowl and another
thing about this unit is actually has a stainless
steel bowl gotta watch out a lot of these
units actually have a Teflon coated bowl which
I do not recommend ,you know you could scratch
e Teflon coating off and it maybe getting
your food which I don’t think is definitely
a good thing.
And yeah so these work infinitely better than
one of the ones that you have you know that
you put the thing in the freezer and freeze
it these are the one that any work really
well for you guys also if you can’t afford.
One of these guys, these guys may run 150
tuner dollars or more depending on what model
and make you get.
Just make sure to check the reviews and make
sure it’s a good model.
But if it does regular ice creams, it will
do these raw vegan ice creams too so don’t
worry.
But I think I find that like you know having
a good cold temperature is really critical
to making a good ice cream that actually has
a nice consistency that’s not like to watery
and that’s why I don’t like making the
banana ice creams in the blender because it
whips it up too much.
It oxidizes it too much and that’s why I
prefer to do that in like a slow blender or
I mean a slow juicer rather.
Anyways I guess the trick with this we’re
just going to go ahead and take this mixture
pour it on in there.
And really important you don’t want to fill
it up to the top.
I like to just feel it maybe just a little
bit past halfway and we got a little bit of
extra batter here.
Maybe we’ll make a second batch later.
And we’re going to put the top on, close
this up and we’re going to go ahead and
turn the lever.
Lets see to chill cold and it does help if
you turn this on to the cold chill before
you actually even you put the stuff in there.
So I didn’t do that tonight.
But we’re just going to chill as it’s
running and it’s going to take a bit longer
for it to run.
So we’re just just gonna go ahead and set
up.
Basically what’s happening is it’s a reason
the container at the same time it’s rotating
iut.
So basically allowing the mixture to not just
like freeze be put it the freezer.
You know because it will just freeze like
an ice block but this actually keeps it aerated
and increased it up at a slower rate.
So if you actually don’t want to buy one
of these guys, you can kind of simulate this
kind of, if you take your mixture and put
it in a nice like stainless steel bowl in
your freezer and then I put it in there and
every five minutes take it out and stir it
a little bit and then put it back in there
and make sure you scrape down the sides that
way you could kind of do something like this.
But it’s definitely not the same and I’m
like my grandfather taught me to get the right
tool for the right job.
Anyway this is going to take some time, so
I thought I’d go ahead and put my stopwatch
on for you guys to see how long it took, And
I got some other stuff to do.
So we’re going to come back at you when
I’m done Hart done and ready to get out
all my raw vegan ice cream.
Alright so I think it’s about done.
We’re 46 minutes, so its definitely taking
a long time.
One of the things I like to do is actually
like to add a pretty cool ice cream maker
before I use it.
So actually as soon as I know I’m actually
gonna be making the ice cream in the blender
and starting the process, I’ll actually
plug this in and let it get cold first.
That’ll definitely reduce the time I think
in the past maybe it’s taken me maybe about
a half hour roughly.
Anyway you’ll hear the motor kind of laboring
a little bit.
It’ll kind of slow down a little bit.
That means it’s getting kind of thicker,
doesn’t kind of look in there and it’s
expanded a lot actually.
I probably overfilled it a little bit today.
But I want it to run long enough.
If you don’t let it run long enough, it’s
gonna be like a slush versus like a nice thick
raw vegan ice cream.
Alright so let’s go ahead and get some bowls
out here now an ice cream scoop.
Let’s see what we got.
Alright we’re gonna go ahead and pull this
out for you guys.
You guys can see that blue that raw vegan
ice cream upside down.
It doesn’t come out.
So we’re just going to go ahead and a scoop
in here.
Got a nice little ball.
Alright so this is what we got right there.
Now a moment of truth, go ahead and try it.
Definitely really good.
I think I like it better when I don’t put
the extra young coconut meat in there and
actually I reduce the amount of liquid going
in.
I think I had a little bit too much liquid
this time, so its not quite as good.
But every time little bit different.
So what I would recommend for you guys is
we take out the water of the coconuts that
you’re processing and just use the water
that’s contained within those two coconuts
and maybe add a tad bit more if you got it
but otherwise just those two waters you should
be good to go and make a nice thick Robin
cone ice cream.
I’m going to enjoy this and of course have
a baby with a girlfriend.
She loves it too oh and her sister my girlfriend.
I made this for my girlfriend sister who just
she doesn’t need raw vegan or anything or
even vegan .She just, he’s wearing an ice
cream, drinks coke on the regular stuff right
and she said this tastes like real ice cream.
Well the time that I made it for her.
Anyways so if yeah if it won her heart over
, it’ll definitely win your guys’ hearts
over and any your friends or family members
that don’t necessarily eat raw or vegan.
You could dazzle them with this ice cream
that just tastes just like the real thing.
I guess that’s it for today’s episode.
