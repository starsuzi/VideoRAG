- Welcome to the internet, fam!
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
- Chocolate might be one of
the greatest human achievements
in history, therefore the next step
in our evolution is, of
course, human chocolate.
That's why we're gonna turn Link
into a human chocolate fountain!
- I'm not quite following the logic here.
- Doesn't matter, it's time for
the Human Chocolate Fountain Challenge.
Link, before we get started,
do I have your consent
to turn you into a human
chocolate fountain?
- You have it.
- Oh, wow, okay.
Now, we have the chocolate
fountain, but we need a statue.
That's where you come in.
- Take my glasses.
Nothing like a good morph
suit in the morning.
- Should be a face hole.
Great.
I gotta route this tube.
- Oh!
- Past your butt and all
the way down your leg.
- Ooh, you going doing
the left leg I feel!
- You want me to go down the right leg?
- It doesn't matter.
- Pick a leg!
- Just as long as you don't
go down the middle. (laughs)
- Almost got it.
- Did the hose breach?
- Yes, we breached!
- Pull it!
- Now I'm gonna lock it in.
- Goggles on.
(laughing)
- It kinda looks like I
may be pushing your eyes
further back into your head, is it okay?
You're gonna have goggle marks for days.
- Oh, it's tight.
- We're gonna get you
to climb right up here,
and step into the fountain, ready?
- Roger, roger.
- Take a step.
- Okay.
- Now step right in the middle.
- You already got some chocolate in there.
Oh yeah!
I'm a statue, get it?
- You feel stable?
- Am I decent?
Is my fig leaf big enough?
- First we gotta get the
whole fountain working,
just get the motion and
the ocean going down here,
so let's turn that on.
- Fondue it!
Whoa!
- Okay, nice, that's real nice.
- Whoa, oh, oh.
- It's like a bidet that does exactly
the opposite of what it should do.
(laughs)
- That's called a bi-don't.
- We are going to activate the head.
- Oh goodness!
Is it raining in here or
is it just me as a chocolate fountain?
- Oh, wow.
- Look at me, I'm David.
Have you seen this one?
- [Rhett] Oh, that's real nice. Yeah.
- I'm thinking.
- I got a little chocolate on myself.
Mmm.
- This is amazing!
This is freaking chocolate amazing!
Oh, it's a Twinkie, didn't see that.
- Do you want a Twinkie?
(audience laughs)
Let me get a little pineapple.
- This is great for weddings.
But you know what?
This fountain actually has another feature
that you haven't yet experienced.
Let's turn that on.
- What's that noise?
- Oh, you're about to find out.
(laughs)
Yeah, Link.
- Woo!
Look at me dad!
I made it!
- Alright, I hate to ask you do it
but can you pee into my mouth?
- Take a knee, son.
Nothing wrong with this!
Welcome to the internet, fam!
(laughs)
I win the internet today
or at least for the next two minutes.
- I've never felt closer to you.
(laughs)
Well, there you have it, quite possibly
one of humanity's greatest and
most delicious achievements
right here on this show
and I have no regrets about it whatsoever.
