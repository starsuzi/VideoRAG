's a fun time of year
you get all kinds of surprises so I'm
going to give you some tips on how to
get this off quickly and then also show
you how to get it off of the
vinyl tube so a lot of people ask us
what solution we use to keep it very
simple we used cold water not warm water
and see how much we have in the bucket
not very much and then we're just going
to go ahead
and put in just a little bit of Dawn and
that's all we're going to use okay so we
got all the egg on the glass we're just
going to use our five-step cleaning
process
oh it's so gross
now the egg is not going to come off all
by itself so instead of us trying to use
elbow grease to get it off we just have
a nice razor blade
just make sure the glass is really wet
and then we just start scraping it off
[Music]
you want to use as much water as
possible
[Music]
because there's a lot of grossness on
this glass
[Music]
then we're going to wet it again
we're actually going to scrape it again
because I know I didn't get it all off
the first time because egg is the most
difficult of all the substances you'll
find on glass to clean off
foreign
all right so we've got the glass all the
egg off the glass
next step is to
we need to start getting all the egg off
of the vinyl now to the vinyl we want to
be really careful because obviously we
don't want to scratch up the vinyl
okay so for the vinyl we're going to use
a steel wool and this is important to
notice we're using the four zeros
the reason why we use it is it's
extremely fine you can use this on glass
so if you don't want to use a razor
blade you can use a steel wool uh you
don't have to worry about scratching the
glass we're going to do the same thing
on the vinyl so this should help protect
the vinyl we may still get some sub
scratches but what else you're going to
do you have to get the egg off so just
like with the glass I like to make sure
it's nice and wet
and I just get here with a steel wool
then it's starting to come off nice and
easily
and what's nice is
the vinyl if you notice there's no vinyl
coming off of my fingers so we're not
scratching up the vinyl where if you use
a wire brush this vinyl will start to
get scratched up and it'll start you'll
leave marks on your finger so I'm going
to go ahead and
use a steel wool this may take a while
because it takes a little bit longer
than using the razor blade so what we're
going to do is pause and then we'll come
back after I get all the egg off of the
vinyl we went ahead use a steel wool get
the vinyl clean so I'm just going to use
the towel just to wet it down rinse it
off and that can be really worried about
you know putting a squeegee on it just
because it'll dry naturally we don't
worry about streaks on the vinyl go
ahead and we wet the glass
foreign
Ty down in this particular case
get it off
make sure I don't have any other egg
there and then I'm just going to do
touch up
I have a line for where my squeegee on
the edge
normally I would do it side to side so
we wouldn't have that problem but not a
big deal
all right so we'll take a look at it
really quick
all right so
before
after
our vinyl is nice and clean
there we go
this is my brother's house so now it's
time for me to go ahead and clean the
other window I promised I would you
