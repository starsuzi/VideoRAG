back and I'm going to show you how to
roll the mixture in your hand and make
the little lows just what I call it and
get them ready for frying put a little
cold water in the hand
it keeps the mixture from sticking to
your hand I'm going to roll out enough
to get them all in pretty much at the
same time so that none will get done
faster than the others will be able to
get them all out at the same around
second period of time okay I think we're
about ready now for our first section to
go into the frying pan so let's take a
break
