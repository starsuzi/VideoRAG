today we're gonna bake
the famous jamaican coconut bread
our cake total so we start with
three cups of flour
one and a half cup of brown sugar
and i mix this around before i add the
other stuff
then the next thing to add is the
desiccated coconut or freshly grated
coconut
one and a half cup
and it's unsweetened dessicated coconut
and now for the spices here i have a
teaspoon of ground ginger
half a teaspoon of allspice half a
teaspoon of
nutmeg and half a teaspoon of salt
that this is
quite easy and quick
and i have to use your electric
apparatus for this
this is manual
and then i had a half a cup of raisins
which is optional
when i was growing up there was no
raisin in it this is my doing
here i have three teaspoons of baking
powder
and one teaspoon of baking soda
which i should have put in earlier
next step is

okay folks in this bowl i have two eggs
milk and melted butter all whipped up
together
and now i'm adding a little
a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon
of
white rum

they don't get this in the original this
is my my thing
so this is all blended in and it's time
to add it to the
dry ingredients and as soon as the flour
gets blended in it's good it's
