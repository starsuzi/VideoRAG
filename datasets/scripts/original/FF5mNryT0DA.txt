hello everyone and welcome back to my
Channel today I am going to be making
something very very proteinous so today
I'll be making the black ey pea beans
but in a Nigerian way so please sit back
and relax and enjoy bye so the first
process in making this
is to soak the beans in
water this is probably about
um one cup or 1 and 1/2 cups so this is
the only one I have today I'm going to
just be making with this quantity so if
um if I had known that I'll be making
this I would have soaked this beans
since last night or probably this
morning since I woke up
but it didn't come to my mind or I
thought of it yesterday but then I
forgot so this morning I remembered it
again uh to make it so the first process
is to soak it in
water because I'll be making it because
I didn't remember it on time I will just
be soaking it for 30 minutes so after I
soak it for 30 minutes we will get back
to making
it now um I'm ready to put the
beans and the
[Music]
partt I wash it
out I put in the pot I don't know why I
always like to use an oversized pot I
think it just
um just helps to keep the whole thing
inside the part and not let it Splash
everywhere
[Music]
so I take got all the
[Music]
beans then I add
onions just put them in place them in
like this the reason why it's so big big
is because I'll have to take it out at
the end of the cooking I got
you I'll be using two stock
cubes please anyone if you think the
stock cube is too much don't judge me
please um this is just my
style you can use as little or as much
as um one it depends on individual's
Choice like I always
say I add creay
fish I like to add just a little I don't
know the quantity but
so we add water
[Music]
you need a lot of water cuz beans takes
um a long time to
cook and I don't want to be opening it
from time to time so I'm just going to
cover it like this and just put it on
the stove and let it cook until it
softens cover
it now it goes on the St so I think I'm
just going to put this on high and let
it boil first then when it starts
boiling very well I then take it to
medium
High cover the beans let it cook I'll
show you guys when it starts boiling so
this is how the beans looks when it is
boiling
it's not soft yet it's soft but not as
soft as a one I want it to be very very
cook and
soft so we cover it and let it cook so
everyone here it is the beans is all um
dried off and ready to be mixed
although I had to add a little bit more
water cuz the first one was not enough
to cook uh the beans
true so now let's go into the mixing
process so the next process now is to
prepare the whole thing and mix it
together now I'll cut up my
onions I'm using the remaining half of
the onion side put in the beans before
cooking it this is remaining half of it
meanwhile the beans I turned it into
another Bowl so I can fry my onions and
the
oil okay just a recap of the whole
process so I soaked these beans in the
water in a cold water for 30 minutes and
then I brought it out and put in a pot I
added
onions EG stock Cube and little C fish
sometimes I do add garlic some cloves of
smashed cloves of garlic but today I
forgot the garlic so you add those
things and you add water enough water to
cook the beans for a long time then you
put it on the stove after you have
cooked it for about an hour 30 minutes
or sometimes more than that you bring it
down if when the beans is soft enough
like this the beans is very very soft
now you can press it with your hand and
smash the whole thing so you bring it
down and turn the beans into a separate
bowl cut up your
[Music]
onions after you cut up the onions you
put the pot back in the
stove now I'm just going to add my red
oil I didn't know I was out so this is
the last one this is the red oil I'm
using AJ Palam oil I got this from
um from from an Asian store
here so I have to go get another one
this one is finished so now the oil is
on the stove I just let it um heat
up you don't have to fry the oil or
anything you don't have to let it change
color just heat it up and add your
onions now the oil is heated
up just going to add my onions
[Music]
I'll just let the O onions cook a little
bit and turn
brown meanwhile now it's time to add my
pepper
[Music]
I'm using a ground dry
pepper this is mostly for my kids so I'm
not going to be adding too mucher I
think this is even too
much so I'll add something like this so
they'll be able to eat it
[Music]
I like to fry the onions longer in the o
no I think the beans is ready to
go I actually found this style of
cooking beans on
YouTube I I found it on this other
channel I think it was um Nigerian food
recipes or Nigerian recipes so I found
it there and I tried it and um it worked
out very well for me everybody in my
family likes uh beans now so I just
started making it like this in that uh
video I think the woman called it
Nigerian fried
beans so
uh it is very good
just try it you like it it might look
unusual but I bet you and I tell you it
tastes very good so now I'll add
salt depends on the quantity of the
beans you're
making after I add this one I'll tast it
to know or to see
um if it is enough if it's not enough
I'll add
more just try this at home I'm all
for easy and simple food recipes so this
is very easy and simple for
me there is no stress just cook the
beans when it's done fry your onions in
the oil and mix it up
[Music]
yes the salt is is okay now so I am not
going to be adding any more
salt I'll turn this stove very very low
now and cover it up to so that all the
ingredients get to soak um in the
beans so everyone this is my beans my
black IP the Nigerian style so if you
