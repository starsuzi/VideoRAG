come on guys rich here back another
video with that one extra and today I'm
going to show you guys how I clean my
offseason WeatherTech mats as you can
see here they're a little bit great beat
it out so I'm just going to clean them
up and show you how I break the black
color back to these mats so stay tuned
so as you can see here the mat is a
little bit dirty a little bit faded a
little bit greyed out we're gonna try to
bring the black color back the products
I'm using today are gree OHS interior
cleaner and VRP dressing by Chemical
Guys I'm also going to use this medium
stiff bristled brush it's kind of brush
the map and agitate some of that dirt so
I'll show you how we do it
get rid of any heavy dirt
my math is not adapter is just Logan
grade
see here
that's what it looked like when I came
straight from weathertech
that's what it looks like right now so
what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to
get the black backs this back so
[Music]
okay guys so now that we've got a
mountain spring down a lot of the heavy
dirt is avocado so we're gonna go ahead
with our interior cleaner and we're just
gonna soak that let the tears be Network
it's magic you see not many of the terms
of people to even premises there and
then we're gonna go in with our brush
and I take the rest
so I'll show you
[Music]
- Matt let it sit for a little bit what
to do and then you want the brush just
get it
corners basically the whole net
that's not
[Music]
rushed up as you can see the interior
Peter was doing its the work looks like
it kicked them what's the dirt so we're
gonna go ahead can you guys for the most
part everything is starting to dry up
but it's still not as black as I would
like it so our next step here is to go
in with the applicator pad with Chemical
Guys as VRP jesse and that should finish
it off give this matte black
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so much better than before but I'll show
you the other mess just for comparison
snake clean papers over here I have a
side-by-side comparison
when we cleaned up with the driver side
to passenger side this is the driver
side had a little bit more where to air
the passenger side
noticeably big difference back to its
black finish passenger side here
dull dirty almost liken to create out so
yeah thanks for watching guys like
comment subscribe share the video if you
know someone a need to clean up their or
WeatherTech mat or
for that matter and yeah I will see you
guys in the next
