Now we'll cut the pipe. This is a tube cutter,
it's a heavy duty tube cutter. I've got a
small one for a small pipe that I use on a
smaller one. This here is from a cyclone fence.
This is the center post and not a corner post.
Corner post I had, I had two from the corner
post. But I don't have enough to make five.
This is all I have. But I can make these other
ones. I also make them out of the top railing,
which is smaller pipe. Whatever I can find
is what I use. If you don't have a tube cutter,
let me show you what I have. This is another
way you can cut or you can use a hacksaw which
I quit using hacksaws quite a few years back.
I still have a couple of them in a bag. But
this one here is a lot easier to cut. But
it doesn't leave a smooth cut like the tube
cutter does. Okay, here we go. I made the
mistake of not putting my big blade on it,
I got a short one. But I can still cut it
because all I have to do is move it around.
Like I say you can use a hacksaw but you don't
want to do that, I don't. Here we go, right
there.
