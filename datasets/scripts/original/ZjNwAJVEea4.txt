Namaste welcome to sisas kitchen.com
today I'm making tomato
[Music]
pickle this pickle can be done in
different
steps I have 2 lbs of Fresh Garden
Tomatoes The juicy tomatoes are best for
the pickle not the salad Tomatoes half a
cup of pink Himalayan
salt turmeric
powder cut the tomatoes into small
pieces take them into a glass botle or a
[Music]
jar add pink Himalayan salt to tomato
pieces also add about 2 tbsp of turmeric
powder take a clean and dry spoon and
mix them
well when everything is mixed well cover
it and let it sit for about 48 hours
which is 2
days on the third day we will go to the
next
step on the third day you will notice a
lot of of juice came out of
tomatoes now squeeze the Tomato pieces
with your hand and spread them on a
plate leave out the juice in the
jar put these squeezed tomato pieces
Under the Sun for about 2 or 3 days
until they are completely dry if you
don't have full sun you can dry them in
your oven turn on the oven to its lowest
temperature and put the Tomato pieces in
your oven keep an eye and stir them in
between so that they don't get black or
brown you just want them to get crispy
this is 250 g of Tamarind block I'm
going to use half of it which will be
125 G remove the seeds and tough fibers
now soak this Tamarind in the tomato
juice allow The Tamarind to soak in the
tomato juice until your tomato pieces
are ready
if you are drying your tomatoes in the
Sun for 2 or 3 days make sure you stir
the Tamarind on the next day so that
there won't be any white layer forming
on the surface don't worry it doesn't
happen usually unless you have less salt
in your tomato juice because salt acts
as a preservative here I soaked my
Tamarind in the tomato juice for 2 days
now I'm going to make a fine paste out
of it
here is the ground paste of Tamarind and
tomato juice now keep this
aside let us move on to the next step
dry roast penric seeds until they have
nice Aroma as you can see I already dry
roasted the mustard seeds the same way
when they are done allow them to cool
down and then make a fine powder I
ground vric seeds and mustard seeds into
a fine powder I have 1 cup of red chili
powder the Tomato pieces are dried out
completely make sure there is no
moisture now add the spice powders to
Tamarind mixture mustard powder fenri
powder and red chili powder this pickle
tastes like minaya a kind of mango
pickle because I'm using more penri
powder add the tomato pieces also some
people like to grind the Tomato pieces
along with Tamarind if you like you can
do that mix them well
the next step is going to be tempering
the Tomato pickle first of all fry the
garlic in
oil transfer the fried garlic into
tomato
pickle to the same oil add Ur
do
Chad mustard
seeds and cumin seeds
add three or four red
chilies add 1/4 taspo of
Hing and few Curry
leaves now bring down the temperature to
low flame and add the prepared tomato
pickle to the tempering
mix it well again bring up the
temperature to low medium flame and stir
it for a couple of minutes and then
switch off the flame it actually helps
to remove any slight moisture in the
pickle if the oil is not enough you can
heat up some more oil and add it to the
pickle the oil has to float on the
surface of the pickle otherwise there is
a chance of it getting spoiled store it
in a clean and dry glass bottle so our
tomato pickle is ready try this recipe
