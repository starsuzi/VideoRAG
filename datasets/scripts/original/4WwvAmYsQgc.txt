hey what's up YouTube I'm going to show
you guys a quick and easy way of making
chicken Bruth and I'm going to use
chicken parts that's not traditional so
here are some
drumsticks I was going to cook them for
dinner so I just decided to just boil
them because I have to use it in a dish
I'm going to prepare tomorrow which
involves using the uh the uh crackpot
and a rabbit all right so I needed some
chicken broth all right so in a pot of
water bring it to Boiling Point add some
garlic and ginger so here I have four
slices of Ginger add that and three
garlic which I cut in have to make you
know to bring out the uh flavor of it
all right and now just add my chicken
now the reason I'm not going to add oil
is because the chicken skin has plenty
of fat you know from the fat and oil
that it
generates so I'll just put that in there
and make sure you don't add too much
water where it overflows while it's
boiling all right oh this might be a
little bit too much but all right far is
enough all right
so I'll just keep it at
a medium temperature
setting and we just weigh this slowly
boil and then I'm going to add a little
bit of
salt not too much because you have to
remember the broth you going use it in
other dishes where you going add more
salt to it so you don't want to be too
salty so that's
enough all right so we just wait until
it comes to bril boil and there you have
your chicken broth which you can use for
soup and
other add
dishes so in case you're wondering how
come I'm using it in a different pot I
decided to use a
bigger pot or Skillet so I can
compensate for the additional
drumstick and also I can have more
chicken Bruff all right so we're going
to cook this at
a four to five setting on the range for
about 50
minutes so make sure you bring out all
the you know natural chicken flavor and
the ginger and the garlic so the reason
why I put those is that it it adds
additional
sweetness to the chicken flavoring and
it's perfect
for cooking or
just drinking like soup
eating I mean chicken broth is like the
most basic soup you can
make all right so the chicken broth is
ready I've been cooking this for
about 40 to 45
minutes here I have the chicken
drumsticks taken out so one thing to
keep in mind is when you're cooking
making chicken
broth it's not necessarily you have to
use the whole
chicken you can use any of the chicken
part you just want to bring out the
chicken flavor all right so we have some
of the chicken broth here I'm going to
taste it and see how it tastes I know it
doesn't look that pleasant but trust me
it tastes
good
ah I taste of
sweetness natural chicken flavor this is
what chicken broth is supposed to taste
like without paying for it or for my
can easy to make perfect to make
soups and
other
meals really
easy
