hi I'm Jeremiah Stone I'm Fabian fun
house and we're from Contra and wild
there in New York City uh we're going to
fry some squid right now and what we
have here is the body and the tentacles
of the squid we have slices of lemon
that have been deceit couple pieces of
young onions uh we have masara flour and
we have a wet batter made with masara
potato starch a little bit of water and
baking powder so the first thing you
want to do is you want to take a couple
of t I Les and about eight pieces of the
body of the squid couple slices of
lemon and a couple a pie of onion uh you
want to make sure you cover them in the
flour completely you have to make it a
little dry so that the batter will stick
a bit so after it goes into the dry Mas
up of flour we going to take everything
and put it into our wet patter
[Music]
so you want to make sure that everything
is completely covered in the wet batter
and from there you go straight into the
deep fryer want to hold it uh just in
the oil at the top just for a moment
just so it can fry a bit without sinking
to the bottom and that way it won't
stick when it uh goes in the
fryer it only takes about a minute and a
half for everything to start um floating
and developing start pulling out
the lemons first so they don't burn and
then the squid and the onions I'm using
Chopsticks to pull them out but you can
also use a spider just to scoop
everything out whatever you feel more
comfortable with and it's important that
right after it comes out of the fry
while it's still warm uh to season it so
when you salt it when it comes out then
it's all going to inhere to your fried
uh pieces a lot better
and that's our squid
