Hey guys! Welcome back :D
Today we are pitting KFC's Extra Crispy and Original Recipe fried chicken against each other in an ear-to-ear crunch off!
[ Original Recipe ]
[ Extra Crispy ]
Let's eat!!
Before we start, you can take the first bite of the Original Recipe :)
So good! KFC isn't the best imo, but still it never disappoints
First bite of the Extra Crispy goodness is all yours
Is one more satisfying than the other? Let me know in the comments!
I think I prefer the taste of the Original Recipe over the Extra Crispy
Thanks for watching! <33 See ya next time!
