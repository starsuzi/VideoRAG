hi guys this is Jackie and I decided I
was going to show you something that I
cook for dinner someone asked me to do a
tutorial who came over my house and
actually ate this so I decided that I'd
do a tutorial and let you see a simple
yet tasty um entree that you can cook at
home for next to nothing the first thing
we'll be using is a little bit of garlic
garlic powder that's going to be pretty
much your B of uh seasoning we're going
to be using BR worst this BR is
a sweet BR word sometimes I use the
cheesy the one with the cheese in the
middle but today we're going to be using
sweet and also a medley of uh freshly
chopped green bell pepper red bell
pepper and yellow bell pepper and then
we're going to be using some red
potatoes so the first thing I'm going to
do is chop the red potatoes and put them
into the bell pepper and add about two
tablespoons of butter so stay
tuned these have been washed previously
so no need to uh show you how I wash
potatoes and yes I do keep them keep the
skin on because that is where all the
vitamins and the nutrients are in the
potatoes okay now that I have my
potatoes chopped I'm going to add about
two
tablespoon of butter to the
potato and the bell pepper once I'm done
with that I'm going to
add some garlic powder and then I'm
simply going to mix this up and put it
in the microwave for about five or
excuse me 10 minutes so once your
potatoes are done cooking simply stir
them up to determine whether or not you
have a good consistency and your bell
peppers are nice and soft you don't want
your potatoes too soft and you don't
want them too hard because they will
continue cooking in the oven
so next I will add a little bit of
crushed black
pepper as well
as just a little
sea
salt and parsley I don't measure because
I put it in according to
taste then I stir it up
again and I let it
sit while my potatoes were cooking I put
in approximately 2 tblspoon of of olive
oil I have a little spray bottle here
that I fill up with olive olive oil to
help me evenly distribute it throughout
the Pan Once the pan is hot then I put
in my BR wordss but before I do that I
make sure that my oven is on 350 to
375Â° I decided to go with 300 75 350 or
375 it really doesn't matter now that
the pan is hot simply add your BR work
and you want to be Browning them not
cooking them
thoroughly
okay now that the BRS are brown on both
side in the pan I take us the rated
knife and proceed to cut
them once I've cut all of my
BRS I simply transfer them back to The
Frying Pan Once the BR all have been cut
simply
take them and put them back into
the frying
pan make sure you wash your hands after
you've done this because you're touching
raw meat and you don't want to cross
contaminate your
food stir your blocks a little bit you
don't want to completely over cook them
cuz you you might run the risk of
overcooking
them you're just trying to get them a
little bit of burn Brown and caramelize
the reason why I brown the BRS before I
cut them is because it makes the skin
hold together and easy easier to
cut once you have a nice little brown
consistency to most of your bro go
ahead and apply your potato
mixture
mixing it up like
so remember the oven that was on 375 the
next thing you're going to
do is put your
cheese in with your potatoes and put it
into a stone and then put it in the
oven okay now the brought and potato is
Thoroughly mixed I'm going to Simply put
it into my cooking Stone
make sure you turn off your
burner mixing it up very well in my
cooking Stone and then I'm going to
apply
approximately one
cup of shredded
cheese yes I am not measuring once
again mix it up
thoroughly
[Music]
and then you can
apply a little bit more parsley if you
like that is simply your
choice I used to
have a Stone cover for this but my kids
broke it so I've been forced to use
aluminum oil it
does the same
trick and then insert it in the
oven and set your
timer for about 30
minutes
once your Italian sausage and potatoes
are done is now it's time to eat you can
pair it with a fresh
bread and vegetables because you already
have your carbs as well as your meat
included in your potato
mixture a bone
