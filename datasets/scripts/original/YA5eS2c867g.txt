hello this is a boot route called
perfect
3 I so these seeds about 3 week
ago um by the looks of things we've got
some really good germination going on
here um we've only got seed leaves at
the moment we haven't got any true
leaves but I'm going to try and plant
these guys up anywhere I want to try and
get them out in the garden uh um before
the roots get too entangled in this
small
container uh soil's nice and moist it's
a reasonable day today the sun's not out
uh and I will put some cover over them
to keep the birds off cuz I did lose a
lot of um bir Ro sings last year the SP
was
um so we'll take those up the garden and
we'll try and get them out of this
container without doing too much damage
let's go
[Music]
the Pucket tells me that these guys need
to be 4 in
apart and in rows one ft
apart well when you're in an alotment
that's fine you've got lots of space you
can do that um but I'm in raised beds
I've only got three and they're all just
about full now so I'm going to try and
squeeze two rows in to one rais bed
instead of a foot apart we'll make the
rows 6 in
apart uh but we'll retain the 4in
spacing how does that
sound and for that I think I need about
30 of these guys out of
here uh so let's see if we can get them
out without making too big a
mess and once they are out of course I
will need to work fairly quickly because
the to dry out once the roots are
exposed so we'll need to crack on with
this once we get
[Music]
started how's that you see those
root hopefully they're not rot bound
we'll soon find out when we try and
break them
out let's do these guys
first and we'll put this back in the
container if we can
how's
that
okay let's see what we've got here
four very small Boot
Road
okay and I'll tell you what we'll do
we'll wet this slate put some
water just so that these
guys they in contact with a way bit of
moisture while they're uh been
[Music]
Disturbed okay I think I've actually got
enough here to do one raow so I think
what we'll do is
um we'll pop down the garden we'll saw
this one
raow uh and that should be enough for
this video I'll show the second RW video
or off camera should I say and then
perhaps just include it later on okay we
leave these guys
here and we'll show down the garden come
on
this board's 5 in
wide no it
isn't this board 6 in
wide I'm going to use the board to draw
a
line each side of
it so I get two RWS 6 in apart and then
we'll use this plant marker which is
exactly 4 in long to space our breed
through and also what I'm going to do is
in each of these rows I'm going to
drizzle in some
6X and some blood fishing Bard and that
should make us uh that should make the
line easier to
see okay let's move everything on the
way let's see that looks
like perhaps you can't see those lines
as well as I can uh but there are two
lines maybe when we get some of this
stuff in they'll stand out to be
better so the two functions here with
this 6X and um blood fish and born wants
to give the
beetro a little bit of
nourishment uh but secondly so that you
can see the line or so that I can see
the line so I know where I'm planting
stuff I bet that's a little better
[Music]
[Music]
um right duck seed
okay we'll do the raw nearest the camera
first cuz I think that's probably the
one you're seeing better
okay
let's po some of these guys
in in fact no we will what we'll do is
see when you're at Gardener you can
change plans all the
time CU we're on this side we'll work on
this side I
think um we won't go shooting around
just to
complete the
rock this is a about as far as I can
reach stop falling into the
bed you would love
that fall into this
bed
right um there Two's A little bit of
soil up around these
guys can you hear the black bird or the
traffic
noise um
I didn't actually realize how many I had
how many of these seedings are
germinated on I started breaking them
out today and I've had a tremendous
germination I really
have
um so let's go back and get these guys
to kick on and produce beetro I'll be
dead Chuy to do even if only half of
them do I'll be dead
Chu what we going to
do after we finish planting those
as I've said the sp's got quite a lot of
my we load last year we're not getting
any this year cuz I've got a cly plan
and as usual it involves mushroom
crates hey we love our very C at you
can't get enough of it all a quick G
ring as I say that the soil is quite uh
moist
so I'm okay with this
and I will keep on top of them if the
weather does get warm I will get out and
give them a
drink and this is how we're going to
keep the spatters off just like this
okay that's two rows of be rout
on um we'll take another another look at
these guys in a couple of weeks time
shall we see how they're getting
on um and I have a feeling I might saw
some of these guys in pots as well
because they have got a lot of sea beins
left a lot more than they
expected okay two weeks time it is
when I planted those boat Ro seedlings
three work
ago um I planted two rows 6 in apart
although the recommended spacing was 12
in because I'm in a raised bed I closed
that up um so there's two rows 6 in
apart and I planted the side
Lanes 4 in apart as recommended
uh but since then because I'd had such
good germination of the
seedlings um I decided to revisit these
two Roars and add some more seedling so
they're now only 2 in
apart uh but
nevertheless what that means is uh I
will not need to thin out these two
RWS of bre Ro let's take a quick look
let's have a look at them
I hope you can see that when these guys
went in they only had the two uh seed
leaves they didn't have any proper
leaves but as you can see now awfully uh
we have proper
leaves take another
off
um and we'll pop around the other side
and take the last one off
all the seedlings look as though they'
taken there doesn't seem to be any gaps
in the rows so we're quite pleased with
that
um now as I've already said because of
the way I've planted these guys because
I pre germinated
seedlings uh I've been able to space
them out and there will be no need for
any further
thinning now I posted a video some time
ago uh that you might be interested in
it's called beetroot seed cluster
experiment uh prefixed by
hgv and it's a start to finish
video what it'll actually show you is
that if you were to use the uh normal
method of sewing just put your boot root
seeds in
there you'll find that the RWS of boot
root are much thicker than you would
have expected and that's because you
haven't planted boot root seeds you've
planted boot root
clusters what what is termed a boot root
seed isn't in fact a boot root seed it's
a cluster of boot root seeds so for
every one you put
in you may get 1 2 3 four boot rout
growing from that one cluster in that
one location so then you have one two or
three to pull out to thin them
out uh it's such a simple experiment you
may want to try it yourself uh but I
would recommend you watch that video
first and it's just it's it's so simple
so simple and you'll prove to yourself
um that when you've SE bir before you
haven't actually been heavy-handed you
haven't over sewn
them um there are just more seeds in the
cluster that you know um but check the
video
[Music]
out right let's zoom in on these guys
and and and see if we can get a closer
look see what they look like
hope you can see these These are true
leaves when I first put these beetroot
in all we had was two seed
leaves um but these guys have kicked on
now and as you can see you know it's
about 2 in it's about 2 in isn't it 2 in
between each uh each seedling um so
we're happy with
that
um now then what we're going to do now
always put these spent mushroom crates
back on because these have provided a
dual
function these bir Road sings they've
kept the birds off and they've kept the
wind off they've broke the wind up so
the sings haven't had the full force of
the wind and there's been some wind
lately um but last year I lost a lot of
these seedlings to spatters I might have
mentioned that on the first part of this
video but I haven't lost any this year
and I haven't lost any because I've used
used these spent mushroom
crates uh to protect the
seedlings uh and because they've got OES
in there there's lots of light gets in
there so the sings are not short of
light uh and when it rains the sings get
a drink so everybody's
happy okay this is homegrown
veg signing out
