here we have just a regular tomato
regular hot house
tomato
and you could remove the the core with a
paring knife
i find it's easier to just chop the top
off
which
you'll get more yield off that later
from here you can get
wedges
for salads
but not
four quarters
came out of that
you can just break that down further
in the salad wedges
sometimes you'll need to remove the
the pulp and seeds out you just use a
paring knife
and just go right along
the outer wall of the tomato
and discard that it's called a dry
concha say
we'll go over
regular concoct later
so you have these
pieces of tomato they've been seated
from here you can cut strips
quite easily
these pieces lay flat so
turn those 90 degrees
and make cuts across those
you have diced tomato
small dice you can make large dice if
you need to
now this top piece you don't want to
just discard this
tomatoes can be expensive
heirloom variety in particular
so you go ahead and just
cut around
the stem
that piece is discarded
add that to the dice
so you can see it's
close to 100 yield
if you use that top piece
there you have it
