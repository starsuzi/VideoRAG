- When I find a deep scratch
in my paint, I lose my mind.
They're annoying to look
at, expensive to repair,
and open up your paint
to future rust problems
if left untreated.
Today, we're gonna walk
you through the steps
to cosmetically repair that deep scratch,
on this episode of Details.
My name is Larry Casilla, and
I'm a professional detailer.

Here are the items you'll
need for this task.

For the purposes of this demonstration,
I'll be working on a
scrap panel hood I use
to practice compounding
and polishing techniques.
First, I'll use a screwdriver
to mimic the damaged
caused by a tree branch,
shopping cart or bicycle handle.
These scratches are usually
deep and require more
than just a simple touch-up.
To start, clean out the
scratch with rubbing alcohol
to remove any leftover wax,
especially if the gouge
occurred after a recent
wax or sealant session.
Due to the severe depth of the scratch,
touch-up will not be
effective nor efficient
when filling in the crater.
For this, a glazing spot putty
will fill the void or crater
before applying touch-up
on top of the dry putty.
Squeeze a bit of putty
next to the scratch,
then use a small squeegee
to spread the putty
into the scratch and
allow the glaze to dry
for two to three minutes.
Once dry, wrap a shop towel
around a foam wet sanding block,
and apply liquid paint
leveler to the towel.
The leveler will remove the
putty surrounding the scratch,
but leave the excess
putty within the scratch.
Gently wipe the towel across the putty
to remove small sections at a time.
Use light pressure as the
goal is to leave the scratch
full of putty and it may take you
a few minutes to get this done properly.
When done, the scratch should
look like a thin red line
the length of the original damage.
Next, use touch-up paint
from your dealership
or specialized online retailers
and a very fine brush.
Apply the paint to the
red putty by dabbing,
not brushing or wiping.
Cover the area with a thin, light coat
and allow it to dry over night.
If more touch-up if required,
add one more thin coat
or simply apply clear coat on
top of the dry touch-up paint.
The main purpose of touch-up,
especially for deep scratches
is to protect the paint from
future corrosion, however,
if done correctly, the
by-product of this process
cosmetically makes the scratch
less annoying to look at.
