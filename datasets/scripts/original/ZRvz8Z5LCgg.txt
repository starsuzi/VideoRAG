hi everybody this is Tim and I'm in
Steve Carmichael's Workshop okay well my
face is on the computer um we've done a
four-part uh project here it started
with me and then we moved it on over to
SAI at Si's corner and then over to
Steve and we've got Steve Sarah Charlie
and Sai all in Georgia without me oh
well and part four is going to be over
with Sarah and Charlie slovan
Farms so we hope you enjoy all four
parts make sure to watch them check the
links below and enjoy the
[Applause]
[Music]
project so we're going to start off this
project by cutting out um the top and
bottom pieces the actual parts that are
going to be doing the pressing of the
wood and I was lucky enough to get my
hands on this piece of mahogany so um
it's 78 7 and 1/8 in wide going go ahead
and leave that width I'm going to cut
out uh two pieces that are about 13 1/2
in Long a little longer than what we're
going to be doing but we can trim it
down when we get closer to
that so the next thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to cut down um rough size
on the vertical pieces um and the
horizontal top
[Music]
piece okay I'm going to rip these down
to about 2
[Music]
in we're going to be cutting some pieces
down to an inch and 3/4 width
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
okay underside of the piece that we're
mounting into the frame I'm going to put
some pocket holes in it
[Music]
okay so we got the main pieces cut out
we've got our top and bottom part of the
press these pieces are going to
be see if I can put them together right
that will be the base that this goes
on and our cross piece so I'm going to
stop right now and do some sanding see
if I can clean up this wood
[Music]
[Music]
few things we're going to be doing on
the router first one we're going to give
a little decorative U Edge to this piece
this will be going down this way
pressing on the
flowers sorry this way so let's get this
[Music]
rotted well even though sigh is better
at and probably enjoy sanding more than
I do I figured these burn marks are my
fault from the router so I better sand
these
[Music]
down note to self next time try to get
side to do the
same okay on this piece what I need is a
3/4 in
by about an eighth of an inch deep so
3/4 in wide e/ of an inch deep and I
only need it in the center part of this
block so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to start here drop it down on the
bit bring it through stop the router
pull it
[Music]
off there's our groove
okay something I don't normally do I'm
going to go ahead and take a chisel
square off these
ends wish me
[Music]
luck oh I did it okay little tear out
good thing this part is going to be
hidden okay now what I'm going to do is
um drill the holes that the bolts going
to go through it's going to push
everything
[Music]
down okay time for an update
what we've got so far this is going to
be our uh well we'll start with this
piece this is going to be our base it's
mahogany with the U poppler running
around it the gaps here are so that we
can mount the cross piece in
there have the cross piece
made and
our uh threaded Rod will be coming up
through here and we're going to cap this
off so we'll put the bolt in there we'll
epoxy it in
place okay this is going to be the
bottom that's going to actually push
down here what we're going to do is put
a piece of um metal in here will epoxy
in place so when the bolt pushes down it
won't be trying to dig into the wood the
bolt will also be able to spin around
but it will be epoxied to the rod itself
and so this will be a cap this will be
the part that pushes
down
so it would look about like that with
our cross
piece place and the bolt driving through
well here's our last step what we're
going to do is put some epoxy in
here put it on the rod and let it set up
and we're ready to ship onto to
sign so let's get this done well that
finishes up part one of the flower press
