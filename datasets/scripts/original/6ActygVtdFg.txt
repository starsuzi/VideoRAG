B it down welcome to Bake It download
and welcome to my kitchen now with
Father's Day coming up this Sunday I
thought I'd break my dad a bit of a
treat so I'm going for the fairy
cakes first of all we're going to need
some ingredients self-raising
flour glass of
sugar even look at it
[Music]
eggs butter vanilla
extract
milk oh that could have been bad icing
sugar and hundreds and thousands to
[Music]
decorate let's try that again shall
we much
better let's
bake right so before you start you want
to preheat your oven to 180Â° Cen great o
gas Mark 4 and just remember if you are
one of our younger viewers get help from
an adult while doing this we're going to
take our butter put that in the
bowl and a little tip here try keep your
butter at room temperature cuz that
makes it a lot easier to mix then we're
going to add our
sugar and with our whisk we're going to
give it a
mix make sure that your butter and sugar
is all properly mixed before we continue
this step two
[Music]
now we're going to crack our eggs and
add them to the
mixture I like to add a teaspoon of
vanilla extract just to make sure it's
really nice and
tasty and now we're going to give it a
mix with our whisk
again M yum it's not ready to eat yet
but it does smell
nice
[Music]
now we're going to add 110 G of flour
about 2 tbspoon of milk take a large
spoon like this one and fold it all in
so we're going to keep doing this till
you get it to a nice soft dropping
consistency now it's time to put our
cake mix into the cases and I like to do
this by using an ice cream scoop one of
these little things all you do spoon it
up like that put it over the case flip
it around squeeze the trigger thing
there now you might even want to get
help from an adult if you're a younger
viewer because we are going to be using
the
oven so they're going in for 10 to 12
minutes but what can we do in that time
I tell you what it is Father's day so we
better not leave a mess let's get
cleaning
[Music]
perfect
[Music]
timing this is the fun part now we've
got our fairy cakes baked we're going to
use some icing and decorate them so you
can put anything you want on them as
long as it's edible of course go ahead
and pipe it around like this
so there you have it these are my
fantastic fairy cakes all
decorated oh I'm a fairy oh look
conveniently there's some fairy cakes
waiting for
me oh well that's bake it download
[Music]
