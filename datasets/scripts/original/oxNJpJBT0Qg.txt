Today on Hobby Wild we are taking a look at
how to germinate chilli seeds using the Paper
Towel Method.
You will need a pen, chilli seeds, a zip lock
bag and 2 sheets of paper towel.
Spray the towel with water so that it is damp,
but not soaking wet.
Lay out your seeds.
Remember that not all of them will germinate,
so put out maybe twice as many as you think
you will need.
Give them another quick spray of water.
Lay a second paper towel on top and give it
another light spray of water.
Fold the paper towel so that it will fit into
your zip lock bag.
Seal the bag carefully and label.
Place the bag in a warm location for a few
days, such as on a radiator.
Mine has been in my mini electric green house
for around 5 days.
Some seeds will take weeks.
I had the zip lock bag sitting on some container
lids, so that they don't overheat on the bottom
heated floor of the green house.
Unfold the paper towel carefully.
You should notice straight away that many
have grown tails, if you don't see any then
moisten the paper towel if needed and place
them back in a warm location for a few more
days before checking again.
These seeds can then be planted with the tail
facing downwards.
Cover them very lightly with soil and give
them a drink of water.
Alternatively you may wish to plant many seeds
in a larger planter to save space, then just
keep the strongest plants.
Cover these with soil before giving them a
drink of water.
I hope that you have enjoyed this Hobby Wild
