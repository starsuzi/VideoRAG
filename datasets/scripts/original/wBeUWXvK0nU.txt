well one of the first things we're going
to do is we're going to apply some water
just to make sure that there's not a
cure and seal on here looks like it's
sort of soaking in does that tell us we
don't have a sealer correct
i'm spraying water on the floor right
now just to make sure everything's
getting absorbed
i can see right away that the water is
pulling away in this area here
and we need to spot degrease this and if
you could put some degreaser on here
i'll continue spraying the floor
looking for some more problem areas
any uh concerns just washing this
degreaser off into the driveway no this
is a biodegradable product it's
environmentally friendly and we should
have no problems
now that we've degreased surf floor our
next step is we're going to acid etching
acid so i guess that explains the rubber
boots gloves and goggles you've
outfitted us with correct this is the
acid yes it is in this particular case
we add
one of these to two gallons of water
we are going to use a plastic sprinkling
can
that's important because we don't want
to use metal acid reacts with metal
and we want to make sure our floor is
damp so that the acid has a chance to
flow out the acid is reacting with the
surface of the concrete and it's
allowing us to have some good mechanical
adhesion
now that we've finished acid etching
we're just going to rinse whatever dirt
or loose particles were created and get
the floor clean again so no concerns
about rinsing the acid out into the
driveway no that acid has all reacted
with the concrete and has become a salt
when the acid reacts with the concrete
it leaves little tiny particles of grip
behind so we're going to use this wet
vac to remove those off the surface
how's that floor feel brian feels real
good and dry so just how dry do we need
it before we put the epoxy down well the
floor should be completely dry next step
is we mix our epoxy together an epoxy
comes in two parts a part a and a part b
you need to mix the two of them together
for that chemical reaction occur mix it
well
wait 30 minutes and we're ready for
application so 30 minutes to set up and
now we can paint and how long do we have
to work with it the epoxy has two to two
and a half hours of pot life that's why
we don't want to mix up any more than we
need to ahead of time
whenever painting a floor
it's a good idea to work in
approximately a two feet deep by six
foot wide area
and then use your finishing strokes in a
perpendicular direction
so brian what do you think i think it
looks great you know one coat does look
good but if we put two down it's gonna
look fabulous
i think we should let this dry come back
tomorrow and put down a second
so doug did we have a good night for
drying yes we did kevin all right well
let's see how it looks hey good morning
brian morning
can i walk on it absolutely all right
brian what do you think i think it's
definitely an improvement for what we
had
it does look good but i can see a few
places where it's a little bit thin and
not quite as uniform as it could be so
second coat yeah a second coat will take
care of these problems and there's
something else we can do to dress this
floor up even more
as a decorative effect we have these
color flakes that we can add to the
finished floor system they help hide
some of these imperfections in the floor
plus they give us a very nice look floor
needs a second coat but not the walls
brian we've got enough painted here now
that it's time to start putting the
color flakes down it's important to put
the color flakes down into the epoxy
while it's still wet so we have good
adhesion
how does that look brian
i think that looks really good that
looks like a good job
