different for
stuffing these are going to be a little
bit like soapas remember those or soapes
rather not soapas but
soapes soap Pia that means a little
pillow is what they tell me but actually
if you break it down I mean soai is soup
so it's really for uh using it in
soup okay so there's one see how thick
it is
you let the the dough sit for a
while and uh it bubbles up real
nice okay here goes
the there's no hole in
it these are going to be the stuff soap
up here
so I'm making them a little bit
thicker the milk is going to keep them
soft because there's no shortening in
it

corn um
masarina they're going to look quite a
bit like this
okay these are ready

towel these are
heavier but you're going to be cutting
these in half or making a big
pocket I'll show

serrated
edge when these are cool enough to
handle just cut them like
this and uh we're going to put
