hey guys it's Jessica with quills and
Tails and today I'm going to be
introducing you to my hedgehog truffles
so truffles is about 3 and 1/2 years old
and he is an African pygmy
hedgehog and this is his cage he lives
in a 3x2 cube Cuban coroplast
cage and it's actually um two units high
so it has the unit here where he lives
on and then also a storage unit at the
bottom so I'm just going to be showing
you him um I'm not really going to go
into like a cage tour just because I can
do another video on that if you guys
want but I'm just going to be showing
you my hedgehog so he is in
here and I just cleaned his cage so it
should be pretty clean here let me Focus
this real quick okay so truffles is
currently inside his little Hut so I'm
going to open this
up and show them to you now uh right now
it's probably it probably feels like
midnight for him so he's going to be a
little bit grumpy but as usual uh my
hedgehog he's always been a little bit
grumpy he's not always been the
friendliest so I'm just going to show
you
him so here he is I'm going to roll him
on his
back there you go okay so here's
truffles like I said he's a little bit
grumpy but um go
on and for those of you who um don't
know he only has one eye as you can see
if I can get him to come on if I can get
him to show you um he has this eye right
here but then his eye on the other side
is actually not here because whenever he
was a baby we believe that he poked
himself in the eye with one of his
quills and basically it just got
infected and um it pretty much just died
his eye just kind of died and as
horrible as that sounds he's been
completely fine like um I think he gets
a little bit more scared when I pick him
up from this side um really want
to he you guys here let me do
this can't even see what I'm doing hold
on here we go um he actually he gets a
little bit more scared when I pick him
up from um the other side just because
you can't really see my hand coming but
if I pick him up from like the right
side then you can he can kind of
see so let me put this on how Focus
so there he is as you can see he has um
that eye on that side and no eye on that
side it's not really anything major it
doesn't look gross or anything it's just
not there um so he kind of like Squints
on that eye he just kind of closes that
eye so but I mean obviously you can see
it doesn't um make him go crazy or
anything he's completely fine
so yeah um that's pretty much my
hedgehog truffles um obviously he's a
guy so and and yeah I believe he is a um
Algerian chocolate color um not 100%
sure on that but that's just what I
think when I got him whenever he was
younger I originally thought he was a
salt and pepper but as he's gotten older
he's developed more into a h chocolate
color so or like a brown or gray so
that's kind of what I think he is so
yeah that's my hedgehog hope you guys
