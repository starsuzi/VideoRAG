Hello everybody welcome back to the cool
kitchen we're baking bread again um it's
a different bread this time it's called
fuka I'm sure most of you know it it's
an Italian bread which you get in
restaurants quite often uh or I'm sure
some of you might have tried it before
um it's typically um you know really
nice and oily uh and taste of Rosemary
uh my bread is slightly different my
recipe of fuka it's thicker and more
moist and it's more moish really it's
really really nice bread um it's always
a great favorite at parties uh it's a
great party food really if you want to
feed a lot of people make fatcha it's
really really easy as well so I hope you
give it a go uh and yeah I hope you
enjoy this video so what ingredients do
you need uh it's again very simple it's
bread so it's not rocket science um so
we need some white flour some bread
flour um we'll use 800 G of strong white
bread flour uh we'll also be using 200 g
of simina uh which is similar I guess to
planta in a way it's a maze type flour
it's really great and it gives the bread
an amazing
texture uh and then we'll also need salt
of course uh 1
tbspoon um enough olive oil you just see
during the video how much you need you
need to coat the dough into in the olive
oil but you also need to put it into the
into the dough uh you'll also need yeast
of course I'm using dried yeast as usual
uh you need enough yeast for 1 kg um of
flour uh so two sachet will be enough
and I also just picked some Rosemary
which we'll put into the dough and over
as well so first we mix the dry
ingredients I've got yeast salt simola
and flour in here uh so just make it
with a
fork and if you have any questions or if
you wonder about just basic bread making
um you can watch my other bread making
video which is quite good just to see
how basic bread is done and it explains
all the steps uh in more
detail normally with Pacha you just
sprinkle a bit of Rosemary on top which
is nice but I really like the flavor of
Rosemary and I find the best way to get
it in into the dough is really what just
to mix it with oil um you could just
chop it finely um but I have a pestil
and mor here so I will just crush it and
mix it with the oil and then mix it into
the
dough then you just add a bit of
oil that should be about enough so a few
tablespoons I know two or three
tablespoons a bit more never
hurts this measures really just by ey
but it just takes a bit of experience
just try it
out and you will see what's the what's
the best option for
you there you go that's done okay so now
we're combining the dry ingredients and
and the wet ingredients uh so there's
about 650 mil of lukewarm water it's
really important that the water is not
too warm or else it will kill the yeast
so it can't be like boiling or really
hot uh and here's our rosemary oil so we
just pour it in and mix it with a fork
that's what I always like to
do now we add the oil oops getting messy
already
go try to get all that goodness out of
it that's why I'm using the
spatula try to get some of that oil
everywhere mix it a bit
more and after one or two minutes you
can just start using your hands
so now starting to work the dough by
hand just putting some flour on my hands
and normally I start this process just
using using one hand so the other one
doesn't get too
dirty cuz now the dough is still pretty
sticky just try to get most of that
flour still on the dough mix
it you also want this dough to be a bit
wetter than your usual or typical bread
recipe
uh cuz that will really influence the
flavor if it's a bit wetter and that oil
as well in the dough will just make it
really nice and
moist that looks as good as it can
get just take it out on the work
surface and just start working the
dough you don't have to work this Dough
too much cuz it's mostly uh White flour
so there's a lot of gluten and it and it
will rise very well and it's quite
stretchy
anyway so just really 5 minutes or so it
should do the job just to get it
together there's no real well huge
secret I find to kneading bread just try
to get a
rhythm uh if the dough gets too wet for
your fingers maybe put some more flour
on
it just try to work it any way that you
find is
comfortable I've been needing the dough
for 5 minutes now which is really enough
for this kind of bread so now I'm just
going to tuck it into a tight ball and
put it into the bowl to let It Rise um
again just look at my other bread video
if you want to um know about just basic
techniques for bread making so just tuck
it in turn it
around and just try to get those EDG is
inside so that it's a nice
Bowl I'll just put it in here
again sprinkle it with some
flour and put a tea towel over
it and let it just sit in there for
about an hour you want to give this a
nice long fermentation so that the dough
comes really light and stretchy and
that's
it after an hour our dough has doubled
in size you can see um and one reason
why I also like making fuka the rest of
well of the recipe is really simple
there's no extra kneading or shaping of
the dough it's really really easy so you
just need uh one of these baking
trays just put in some olive
oil just for the
bottom just put it around
this and then you just put the
dough
inside try to put it in
gently there we
[Music]
go and then you just deflate it into the
baking
tray you deflate just by poking your
fingers into the dough so the gas that
was created during you know the rising
of the dough comes
out try to get it as regular as possible
but it doesn't have to be
perfect that's great because it has to
rise for a second
time and that will take about 20
minutes or maybe half an hour so we'll
check back after 20
minutes so after 20 minutes the dough
has risen not completely like doubled in
size but it has risen and uh We've
preheated our oven to well Max
temperature of most ovens so 250°
C and now I'm just going to sprinkle
some of the Rosemary on top just try to
break it up in pieces a bit um again it
doesn't have to look or be perfect but
just like nice and then I'm also going
to add some salt after that uh you
should really use rock salt but because
it tastes great and looks cool too um
but I don't have any at the moment so
I'm just using regular sea
salt but yeah normally just use rock
salt there you go that's about
right more here yeah just some salt over
it not too much though cuz there's
already salt in the
dough just a light
sprinkling okay and uh traditionally
fuka has these holes so with just one
finger I'm going to go into the dough
and press it in as
such so that it's going to get a cool
look and then it's going to the oven so
at 250° CES um for about 20 minutes or
so
just check on it after a while and see
if it's ready um and poke it with one of
but either a toothpick or whatever you
have or a knife and see if it's baked if
it's cooked through and it's done it's
been a bit more than 20 minutes now and
uh the bread is done the fukae is done
so if you look
in it's nice gold and brown on top and
if you stick in toothpick or cure for
that you can see it comes out clean so
it's done so I took out the fuka and put
it on a cooling rack for about half an
hour so it cool could cool down properly
and it's still nice and warm and it has
a lovely color really uh and you can see
the small dents we put in with our
fingers which is a traditional fuka uh
shape and look so uh yeah it's a really
easy bread to make basically and it's
amazing you know for parties or for
larger groups of people so tasty and
especially that smolina and white flour
mix but also the Rosemary and the olive
oil in the dough really make this quite
a different fuka recipe so I hope you
had to try it and I hope you enjoyed
this video now how do you normally eat
fuka well you could basically eat it
with anything like a normal bread but
it's really great for dipping into olive
oil and that's how it's served quite
often so I got some nice olive oil here
and you see it just really absorbs soil
really
well that olive oil
flavor and the Rosemary is fantastic but
I also love
it with some hummus and by coincidence I
have some amazing lemon and D hummus
here
m m
hummus and fukasha
amazing you have to try this
