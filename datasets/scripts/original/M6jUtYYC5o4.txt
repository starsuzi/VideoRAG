hello again my name's John and welcome
to another video this time we'll show
you how we make our traditional
Yorkshire puddings I try to work out how
many we've made over the years at work
and I've lost count around 400,000 so we
do have a little experience in
mayonnaise but they are very simple to
make and
here's a list of the ingredients you've
made if you want to have a go at making
them yourself
okay I start by preheating the oven to
200 degrees Celsius plus 395 Fahrenheit
or gas mark 6 I'm said in mind to 100
nearly Celsius because my oven is fun
assisted and it runs about 20 degrees
hotter than indicated on the dial
and for this recipe you need a 12-cup
muffin tin
the 12th cup tins are the ones who use
it work this 4 cup is a more domestic
tin but this recipe is exactly the same
whatever size 10 you have no Yorkshire
pudding is always best untraditionally
cooped in beef dripping if you can't get
that you can use lard or even vegetable
oil I'm using beef drippin so I'll put
approximately 8 grams that's quarter of
an ounce in each cup
ok I'll place the tray in the preheated
oven and then get started on the butter
[Music]
right start by adding the eggs and the
salt to the ball and give those a good
whisk before adding the flour you can
use a stand or hand mixer to do this
recipe but not everyone has balls so
I'll demonstrate by hand
[Music]
trying to work the flour whisk the flour
into the eggs until it becomes a thick
paste then add a little of the milk and
water to loosen it up a bit and whisk
this until there's no lumps left before
adding the rest of the milk and water if
you want all the liquid at once you'll
have a terrible job trying to get all
the lumps out so believe me it's easier
this way
[Music]
once the butter is smooth you can add
the rest of the milk and water and whisk
that in
[Music]
right almost done just give the butter a
final whisk for about a minute if you're
using a machine made up 30 seconds
by the way this butter will happily sit
in your fridge for a dear - if he wanted
to make it beforehand after a few hours
in the fridge it'll go a dirty gray
color but it's fine just give it away
scoop to revive it when you're ready to
use it
now transfer the butter into a jug ready
for filling the muffin cups
[Music]
don't waste any scrape all of the butter
out of the ball with a spatula
okay time to start cooking them very
carefully take the hot tin out of the
oven because this is extremely hot
and fill the tins on top of a cooker
whatever you do don't put these tins on
a wooden work top
right fill the cups half where
[Music]
if there's any left chopped them up
again until the jokes MD
then get them straight into the oven and
set your timer for 30 minutes I'll do a
short demonstration on the fork Upton in
a moment now don't be tempted to sneak a
look off we're through or you'll risk
them collapse him with the sudden drop
in temperature when the oven door opens
[Music]
okay after 30 minutes take out these
beautiful golden-brown Yorkshire
puddings you can serve these
straightaway or they'll keep in the
refrigerator for two to three days or
you could make a large batch of them
because these freeze very well
[Music]
okay as promised I'll quickly speed
through the 14 version but like I said
earlier it's exactly the same recipe as
for the 1210 but this size will only
give you about ear Yorkshire puddings or
what they are bit bigger
[Music]
in my next video I'll be doing a
variation on this theme by making a
classic British recipe in fact I'll be
demonstrating the whole mail which has
been a favorite with our customers for
many years
these Yorkshire puddings are
traditionally served with roast beef but
they go with any roast meat also they
grip with stews and casseroles
