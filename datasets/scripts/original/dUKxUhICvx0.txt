Even on a material as high-end as BamDeck,
you may come across a stain that is particularly
stubborn.
First, try other cleaning methods and then
wait a couple months because sun exposure
usually helps stains disappear.
If after this time the stain is still there,
you may try sanding or pressure washing.
Remember that these should be last resort
options.
If done too harshly, sanding can affect your
bamboo deckâ€™s original texture and is generally
not a great idea.
However, for very stubborn stains you may
try lightly sanding the area with paper that
has a very fine grit.
Same thing with pressure washing.
In general, we do not recommend it because
if done incorrectly it can cause damage to
composite decks.
However, skilled professionals using washers
with low pressures (under 15-hundred PSI)
and wide fan tip nozzles spraying at least
12 inches above the deck surface may do the
trick.
Again, these are last resort cleaning options
and should only be attempted if regular clean-up
solutions have not worked.
