okay guys today on henry's tattoos
with anzac day coming up i'm going to
show you how to make your own anzac
cookies
very simple and very delicious let's get
straight into it
first thing we're going to do is preheat
our oven to about 160 degrees
to get yourselves a mixing bowl we're
going to add in one cup of some plain
flour
next we're gonna add one and a quarter
cups of oats
about one cup of brown sugar
about a teaspoon of salt
and about half a teaspoon of 5 cup soda
that's a bit too much though so i'll
just give that a quick mix around
okay now we get started with the next
step okay guys in a small saucepan or a
pan
just add 130 grams of salted butter
to this we're also going to add two
tablespoons of golden syrup
and about two tablespoons of water
just continue stirring that until it's
all melted and combined
if you want to make it faster just put
your body into smaller pieces before you
add it in rather than just one big block
okay guys so we're almost there so at
this stage you can go ahead and turn
your head off
and we'll go ahead and add this mixture
to our dryer mixture
and we just want to fold that in make it
nice and combined
now guys what a lot of people do is they
add about a quarter cup of
desiccated coconut as well i prefer
not to i just don't like coconut
but if you like it go ahead and add it
in now
okay guys so grab yourselves a large
baking shredder like this one
we're just going to put some greaseproof
paper there
and we want to put about tablespoons of
cooking mixture on
now you can use gloves if you prefer
because it is quite sticky
okay guys so go ahead and put that
straight into the oven now
so we'll just leave this in there for
about 10 to 15 minutes or until golden
brown
so just check it after 10 minutes okay
so it's been 15 minutes so let's have a
quick look
as you can see they're golden so we'll
go ahead and turn our oven off
now let them sit in there for about 10
minutes and then we'll bring them back
out
okay so it's been 10 minutes so let's go
ahead and bring them out
look at that perfect golden brown
it's still soft self-deserved and that's
what we want
so guys as you can see these are as
perfect as you can get them
100 times better than the store-bought
one hope you enjoyed them guys
