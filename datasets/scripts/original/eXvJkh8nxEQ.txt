hi guys today I'll be making an inside
out disgust glitter
globe that is the most disgusting thing
that I have ever seen we all know that
disgust really does not like eating
broccoli whatever I'm calling it the
broccoli dinner glitter Globe yes and
I'll be in it uh no I'll be in it uh no
she's going to choose me you are way too
small for this glitter globe I've got a
few things here I've got some pretend
spoons and
forks and I've got some really tiny
pretend
broccoli some green glitter
glue and some air drying modeling
clay I'll firstly paint the modeling
paste onto the base of the GL
globe and then I'll press press the
sponge in to give it a texture that
resembles
broccoli decided I want to make a
lighter green on the top part and leave
the side to look like
broccoli and I'll just push a little
pattern onto the
top
next I'll just take a little piece of
air dry clay and fill up the
toy and then I'll take a second piece
and make her like a
cushion I will lightly hit the sides of
the cushion to give it some
shape so now we'll push discus into the
clay so it's like she's sitting down
into the cushion and making her own
crease into the
cushion next I'll just tidy up the extra
bits with my little plastic toy
Fork the next step is to prepare the
table with a plate of broccoli I'll fill
up the little cup with some
clay and using my hot glue I'll stick
the plate to the bottom of the
cup so the cup is upside down
alternatively just use some hobby glue
and hold it on longer you do need an
adult to use the hot
glue now I'm going to stick all the
broccoli onto the
plate and I think I'll give her some
broccoli to drink as
well almost like a br broccoli
juice now it's time to stick a few more
cups to each other to make the stand for
the
table I'm painting the sides that look
like broccoli with green glitter
glue and the push and disgust is sitting
on I'll paint
pink I'll glue everything into position
now and add a little pink
fork to the
plate I've cut two inserts into a little
piece of Bolsa wood this can be bought
in an art shop as well and on on either
side I'll insert the miniature Spoon and
Fork now everything is stuck down next I
took a photo of
disgust printed it out and now I've cut
it out to stick onto the base of the
glitter
globe and I'm ready to mix the glitter
with the water first I'll put some green
glitter and I'll add some lovely stars
as
well the glitter looks really
lovely time to fill it up you can also
add some food Glycerine into it to help
float the glitter
better the toy boys do stay nice and dry
inside whatever well I have to say this
broccoli dinner looks disgustingly
disgusting that is the most disgusting
thing that I have ever seen I'm going to
be sick well guys I hope you enjoyed the
