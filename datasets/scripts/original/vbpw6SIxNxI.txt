hi i'm rachel yatuzis and i'm going to
show you how to clean a steam iron
a lot of times what happens is your seam
iron will get clogged and people really
don't know
what to do to clean it out
some irons have specific instructions to
use special iron cleaner
i really think that's a good marketing
technique but all you need is vinegar
vinegar will clean and unclog almost
anything even drains vinegar and baking
soda is great for that so why not use it
for your iron right
what you want to do is
fill the reservoir of your iron a fourth
of the way full with vinegar
i've already added quite a bit to this
one so i'm just going to add a little
bit more but you want to fill it a
quarter of the way up with the vinegar
you want to have a nice clean white
cloth and this is what you're going to
use to dispense all of the vinegar out
of here
you want to spray and iron and spray
and iron and keep doing this
until
the water reservoir is empty
next
when it is empty
get distilled water this will keep it
from clogging again it'll help rinse it
out really well rinse all the vinegar
out
so pour some distilled water into the
reservoir fill it all the way with the
distilled water
and do the same thing spray
an iron and spray an iron
and you can even if you have like a
cookie rack or this is a broiler pan
set it on top and just hold the steam
button down you know just keep spraying
it
keep doing this until it's
empty
and once you're done with that just fill
it up with water and it's ready to go
i'm rachel yatus and that is how you
clean a steam iron
