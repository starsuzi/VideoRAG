hello and welcome to tingle my taste
buds and in today's video I'll be
showing you how to cook smoked haddock
so let's get to it
here
put some olive oil and maybe some herbs
on the fish and leave it to rest for
about five minutes to soak up the
flavors add salt if you wish heat your
pan with a few tablespoons of olive oil
in it I when hot
put it on the fillet skin side down cook
on that side on high for about four
minutes and then flip over and cook for
about two minutes
the drizzle with some lemon
juice if you wish and serve immediately
with a nice side
