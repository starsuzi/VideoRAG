hi I'm Dan hul the building official for
the City of Blaine uh many projects
including fences require that you
establish your property lines before you
get a permit uh this is very important
uh because we need to measure off that
line for setbacks and so forth so
property pin looks like this they're in
each one Each corner of your lot to find
your corner
markers I recommend starting from the
from the front yard at the street
typical Corner markers are 14 1/2 ft
back from the curb your property line
starts 14 1/2 ft back from the curb in
most instances and your survey will
indicate this so you take a measuring
device we'll start right at the curb
here and it gets up an
approximation it'll go back 14 and 1/2
ft that brings us right out to about
here before you start digging you want
to call go for State
one numbers 811 they'll come out and
Mark your any underground wiring and so
forth it's a very important step before
you do any
digging
simply some shallow digging is all
typically you need to do uh these these
markers are anywhere from 6 to 10 in
under the
ground in this case the marker is right
here and it's just underneath the sad
once you establish once you find the one
marker it becomes relatively easy to do
the rest of them if they're if they are
existing place a St next to
this and now measure from here using
your survey back to the next the next
marker the survey will show exactly how
many feet and inches that will
be in some cases you can't you know
they're it's really hard to do this um
to find your first marker and I'd
recommend using a metal detector at that
point you can rent
them and and if that fails uh the worst
case scenario is you have to hire a
license surveyor to come out and
reestablish your property
lines typically you can find them
yourself
