welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays a 
confection in Tallahassee Florida for pouring our  
hot sugar today and it's already flavored with 
strawberries and cream flavoring today we're  
going to do something a little unusual we're 
going to make spiral lollipops but instead of  
making them in the traditional round shape 
we're going to make them in a hearty shape
we have the color and then we 
stir carefully to boil all the  
water out we don't want any water left 
because this will make the candy stick
while it may look like we're adding more sugar 
here or not we're adding citric acid most fruits  
have an acidic content to them and our flavoring 
doesn't so we need to add it back in the citric  
acid may only be added after a certain point 
where the candy will be too hot and the acid  
will burn leaving a lousy taste in the tasters 
mouth the candy that was against the table and  
the bars is now cooled down a lot but the 
bits of the center is still scalding hot  
wave to mix the candy together to make it get 
to an even temperature so we can work with it
as the candy changes states it goes from 
liquid to semi solid to more solid and  
eventually it gets solid enough that we 
can put it over a hook and fold it again  
and again until it becomes white the 
sugar starts as a deep amber but as we  
fold it over and over we trap millions of 
air bubbles and it makes the candy become  
a brilliant white each one of those little air 
bubbles acting is a mirror to reflect the light
it's time to assemble the candy and 
we're going to move the candy to a  
temperature controlled surface that will 
slow down the cooling of the candy to give  
us time to do our assembly we're making 
red and white stripes the white stripes  
are there to reflect the light through the 
red stripes to make it look more jewel like
if you want to order our candy you can try it for 
yourself and get it at our website WWE Network
now that we have a big log of candy we need 
to get it down to the size of a rope so we  
can spiral our lollipops we do this by 
pinching off one end pulling out a log  
slowly and then pulling out rod by rod until 
they all are right to turn into lollipops
we twist the rope making the pattern go 
around it and then we take the rope and  
we make it into a spiral the heart-shaped 
lollypop starts as a traditional circular  
lollipop then the lollipop gets 
passed on to the second candy maker
the second candy maker takes the 
candy and puts it into a steel  
form which they press it into the 
shape of the heart they then take  
a wooden stick and insert it into 
the candy making it into a lollipop
