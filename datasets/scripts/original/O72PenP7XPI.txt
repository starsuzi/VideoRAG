hi friends this is carmen welcome back
to my channel today i'm going to share
with you my collection of san severias
or mother-in-law's tongue or snake plant
i've got seven in total and it seems to
be growing so i've got a lot to share if
you enjoy this video i do so appreciate
a thumbs up and subscribe so you can
stay up to date with all my videos
to start we're going to head outside and
show you a couple of snake plants that i
have out on my balcony the first one i'm
going to show you here is a sense of
area laurentii trifasciata laurentii and
it's actually two of them in here
the longer one was the original one in
this container and then i added the
bird's nest version of the laurentii to
kind of fill in the container
but i wanted to show you that this plant
is so versatile as a houseplant and you
can have it outside and inside now i
live in arizona and right now we're
having over 100 degree weather in the
summer
but this plant is able to handle that
heat it is in the shade they do not do
well in direct sun so you do want to
keep it in the shade if you do have it
outside but i water it about once a week
during the hot summer months and
i do bring it in if by chance it does
get below 40 degrees which is kind of
rare here but this is the second one
that i want to show you the sense of
error trifaciata jade dwarf it's in a
bird's nest form and it's all green
and this one i originally had inside but
it the inner leaves in the center were
getting a little bit lighter green so i
put it outside to get even brighter
light and those leaves turned a darker
green
so although that these plants can take
low light inside
sometimes the color of leaves can change
if you have them in a lower light
situation but if that does happen you
can always bring them outside in the
shade and they'll
pop right up
[Music]
coming back inside i wanted to show you
this beauty here this is a san severia
cylindrica and i got this particular one
at ikea which ikea has some really
fabulous plants by the way but this one
here has such amazing architecture to it
and i think that's one of the things
that i love about sansa berry is they
can go into a modern home or a more
traditional home
but the leaves are what really attract
me to them i do have it in a free
draining soil fast draining soil which
is a cactus soil added with some perlite
and inside i water them about every two
weeks because i it is inside the air
conditioning is on and it takes a little
bit longer for the soil to completely
dry out and for it to need
a good drenching of water so that's
about every two weeks for this one
[Music]
now this little guy is a sansevieria
honey eye in bird's nest form and he's
so cute
he actually has a couple little babies
growing underneath there
for being such a small plant
and the way that they send their babies
up are through rhizomes although the
sansa various do have roots but they
send up their babies their pups through
uh rhizomes that grow so they're eat
very easy to split off very easy to
propagate i'm going to wait a little bit
longer for these to get bigger before i
take them out and and
give them a pot of their own this one's
doing really well in this terra cotta
little cherry potter that i got at a
thrift store
[Music]
okay now i'm going to show some the
newest additions to my collection this
one here is the sansevieria fernwood
mikado and i got it from hertz gardens
online
and it came in a six inch pot i have
already transplanted it into another six
inch pot uh terra cotta pot and the one
thing about scents berries is they do
like to be a little bit pop down they
like to be snug in their pots they do
well that way so you don't want to over
pot it
but this one here looks almost like it
has cylindrical leaves to it but when
you look a little bit closer it has a
little bit concave
form to it so it just makes for a really
unique structure to this plant
[Music]
okay i saved the best for last this is
the one that i have been looking for the
san severia starfish isn't she a beauty
i
was inspired by it when i saw it at a
cactus and succulent show
and i just been searching for it i got
this one in a six inch pot from hertz
gardens as you can see here but it was
very pot bound when i took it out the i
realized that pot was already shaped in
an oval because it had been pushing out
so much so i transplanted it in
to an eight inch pot
gave it that
free draining soil
and this particular pot i got a walmart
now it does have some growth on the side
that if i wanted to i could have
separated those rhizomes and put those
smaller versions of it into it their own
pot but i wanted it to be in its own pot
i think it just looks so spectacular in
its own pot you can see it here
in the um on the counter in my kitchen i
just think it looks wonderful
[Music]
so after seeing these friends i hope it
convinces you that this can be such a
wonderful house plant whether you have
it inside or outside you just don't want
to over water them make sure that they
have some good draining soil
and let it dry out completely before you
water them and they'll do great for you
i hope you enjoyed this video friends if

thanks so much for watching today have a
blessed day
