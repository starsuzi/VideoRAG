to keep fruit from browning once it's
been sliced many people put it in lemon
juice but we found that honey water
works equally well and can actually keep
fruit brighter for longer to test this
tip we diluted two tablespoons of honey
in one cup of water sliced an apple and
let it soak for a few minutes
while our untreated apple slices started
to brown after a few seconds the apples
we had soaked in honey water stayed
bright for over 24 hours
why because browning is caused by an
enzyme called polyphenol oxidase and a
peptide compound in honey stops it from
activating the browning in the fruit the
best news though is that we found apples
needed only a 30 second dunk in the
honey water to stop them from browning
for a solid eight hours
this tip works on fruits like pears and
apples but it's also great for
vegetables like potatoes and parsnips so
mix up a batch of honey water dip your
fruit in and keep it fresh and bright
with a sweet idea
