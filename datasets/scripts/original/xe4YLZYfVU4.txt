HERE WITH HOLIDAY TURKEY TIPS,
PLEASE WELCOME CHEF
DANIEL BOULUD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> HOW ARE YOU?
>> Stephen: OKAY.
CLEAR SOMETHING UP FOR ME-- YOU
ARE A CHEF.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
CHEF AND A COOK?
DOES A CHEF HAVE A NICER HAT OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
>> THE CHEF IS THE BIG BOSS.

BIG BOSS.
>> THE CHEF IS THE ONE WHO
GOVERNS EVERYBODY.

WHAT ARE SOME TIPS FOR MAKING AN

THANKSGIVING?

TURKEY DAY?
>> WE HAVE A TURKEY DAY,
CHRISTMAS, CHRISTMAS IS TURKEY
DAY.
>> Stephen: WE HAVE THAT, TOO.
>> Stephen: LUCKY.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT A CONTEST
BUT WE HAVE TWO OF THEM.
>> I LIKE TO BRIAN MY TURKEY.
>> Stephen: WE BRIAN.
>> IT'S ALMOST LIKE A LIGHT SEA
WATER, SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN
DREAM OF SWIMMING AND SORT OF
TASTING THE SEA WATER.
THAT'S KIND OF THAT BRIAN YOU
WANT.
>> Stephen: SO JUST TAKE THE
TURKEY TO THE BEACH WITH YOU,
WEAR ONE ON EACH ARM LIKE A
WATER WING AND JUST DIVE IN.
GO FOR A SWIM.
>> GIVE IT A SWIM.
>> Stephen: THAT SOUNDS
SIMPLE.
>> AND, OF COURSE, YOU WANT
FLAVOR OF SPICE, AUTUMN FLAVOR.
THAT'S WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL WITH
THANKSGIVING.
IT'S ABOUT CELEBRATING AUTUMN
AND CELEBRATING THE FAMILY AND
CELEBRATING AMERICA.
>> Stephen: EXCELLENT,
EXCELLENT.
>> BUT CELEBRATING AMERICA, I
WANTED TO DO A TADUNCAN.
ROASTING A TURKEY LIKE THIS,
ANYBODY CAN DO THAT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S CHILD'S
PLAY.
YOU'RE DANIEL BOULUD, YOU'RE
GOING TO DO A TURKDUNCAN IN
FRENCH?
>> I THINK THE WORD IS FRENCH.
>> Stephen: IT'S NOT FRENCH.
I THINK IT'S A MENAGE-A-DUNCAN.
>> TURKEY, DUCK, AND CHICKEN
MAKEATUREDUCKAN.
I HAVE FIVE BIRDS IN
MYATUREDUNCAN.
AND I USE LIVER AND TRUFFLE
INSIDE.
SO START BY BONING ALL THE
BIRDS.
ALL THE BIRDS GET BONELESS.
>> Stephen: THIS LOOKS LIKE AN
OUTTAKE FROM "SAW 2."
>> THEY ARE ALL HOLDING HANDS
WITH EACH OTHER.
>> Stephen: I'M SURE THEY'RE
ALL VERY HAPPY AND WE'LL PUT THE
FEATHERS AND HEADS ON AFTER THE
SHOW.
>> I BONEs THE QUILL, AND I
BONELESS THE SQUAB, AND I
BONELESS THE CHICKEN, AND I
DON'TLESS THE TURKEY.
AND THEN WHITE MEAT, DARK MEAT,
WHITE MEAT, DARK MEAT.
>> Stephen: THAT'S VERY
INCLUSIVE OF YOU.
>> AND I SEASON ALL THE MEAT AND
I START TO WRAP THEM UP.
SO QUAIL WRAPPED IN SQUAB, SQUAB
WRAPPED IN CHICKEN, CHICKEN
WRAPPED IN DUCK, AND DUCK
WRAPPED IN TURKEY.
TO GET THERE, FIRST YOU BACK A
BALOTINE OF BIRDS.
>> Stephen: BALOTINE?
>> THAT'S FRENCH.
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO CALL --
>> SURE IT IS.
>> BASICALLY THE BALOTINE ARE
THOSE FOUR BIRDS TOGETHER.
AND WE COOK IN THE OVEN.
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU COOK
THEM?
HOW DO YOU GET THEM INTO THE
SHAPE?
>> NOW WE NEED TO WORK.
DON'T FORGET THE OTHER COOK.
I AM THE CHEF.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Stephen: HOW DO YOU GET
THEM IN THIS SHAPE?
>> I WRAPPED THEM IN ALUMINUM
FOIL AND BUTTER IT AND COOK IT
IN THE OVEN LIKE A PAPIOT.
>> YOU SQUEEZE THE BOTH SIDE AND
PAPIOT IS LIKE CHRISTMAS CANDY
YOU GET IN A PAPER WHERE IT HAS
LITTLE FRU-FRU ON THE SIDE.
>> Stephen: WE CALL THAT A
JOINT IN AMERICA.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
>> SO COME HERE.
LET ME DO THE TURKEY.
YOU GO THERE.
>> Stephen: I HOLD IT?
>> GRAB THE WINGS.
MY TURKEY HAS BEEN BONELESS, AND
I DID A LITTLE BIT OF A --
>> LIKE THIS?
LIKE THIS?
>> IT'S NOT LIKE A FACELIFT, BUT
I DID A GOOD JOB AT SEWING THE
TURKEY.
HOLD ON TIGHT.
TURN AROUND.
TURN, TURN, TURN.
THIS WAY, THIS WAY, THIS WAY.
>> Stephen: THERE YOU GO.
>> WE NEED TO PUT IT IN, PUT IT
IN.
PUT IT IN.

THE TURKEY IS STUFFED.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen: AND THAT'S HOW YOU
DO LA MAZE.
>>, OF COURSE, I LOVE THIS
TURKEY.
BUT I'M NOT TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH
THIS ONE.
I'M IN LOVE WITH MY TURDUNCAN.
>> Stephen: THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.
RIGHT THERE, CHEF.
GORGEOUS.
CAN I TAKE THE GLOVES OFF NOW?
>> YES.
LOOK AT THAT.
IT WAS A 20-POUND TURKEY, AND
NOW IT'S ABOUT 32 POUNDS.
>> Stephen: WOW, YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS ON
THANKSGIVING DAY.
YOU GO IN 20 POUNDS, YOU COME
OUT--
>> BE CAREFUL WITH THE KNIFE.
>> Stephen: THE KNIFE, BE
CAREFUL?
>> I WANT TO YOU GIVE ME THE
HONOR OF SPLITTING THE
TURDUNCAN.
I'M SECURING THE TURKEY RIGHT

THE MIDDLE BUT CUTTING-- KEEP
