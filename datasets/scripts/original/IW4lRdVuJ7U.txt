here goes scotch pancakes one-handed
pour little blob into the frying pan
get a bit closer out you can see those
bubbles forming as it cooks
it only needs less than a minute on this
side
before we turn it over
let's just prod it round the edge with
the spatula
ease the spatula underneath to see
whether we can flip it
excuse me just clear out the picture
one two three remember i'm doing this
with one hand
one two three
you can see how pretty it looks on the
other side
just give it a few more seconds
my hands are getting hot because i'm so
close to the frying pan that i can live
with that
and now i think that's about done
onto the plate there we go
scotch pancakes flat pancakes
