his latest accident was
he completely thrashed open his forehead
um the vet had to come out and give
stitches he had I think the vet said it
was like 12 um Mike had to come out and
help me get him out of him because after
his accident he's completely head shy he
will not let anybody touch his head he
has always had an issue with everything
but food in his mouth so bits or wormers
I have to sit there and fight with him
to get his head down cuz he just knows
he'll just lift it up so I can't him all
right so Ike is a little head shy um
because he bashed his head so hard vet
had to come out put stitches in and
everything else and he figured every
time somebody went to touch him after
that he was going to get hurt so on the
head shy horses what I do is I'll start
petting him here on the neck and I'll
come to his nose a little bit I'll come
to his neck and I'll come to his nose
and you could do this without a halter
or with a halter it doesn't really
matter right here
good and then right
up right
here here we
go so I'm going to stay here with him
for a second good boy let him you know
relax I'm not going to back away from
him if I back away from him or take the
pressure off him then that's going to
mean for him to throw his head or be you
know more head shy good boy I was
wondering if he's going to be head shy
there for a second I said oh man you got
to do something good boy
good then I'm going pet him
here good now when you're working with a
head shy horse be careful you know I'm
always going to have my hand right here
cuz I've had them before throw their
heads into my face and that 40 lb bone
breaking your nose hurts or knocking you
know knocking your teeth out good
boy good good right so I'll pet them on
the neck I'll pet him on the nose then
I'll pet him on the neck then I'll pet
him on the nose and then the neck neck
and then the nose and I'll keep going
like this until he's comfortable then
all of a sudden I'm going to go like
this I'm going to go over his ears just
as fast as I can that's as fast as I can
take my hand over his ears I'm going to
by the time he reacted my hand was
already back here on his neck again good
so you just want to keep doing this now
the next thing You' want to do is you
want to put one hand one hand on his uh
pull one hand on his nose and you're
just going to rest your hands here the
second he drops his
ears the second he drops his ears right
there even a quarter of an inch you know
just watch the tip just watch the tip of
his ear right here the second he drops
it even a quarter of an inch take your
hands off it doesn't matter if he throws
his head up 7 feet in the air as soon as
it comes down a quarter of an inch take
the pressure away whether you keep your
hands up there or
not good
boy good right there oh good boy that
was a nice one good so just tell me he's
a good boy and that's about where I
wanted his head you know with the head
shy horse you know now I you know I'm
above his head now you got an itch I'm
above his head now no if he does that
then I'll just go back to ask him to
lower his head again good good
boy good H I'm still right here good
boy good good right there now I can
start going over his ears again now his
head's about where I want it good boy
and this is the first part in the
haltering and bridling your horses it's
the first part into teaching your horses
how to accept the wormers you know good
boy so this about where we want him at
good boy and then I want to come over
and put my arm over here and I would
never lock my hand down right here my my
elbow down because if I did and he threw
his head up I'd get
hurt so I want to make sure my hand can
always come off his neck you know my my
uh shoulders and to come off his neck if
I lock my hand down here or lock down
right here he could throw me up in the
air so I'd want to be careful so if he
did throw his head up uh my elbow would
come off good boy so we're going to sit
here and play with his head a little bit
more good good
boy good good boy good for
you all right so now when it comes to
haltering
them oh I'm pick up my halter you don't
have to have the lead line on when
you're doing it just gets in the
way good boy
and depending whether horses ever had a
halter on or not um if they never had a
halter on I I'll leave the halter right
here on my arm and then I'll start
asking him to lower his head every time
he lowers his head his nose comes closer
to the halter so if I'm right here again
his nose is going to start becoming a
lot closer to the halter and then what
I'll do is I'll put it right here then
right here then right here then right
here then eventually I'll have it in my
hand and I'll come up to him like this
that's with a horse that's never had a
halter on uh before horses that are just
bad at accepting halters I'll hold it in
my hand like it is right here yeah and
I'll have him start lowering his head
lowering his nose into it good boy just
like that good for you and then again
good and again good
boy good come on oh come back over here
buddy and lower your head and again good
and again
and then what we can do after a
while hey what we can
do and eventually I could hold the
halter like this could put a little bit
of pressure right there like we've been
teaching him how to drop his head and we
start teach him how to drop his nose
into the halter good boy then take it
off and hold it down here kiss to him
put a little bit of pressure up
here good boy right there I'll take that
then you just put it on
all right good
boy oh he does that keep your keep the
pressure on ask him to bring his head
back down good boy we'll do it
again there you go right there and then
he eventually when you kiss to him you
show him the halter he'll just put his
own nose in the halter good
boy good okay so next oh thank
you so there's head shyness there's your
halter into bridling
um again we got to go over some more
steps here I want to make sure he's
going to be okay so that would not be
okay if he threw his head up there and I
had to bit my hand it would bang his
teeth so I'm going to play around with
his nose here for a few
minutes uh you know drop your head play
with your nose good boy just like that
good once he's good with this
yeah lower your head just a little bit
more
good good boy now I'm going stick my
finger in his mouth and if he opens his
mouth great and then you're going to
want to start putting one and one
together or one and two together I'm
going have him drop his head right there
put my hand under here and I'm going ask
him to open his
mouth right there good
boy
good and
again right
there good
boy good and
again right there good
boy good
and good
boy okay so next uh after he's good with
that we're going to start putting the
Rope around his head we're going to
lower the Rope just like we do the
bridal and I'm going to get ready to
Bridle them come on you got to open your
mouth there we go there's the bridling
this ear this ear the bridal is now on
and the reason we go to the Rope is cuz
if I bang his teeth it's not going to
hurt him I don't have to worry about
hurting them then we'll go ahead and
take it out good
boy when I put a bridal on a head shy
horse the first time always make sure
the Bridal's bigger than what it's going
to actually fit the horse that way it's
easier to put on and I'm not sitting
there trying to get a ear in or I'm not
sitting there trying to uh uh you know
put pulling on him or putting pressure
on his mouth
um where oh you're right good
boy yeah you're just fine good boy so
I'm going come down
here
oops there you go oh what a good
boy then I'm come over right here I'm
going gently open his
mouth Slide the bit in this this year
