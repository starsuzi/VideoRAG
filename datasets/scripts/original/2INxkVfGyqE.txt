I'm Sarah fky online instructor for

I'm going to show you a quick tip for
making perfect applique circles with no
fuss really really quickly you're going
to need a piece of foil just regular
foil from your kitchen a piece of
cardboard just an old cereal packet or
something like that that's cut to the
shape the size of the circle that you
want and you need something to trace
around the circle with
um so you can use a white marking pen a
2B pencil or just anything that won't
show
through I'm going to trace around the
outside of the
circle all the way
around and then cut it out using a scant
Quin seam allowance which I've already
prepared once you have your circle cut
out you're going to put the shiny side
of the foil face down
and put the fabric on the top face
down and then put the
cardboard onto the fabric and line it up
with the circle that you
drew put your fingers in the
middle and you're just going to
pull the foil
up around the
circle nice and
tightly and then turn it over to the
front and run your finger around to make
sure that you don't have any little
creases or points because those creases
and points will be there after you've
ironed it if you don't smooth them
out so once you have your circle all
nice and smooth you put the crumple side
face down onto the ironing
board and give it a nice long press with
the
iron and once you're happy that
that's nice and hot give it a minute to
cool down so you don't burn your
fingers and then you can open up
your little package from the
back and pull out the
cardboard and you have a circle that has
a beautiful crease on it that's all
ready for you to turn under an applique
with hardly any fuss at all this will
work for circles and ovals it'll work
for any smooth round shape at all so it
will save you lots of
time I'm Sarah fky instructor for
