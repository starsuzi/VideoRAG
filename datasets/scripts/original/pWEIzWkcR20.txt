here in my shell a I have a very nice
dry bath
it has a nice skylight a nice big shower
um toilet and a nice sink however as you
may notice the shower and the sink are
starting to turn yellow and here's an
example you can see how it's turning
yellow and the sink
is turning yellow and that is primarily
because of the nice skylight a lot of
Sun comes in there and it's just
yellowing the plastic floor of the
shower and the plastic sink so my goal
today is to try to reverse that and make
them wait again so stay tuned to reverse
that yellowing trend I'm going to use a
few ingredients the primary one being
this salon care for tea it's mostly
hydrogen peroxide in a cream form so it
doesn't dry out as quick with I need a 2
inch paintbrush to sort of spread it
evenly saran wrap to cover it and make
it activated you need sunlight now
because I'm inside I can't have sunlight
so I bought a 10 watt UV light so I can
use that in the shower area so these are
what I'm going to use to turn everything
wait again well I'm gonna try it on the
sink I clean it all up
[Music]
so now I'm good
[Music]
brush this on
nice and even then put the saran wrap
over the top to keep it as moist as as
long as possible but here goes nothing
[Music]
this is how I ended up actually clamped
the UV light to the door and had it
shining straight into the sink and it's
been there for about six hours so now
it's time to take it apart and see
I think it is pretty good
[Music]
here's proof it does look better is a
perfect day I would say it's imperfect
but it's much much better than it was
now to try it on the shower
it's made this wooden frame now I have
to cover it with some glass
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
there
now I have a seal the time okay now it's
time to try the tub first things first
[Music]
final we're gonna put a nice even coat
around the whole thing I guess I'll do
an area then another area
[Music]
[Music]
okay here we go
[Applause]
there
now a few pieces of tape just to make it
a little more hair tight
[Music]
because today was such a rainy overcast
day I actually went out and got a second
UV light one of the rights a 10-watt no
one on the left's a 9 watt UV light and
I think it's working but it's taking a
lot longer than if it had some direct
sunlight so we'll just have to wait and
see how it comes out okay it's been
about nine hours and it's time to take
this apart and see if it's still yellow
or if it's turn somewhat white at least
so
[Music]
so let's see
[Music]
Wow that is much whiter much much wider
now we wiped it down
Wow just by looking at you see that's a
lot whiter and here's my final test
so there it is that is a lot whiter
sweet
