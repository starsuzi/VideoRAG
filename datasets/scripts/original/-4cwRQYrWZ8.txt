Norfolk Island pine at growplans.org
easy plant to grow require quite a lot
of place
it's not aggressive
this is a young tree actually this is
like five to seven years I can't recall
how many years
and have small Pines that are edible
but
you need a female tree and male tree
and you should consider maybe to graft
it or plant the mail outside of your
territory
to get just the pollination without to
grow another trees it won't bear
your fruits but mostly and generally
it's grow for ornamental use because
it's very beautiful tree
but I love the Pines
this one don't bring the plants it's
take a lot of years and patience to get
the Pines
as you can see
um
it's not required too much
to prove not really maybe just Dead
Leaves I would consider that's all
but when you grow it you should take the
place as a very high factor because it's
huge tree next to it you can't really
grow
a lot of things because it will kill
them after a few years so you need a big
Garden or just to plant it outside of
your garden it will give you the
benefits of the Pines
and a beautiful tree next to your home
