- Hey guys, what's up?
This is Seth.
Wanted to show you a little pro tip today.
If you're ever doing a survey on land
or a house that you own,
something I would recommend
is to find some kind of a permanent marker
to indicate where the
corners of your lot are.
Whenever you get a survey,
usually the surveyor's
gonna go out there and
pound something like this
into the ground just to
mark where the property
boundaries are and
that's all good and fine
but the problem is, this
is not a permanent fixture.
This is the kind of thing that over time
is gonna decay or someone's
gonna knock it over
or maybe even some
neighborhood kid is gonna
stop by and take it out
of the ground and use it
as a sword or something like that.
So don't stop at this.
What I'd recommend,
especially if it's a type
of property with, you
know grass that's mowed
or something like that,
get one of these things.
This is a survey marker that is meant to
basically be not necessarily permanent
but a longer lasting solution
and I'll show ya what I mean.
When you stick it on the
ground you don't need
any tools or anything.
As you can see, I mean,
it's not really obnoxious.
It doesn't like jump out
at you but you can see it
and it's not the kind of thing where
you know, anything is
ever gonna knock it over
or break it off.
And something else you can actually use,
say if that is not visible enough for you,
that comes in a few
different colors by the way.
You can get it in brown,
or green, or steel,
or orange like that is,
but if that's not visible
enough for you, you can also
get one of these washers.
How this works is you take
this, you stick through this
and it's even more visible.
So you just put it in there like that
and you can see what I mean,
you can definitely see that,
you're not gonna miss
it, you can mow over it,
and it's not gonna be a problem.
And I think this is
definitely the kind of thing
that can work say if you're
in a residential neighborhood
or have a property that's
gonna be maintained
on some level.
Another option, say if you
have a survey on a property
that's out in the forest
or something where leaves
are gonna fall over it would
be to take like an actual
fence post and dig a hole
and plant that fence post
in there or you could get
a giant rock or a brick,
or something that's going
to basically not move.
Or you can stick it in
the ground, it's not gonna
go anywhere, but it's also not the same
as a wooden stick that can
decompose or break off over time.
If this kind of thing
looks interesting to you,
I'm gonna include a
link to both this thing
and this thing beneath this video.
These are actually two different items.
You can just get this if you want
or if you want to make
it even more visible
you can include this on it.
So just thought I'd pass that along.
I'm not sure how often you get a survey
but whenever you do be sure
you use something like this
that you can, you know, leave
more of a lasting marker
so that you don't lose
track of it over time.
Hope that helps, thanks for watching,
see ya next time.
