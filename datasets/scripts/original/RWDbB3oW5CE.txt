here one of my favorite things and this
is the most despised little weed it's
called onion Weed but I love it so
beautiful just like a little snow drop
really from it as far as I'm concerned
it's a weed and people around Sydney
hate it but I love it grows all around
the river at Forbes in Western New South
Central Western New South Wales it's
gorgeous there's thousands of them
growing there I just want this little
one that came here here to uh spread its
seeds and to just be everywhere even has
a nice perfume I suppose it's a little
bit oniony but it's lovely onion Weed
it's called I think it's fabulous I
don't know why it's so despised I don't
despise it God it's gorgeous reminds me
of snow drops and it's too hot for snow
drops out here really I have a few snow
drops oops there goes a bad little
cat there goes a bad little cat making
trouble
oh here's another onion Weed the little
cats asleep today the little cats asleep
today oops this is another one I want
them to grow wild I love them I want
them to grow wild
everywhere they have perfume they're
drought Hardy they're little
survivors I think they're one
wonderful they're poor I suppose you
could call them poor men's snow
drops I think they're pure and
beautiful
