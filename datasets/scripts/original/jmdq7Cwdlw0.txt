chef hendrick here and i'm going to make
you a delicious little parmesan crisp
they're wonderful on top of
all kinds of things like risotto and
pasta
and salads you know it's a nice little
crunchy cheese is what it's all about
pan spray
shredded parmesan cheese
and a saute pan we're gonna take our
saute pan stick it in the oven 400
degrees and get it hot
so we can cook it
the pan is straight out of the oven a
little spray
and sprinkle
parmesan cheese
enough to coat the bottom
of the pan
just like this you you can leave a few
gaps but you know it's best to put
enough
so that it covers the bottom so that the
crisp is going to be pretty solid with a
few little holes the cheese has started
to melt in the pan so now back to the
oven
so that it rounds lightly and gets nice
and crispy
the cheese is bubbling nicely in the
oven
let it cook until it gets some color
it's hot out of the oven
it's still bubbling a bit and you want
to loosen it from the pan here on the
edges it's best to use your spatula and
just loosen the edges like this then get
underneath it a little bit
so that it doesn't stick to the pan and
move it onto the cutting board just like
that i'm gonna let it cool down just a
smidgen
and then take your knife
while it's still warm
and cut it in whatever size
you want
so you have some beautiful
parmesan crisps
you see that
it makes a beautiful decoration
for a dish not to mention that they're
delicious
tasty and crunchy parmesan crisps
