rat trap Productions we teach you how to
do stuff today what I'm going to do is
show you how to put in a inground or
invisible fence for a pet or
animal uh first thing you got to do is
buy the kit um
then decide what your layout is so
basically my layout is going to cover
almost the entire perimeter of my
yard so it's going to come from it comes
from a transmitter that you plug into
the
wall and then the it's wire okay and
that wire you're going to bury you're
going to come out you're going to go
around your yard and you're going to go
back in but what they want you to do
first is lay out all of your wire and
test the system once you know it works
then bury it and that's smart just don't
make fun of this I just moved into this
place and we haven't taken care of this
yet this is supposed to be sheathed or
it's supposed to be in the wall so I did
not do that I'll take care of that
later but here's the system so I have
the surge protector installed I have the
power supply for the transmitter
installed on that I'm going to hook up
my Loop to these
and then so I'm going to have one out
it's going to run around my property
when it comes back it's going to have
twists in it and it's going to go back
in here then it's going to come out of
here and it's going to go into the
transmitter so that that can communicate
but we want everything to go through the
surge protector before it goes to the
transmitter so if a lightning if
lightning strikes we won't have that
problem now run this wire I'm going to
staple it in I'm going to use these stap
I'm going to use these staples because
I'll be able to easily take the wire out
because I'm going to have to twist it
later as it returns so I'm going to need
to actually take this out to do the
twisting you might run out of wire and
if you do you got to splice it
so what you do
take this
piece and you take your new
wire
okay you put those ends
together take your wire
tie you put it in
this buried in that Mucky
muck
okay down as far as you can put one end
in here one end here put this
down boom so the return wire comes here
that's the send wire the yellow wire is
the wire that goes out creates a loop
the red is what I had to splice cuz I
ran out of yellow so the Red's the
return and the twist start s here so now
I'm going to just put it underneath
everything and work it back up so our
wire comes down it's twisted at least
one twist every inch or so we've done
even more that goes in the surge
protector this is the transmitter that's
plugged into the surge protector comes
out of the surge protector I twist those
wires and I put it into the
transmitter now as soon as I turn it on
if everything's set right I have two
light on one says my Loop is good and
one says I have power to the
transmitter so you can see where I'm
working it under I worked it under the
Rock and then when it got to this what I
do is I take
a
shovel work it back and forth a little
bit to create just enough of a trench
get my fingers in there
if I missed I missed right
[Music]
there work it in work it
in work it
down
okay squish it down
just keep doing that 100 ft now this is
my boundary width control when I set it
to 10 I get that Loop light that that um
comes on and it's not beeping anymore
now what I need to First do is I'm going
to turn this
down until it starts to
beep then I'm going to go up two numbers
so I'm roughly on one go up to three
that's where I'm going to start my test
from when you first turn it on it's
going to flash a number in red beep beep
beep beep beep that means it's on level
five beep beep beep that means it's on
level three that's the strength of the
of the Shar after that it's going to
beep it's going to uh illuminate once
every 5 seconds if it illuminates red
that means your battery is weak it's
going away time to order a replacement
if it's green every 5 Seconds that means
your battery is good you're ready to
rock and roll so I'm going to turn it on
and I'll show you it'll go through the
cycle strength first one two 3 four five
okay so it's on number five now we're
going to wait and if if it's red we
order a new battery if it's green we're
good to go green you see
it this is my test tester and my test
light I take the
two connections and I put them here I
make sure that the self correction
button the the diodes are up and the
self correction button is facing the
line or the wire
okay like this now I'm going to get to
the dog's height and I'm slowly going to
walk to the fence when I hear beeping
beep beep beep beep beep beep that means
I'm at the warning the warning track
basically okay if I keep going the light
will light meaning the Shocker is going
off so I'm walking I'm
walking and it's going off right here
so for me that's not far that's not far
enough away from the field so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to turn the
knob up clockwise to a higher number
until I achieve the desired warning
distance okay so I'll went another maybe
24
in right here perfect if I'm happy with
that so I'm going to place a flag this
is going to be a visual signal for the
dog to kind of train it to say hey whoa
whoa you go past this flag you're going
to get
shocked but I'm pretty happy with this
so what I'm going to do with the
transmitter is just walk the field and
wherever I see
best thing going off or hear this thing
going off I'm going to put a flat at rat
trap Productions we teach you how to do
stuff today I taught you how to install
an invisible fence system for a pet
