Alright the drink we are about to make is
called the Fizzy Fuzzy Navel. So if you are
a big fan of the Fuzzy Navel, you want to
add a bit of fizz, go ahead and make yourself
a Fizzy Fuzzy Navel. Lets add our ice to the
glass. And measure out one shot of peach schnapps
and two ounces of orange juice. There we go.
Now we are just going to fill it the rest
of the way with champagne, that's going to
give our fizziness to our fuzzy nave. Alright
grab your spoon and we'll stir all this together.
This is a great morning drink or brunch drink,
maybe something to use as a hair of the dog
after a rough night before. Set up a Collins
glass and go ahead and pour it in. Straw and
bottoms up.
