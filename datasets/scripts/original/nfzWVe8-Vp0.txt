hey so here are the paint splattered
pants that I just made in an outfit the
blouse is from Ann Taylor the jewelry is
my heart my Lulu frost necklace that I
always wear these two and a multicolored
twinkler that I made my love bracelet
and my silver cuff no rings and this is
a makeup forever like red orange
lipstick shoes are Ann Taylor they're
new
I bought them I did the Navy Pier and I
bought him in pink - they're super
comfortable they were 40% off and they
are very similar to my Clark's
pair that I always wear so let me back
up and show you
