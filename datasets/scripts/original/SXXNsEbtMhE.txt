so hey guys and welcome back to another
episode of Amy's corner so uh I got an
adventure plan today which all started
yesterday when I got a message from
Andrew uh the young guy that worked with
us at the shop saw a post someone left
in a group that he's a member of and
that post is these pictures right
here look at this derelict old purple
sonnet look how deep in the in the the
look at that just look how deep in the
dirt that thing is but he
uh he sent me the the link and I saw
these pictures and on the on the uh
Forum that he had it on the group it it
just had a ton of attention a ton of
people asking where it was uh where they
can find it but he mentioned that he
didn't want to tell anybody where it was
for for certain
reasons so uh so I got a hold of him
last night I sent him a message uh I
made a couple of posts about it and he
contacted me back and talking back and
forth he he told me where the car was
and uh I was able to find it on a
satellite picture it's hard to see but
there it is right
there
now if I look it's really hard to tell
if that's it or not but I'm looking at
over here these pickup trucks you see
these pi pickup trucks you know about an
inch inch and a
quter long your average pickup truck and
then you look at this thing it's maybe
3/4 of an inch long on the map you know
which tells me it's a it's a little
either it's a golf cart or a Sonet right
there in the woods so uh so with the
internet I tracked this thing down so
today we're going to go take a road trip
in this my Sonet and we're going to see
if we can find this Sonet now my plan
for this Sonet is to just to leave it
where it is but knock on the doors uh
around where it is you know knock on the
neighbor's doors the door of the the
house closest to it and see if I can get
the history of this little Sonet um I
bet you that Sonet has some pretty good
stories to tell and we're going to see
if we can find all right guys I'm way
out here in Weir New Hampshire in The
Boondocks down some Logging Road pass at
your own risk not Town maintained Road
you know Sonic behaved drove off all the
way up here I actually did take it down
the highway just to uh kind of cut the
time down to get out here but uh here's
uh here's that house I saw on the
satellite view and uh well I guess
there's one other thing that has a short
wheelbase like a on it and that would be
an old Jeep an old Jeep CJ right
there so uh that's what I saw on the
satellite view but I'm in the I'm on the
road I'm in the general
area just I just wanted that to be the
car I'm looking for but uh he said it's
on the right side which would be that
side and this road uh he also said it
was next to a house or near a house and
uh these are the last houses on this
road so there aren't very many other
houses I'm going to I'm going to walk up
and down the road and uh keep peering
off into the woods and see if I can find
it and uh if I can't I'll just knock on
some door or if I see anybody out and
about I'll ask if they've seen that car
uh I'm sure it's been out here for 30
years rotten away so so someone's
probably seen it so uh yeah I'm going to
I'm going to walk down the road and see
if we can find this thing awesome news
boys I found it I found it uh I haven't
taken a look uh I met this nice lady at
a house over there named Kathy and I
asked her if she's seen the car I showed
her a picture of it and uh At first she
said no I've never I haven't seen a
purple car rotten and and she said but
there is a car right over here rotting
away and uh it was right almost right
across the street from where she was and
and there it was we're going to just uh
get in the sawet bring it down a pocket
close to it and
uh take a look at this thing and knock
on the door where it's at and uh see
what uh see what comes of it so uh ready
for a treat here you ready for a treat
here was a hell of a trip to get up here
it was a fun little
ride but uh oh
man oh man
look at this huh guys look at this
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
well it's not an original purple car
that's for sure looks like it was an
original orange just like mine it's an
original orange car looks like it uh
looks like it was painted blue
once and then painted purple on top of
that so uh it's not an original purple
car
wow wow guys look at this thing
H
holy holy
boys
wow wow look it's got the original radio
in
it it's got the original radio in it oh
we don't want to lose that do we we
don't want to lose that we'll put that
right
there what do you think guys
huh I don't know I don't know if this
thing's going to ever move I don't know
if this thing's ever going to come out
of here
boys wow what a shame though what a
shame to just be rotten out
here oh but the fiberglass looks like
well at least what I can see of the
fiberglass looks like it's in decent
shape look at this huh buried right down
right in the moss in the peak the sand I
see soccer ball Wheels there a soccer
ball wheel in the
trunk looks like there's a
might be another soccer ball I I can't
tell I can't tell
boys how about this huh how about
this boy I'm anxious to see just how
rotted out the underneath is sometimes
being buried in dirt like this is is a
bad thing sometimes it's not sometimes
it actually helps to
preserve wow I wish I brought a shovel
but I don't really want to go digging
around yet I want to go knock on the
door over here and see if this gentleman
next door is is available or home or
people are around to uh to maybe have a
little word with this
car
wow wow
[Music]
huh old Saab soccer ball
wheel what a relic huh what a
relic I'm sorry this happened to you I'm
sorry this happened to you Sai let's see
if we can make it better huh let's see
if we can make this
better I I'm kind of I'm kind of God
struck I'm kind of gods smacked right
now I don't know what to say about it I
just don't know what else to
say wonder what it is about this area
that let this car sink in I mean
uh looks like the date on the license
plate
two of
89 so uh yeah it's been it's been here a
while it's probably sitting here about
as long pretty much as long as my car
sat where it's at but uh my car failed a
little better I believe uh you know look
like not a lot of glass survived just
that driver's door
glass I wonder why that is I wonder I
wonder what
happened well anyways guys I'm going to
go uh shut you down we got a little
Farmhouse over
here this doesn't necessarily look like
it's on their property but I'm guess
they're going to be the ones to ask to
see what uh what the story with this
thing is so anyways guys let me uh now
I'm going to go knock on the door and
just see what the story and uh and what
has to happen to try to get this old uh
this old derx Sonet out of
here it's going to be a lot of work the
uh I'd say the uh the price of Eggo
is going to be pretty
much above the cost or the value of the
the Sonet but uh a few things I
noticed there are areas on the car that
aren't as rotted out as my Sonet is so
uh you know the the trunk and all the
supports in the trunk on my car were
completely rotted out and uh this car
here the trunk is in a lot better shape
that's about the only thing I can really
get a good look at I really can't I'm
not going to go digging in you know I
didn't bring a shovel which is what it
would take to even look at anything more
on this car is to dig it out but
um initial indications seem that that
car the the chassis on that car might
might be in better shape than uh than
the chassis on this one was when I got
it isn't that a trip huh but that car
half buried in the dirt could be better
underneath than my daily driver son it I
think that's interesting I uh I really
want to see how this story ends so
uh so yeah this is the house right here
there's a house right here and I'm going
to go uh go knock on the door and if I
don't get any answers then I'll leave a
card and uh we'll see if we can get a
little more information I'll uh I'll
leave the camera recording in my pocket
and if I get a chance to pull it out
while we're talking I'll uh I'll do that
let's uh let's go see what the rest of
the story is on this thing shall
we figure we'll drive in with the Sonet
maybe they'll know why we're here
husky
dog hope he's
friendly all right boys I'm going to put
you in my pocket see if I don't get
attacked by this dog or shot by some
farmer so uh I'm going to keep keep you
guys going in my pocket and we'll see
what uh we'll see what we can find out
shall
we hey
you you guys don't get a lot of visitors
huh mind if I go knock on the door you
look at here all right with it all right
boys I'm going put you away for a
second being watched
no no one here or
something hey big
guy anybody here nobody
here just asking about the car in the
woods you know anything about
