Hi, I’m Jeff Patterson with Home Repair
Tutor, and in this video I’m going to show
with you how to clean a greasy range hood
and range hood filter.
This is a terrible job.
It absolutely stinks having to do it.
But I’m going to show you a quick and easy
way to accomplish it with remarkable results.
So let’s get to it.
I really think you’re really going to like
this video.
Here’s my greasy range hood.
Yuck!
Pretty disgusting, right?
It’s just caked full of grease.
And here’s the range hood filter.
I just popped it out by pressing the spring
release.
And there’s the greasy side of it.
And the product that I’m using is called
Super Clean.
You can find it at a lot of well-known stores.
And what I like is it works fast and it’s
biodegradable.
Three things here, though.
Make sure that you pre-test, you don’t allow
it to dry, and you wipe off your surface with
water.
So again, here’s the range hood filter.
And what I’m going to do is put it in a
baking sheet and spritz off the surface using
Super Clean.
It immediately started to work, but I let
it sit for 5-7 minutes.
And then I rinsed it off using a watering
can just because my watering can was sitting
there and I wanted to see if that would work,
and sure enough, it did.
And I didn’t even use a sponge to clean
the rest of the filter.
I just used my gloved hand, which you should
always wear gloves when any chemicals.
And I soaked it some more in the water.
And there you go, voila!
Looks pretty amazing, right?
Now, for the range hood, what I did is I stuck
a paper towel down into the crevice because
I’m going to test using the Super Clean
on the right side.
So that’s what I did.
I spritz it down, and all the excess Super
Clean went down into that crevice and got
collected by the paper towel, but you can
see  there’s so much grease on this
range hood that the Super Clean started working
immediately.
There’s the right side that I treated.
Here’s the left side – pretty greasy still.
So I wanted you to see the “before” – the
greasy side – and then the “after” and
how well the Super Clean works.
So what I did was I sprayed some additional
Super Clean on a towel and wiped off the bottom
of the range hood.
 just look how much grease is there.
And then I rinse it off and got it streak
free by using a wet paper towel, a damp paper
towel.
Pretty awesome stuff!
Well, I thought the results were amazing.
And the coolest part is it took less than
10 minutes.
