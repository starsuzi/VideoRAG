All right, we're ready to remove this tree
stump.
And what we have is the appropriate tools
to dig around half meter to a meter around
the tree.
We have an axe, a mattock, shovel, crowbar
as required to lever the tree stump out, rake
to clean up, and even a small pruner to cut
into the smaller roots as we come across them.
All right, now that we've dug around the tree
trunk and exposed the roots, you'd use a pruning
sword to cut through the thumb size roots
and an axe for the larger wrist size roots.
What we've done is dug underneath the stump
to give us easier access and to lever the
whole tree out of position.
So I'll cut the remaining roots and see how
we can free this up.
Here we go.
And done.
And that's how to remove a tree stump.
