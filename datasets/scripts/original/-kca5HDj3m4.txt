hey there you guys welcome back today we
are going to be looking at the daas do
you remember last fall we dug up these
delas and uh I don't know they fell
apart and I just ended up storing them
in the basement just in this just in
this tray and I didn't have any Peete
Moss didn't have any other
um other media no uh no wood shavings no
anything so uh I was kind of leery I
thought that they would just uh dry out
um and get all shriveled and and not
look very good well that's not the case
as you can see here got a nice growth
growing on there like a
potato also on some of these uh little
roots that people said probably would
not grow because they needed uh a bit of
the base uh we've got a little Sprout
here actually on this one there's
there's a few
a few growths I don't know whether
you're able to see it here but off to
this side there's a another little red
Spike there but uh what else is
here this one here is doing amazing look
at that it's got three three
growths and then this one here I didn't
think that this one would have anything
but uh this one here is also starting to
grow can you see that so we're going to
plant these in the garden I've already
planted one so I'm just going to dig a
hole and then uh plant them so that the
uh the crown is about an inch under the
ground I don't want to plant them too
too deep so I'll take you along and
we'll uh we'll plant these
up we'll just dig a little
hole I had some cinnamon on the ground
here just because uh we had ants
cinnamon is great for getting rid of
ants they were gone within a
day
smells nice now that I'm digging in
it smells like cinnamon
buns okay so it got a nice size hole
here now I'm going to take the uh the
root here we're going to make sure that
it fits in the hole so I'm going to have
to dig a little bit
more there we go this one doesn't have
to be deep because they fan out as you
can
see so I'm just going to plant it in
there make it about two in or sorry one
inch below the
ground and it's
great normally I would plant these
sooner but uh I didn't have any time
unfortunately so also I'm going to put a
label in
there this one is dinner play Delia no
this is a this is the uh chocolate one
this is a brown or a purple uh Delia so
we'll put this in there and we'll just
give it a good water and uh we should be
good to
go more water than
that so until next time everybody happy
growing and it will dry out they dry out
really really quickly uh you'll find
that when you water the water just goes
around the pot and just out so this is a
method to my madness I saw this in a in
a container gardening book they didn't
actually use a
