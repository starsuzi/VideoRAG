course and owner of our cookery School
laucha caly in London today I'm going to
show you an authentic Italian
recipe today I'm going to show you how
to make fater here we've got 500 G of
strong flour I've got 325 mil of water
tepid water I've got 15 G of fresh yeast
but you could use a sachet of 7even G of
dried yeast I've got two teaspoons of
salt and I'm going to put in two
tablespoons of olive oil so to start
away I'm going to put the dry
ingredients in first so the salt goes
into the flour if you had dried yeast
you'd be putting that into the flour as
well then I'm going to mix my
yeast into the
water so if the water is sort of hand
hot really you shouldn't be able to
sense it as to whether whether it's cold
water or hot water just tepid is fine
and then all that water is going to be
poured into the
flour all in one
go into that I'm going to put roughly 2
tablespoons of olive oil that's a good
extra virgin olive oil as well then
using the rounded edge of a do
scraper I'm just going to blend the
liquid into the flour so you can turn
the bowl with one
hand and scrape and push the liquid into
the flour with the
other so now I can't really use the do
scraper anymore so put that to one
side but I can get my hand into the
dough and bring it into a bowl so there
we are I've left the bowl clean and now
I'm going to knead the dough in order to
knead the dough you need to put your
full body weight into it really push the
dough out so you're stretching out those
GL strands of gluten fold it over to
trap the air in and turn it so just
those three simple
movements stretch fold turn so I'm just
about finishing kneading this dough now
and I'll know it's done if it becomes
springy and elastic and it bounces back
to the touch like that can you
see there so I know that's done I'm
going to chafe it which is this movement
here which is trying to move your hands
underneath the ball of dough and if you
really put effort into it you can feel
it in your biceps as you're really
copping the dough like this and
stretching out the top of it because
this will be the top of your
fater so I want that to be nice and
smooth on top and I want all the
crevices underneath to have gone
away pick up your bowl of dough with the
nice soft top there nice smooth top and
really turn it over and wash its face in
the oil bring it back up to the surface
again so the whole thing is covered with
oil and that'll stop it getting a crust
it also means you can literally pour it
out of the bowl later so do be generous
on that extra virgin olive oil now I'm
going to cover the bowl with cing
film and leave it to
rise so this could be say 3/4 of an hour
to an hour depends on the heat of your
house but you want to find a draft free
area that's quite warm but not too hot
to leave your dough to double in volume
right so the fater has been rising for
about an hour in a warm kitchen and I
can see that it's doubled
inze and there are some lovely air
bubbles in the top here so it means it's
had enough air in it it from the
beginning what I'm going to do is just
take a little bit of the oil from the
bowl and get it onto the
tray so that you grease the tray under
where the fater is going to sit so it's
only needs to
be in a sort of oval shape like
this right and now what I can do is I
can slide the dough out of the
bowl onto the tray
okay like this any extra oil can always
be used on top of the
fater wow look at this big bubble here
then you can stretch it a little bit
from underneath pull it out a little bit
to get it bigger but never on top
because what I want to do is to keep
that beautiful rounded edge here then
just using my fingertips
only can push them into the fater
and that gives that typical sort of
dimpled finish that a fater should
have there we are and I'm going to put
some Rosemary on mine you could put some
olives into it you could put um some
cherry tomatoes squeeze some cherry
tomatoes onto the top of it I quite like
the
traditional one with rosemary there we
are whatever flavorings you use on a
fater you must make sure a little bit
too much there must make sure sure that
you push the flavorings down into the
dough that way the flavor goes into the
dough and they don't just burn on top so
the same with olives as well or like
half cherry tomatoes as I said earlier
push that
down to get the flavor
in now the top of the surface here must
be covered with oil so again I've got a
little bit more in my bowl I can pour
that over the top and the oil is going
to stop it forming a crust so that that
yeast can still do its magic and it can
still work on top of the
dough and just because if a catcher
should be a good oily dough a little bit
more for good
luck and that oil will soak into the
dough and make it deliciously moist and
stop that crust forming so we're going
to leave that again probably for around
3/4 of an hour to an hour until it's
again become doubled in volume it's
light and puffy and ready to go in the
oven and only then will I put the salt
on top so we'll come back in an hour
right so now you can see that the ficat
has risen beautifully it's all puffy
underneath the skin I can see little
bubbles of air underneath here and it
has a light and puffy look about it a
good texture to it I'm just going to
gently sink my fingers into it again so
that you really get that kind of dimpled
appearance that a good for catcher
should have pour in a little bit more
olive oil you can see how much got
absorbed from what we had
before and then I'm going to scatter
over a little bit of
salt and I've got a coarse salt here but
one that crumbles quite easily and I'm
going to put it into the oven at 220 for
about 16 minutes now the Pacha is ready
it's been cooking away there for about
16 to 17 minutes at 200Â° so get it out
onto a tray so that it doesn't sweat
underneath get it out onto a rack so the
air can can go around it and this is how
to make
