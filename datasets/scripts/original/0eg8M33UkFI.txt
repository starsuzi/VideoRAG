Hey there, my name is Chipp Marshal.
In this video I want to show you a quick and
easy tip on how to get rid of silverfish naturally.
These insects are not actually dangerous to
humans or pets.
However, they can be very hazardous to your
wallet.
Silverfish destroy food, clothing, wallpapernand
many other things around your home.
So today; I am going to show you a natural
way to get rid of them quickly and inexpensively.
Before we get started, I'd just like to ask

I love and making videos like this to help
people solve their pest control problems.
Ok, The good news is that getting rid of silverfish
will not require an exterminator.
It won't even require any insecticides or
harsh chemicals.
All you need to eliminate silverfish from
your home is a spray bottle, water and orange
essential oil.
This is a simple but powerful recipe for killing
insects in your house; especially silverfish.
Just remember that all orange oil is not created
equal.
You want to make sure that you are buying
a 100%, undiluted, therapeutic grade oil.
And if you need help with that, I just posted
a great page on my blog with quick information
about how to get rid of silverfish naturally.
I will show you where to get the best quality
essential oil, and also where to get the best
price.
On that page, I also posted a few other fantastic
tips about how to get rid of silverfish in
your attic, closet, bathroom and anywhere
else in your home.
These are important steps that you should
know about before you get started.
Also, if you are not excited about diluting
the oil and mixing your own spray, I just
found a pre-made orange oil spray that was
designed specifically for pest control.
This spray is taking the pest control market
by storm and I am very excited about how well
it has been performs.
In addition to killing silverfish, It will
also come in handy for spiders, ants, flies
and many other household insects.
And it only costs a few more dollars than
the oil itself.
So with a few precautions, a little bit of
cleaning and about $10-$15 dollars, you can
permanently protect your home from silverfish.
