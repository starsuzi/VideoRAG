okay one more time I'm going to do
another howto video because I bought
this a chocolate fountain which my kids
are dying to use and I tried to look up
on the uh YouTube on how to do the
chocolate and everybody was just showing
you basically this is a chocolate
fountain you take it out of the box and
this is how you assemble it and there
you go voila chocolate fountain well I
need more I need to know how the heck do
I make the chocolate cuz I'm just a guy
and I don't know how to cook so so let's
do the basics right from the beginning
this is the box it's already been
cleaned processed I got it at a thrift
store for almost nothing okay cool so
this is the
Tower and then this is instructions
which we don't use this is the little
augur bit that takes it
up and here is the base which is really
a heater and keeps the chocolate that
all nice and melty it's got a little
button that says high low and all that
good stuff so first thing is we're going
to plug it
in do the process of magic it
automatically gets plugged in by unknown
means okay it's all nice and clean and
ready and on the button I have got
a of course I'm in a dark dungeon
somebody read that to me since
K what what are those three settings off
heat motor and heat heat motor and heat
okay so we're going to go with
heat get it all nice and heated up okay
now we're going to put the little augur
into the little spry spocket
thing come on get in there and then this
has little three pins 1 two three and
three pins here line up so just put that
in
there behold the chocolate fountain is
now assembled and
complete okay that was it for my v no
okay now the question that I always had
is how do you make the chocolate I know
you needed oil and I know you needed
chip I actually read the instructions
how to make chocolate Okay so the first
thing it says is
3/4 cups of oil vegetable oil whatever
oil so I think we have just enough to do
3/4 cup yay 3/4 cups put that in your
handy dandy
pot put this in the sink for cleaning
later two bags of chocolate kits we got
grelli oh my gosh it's gardelli
gelli I have been corrected by the
wonderful
Christie who by the way is very
beautiful and very awesome my kids are
beautiful but they don't want to be in
the video Kaye already was Kaye head top
of her head
was okay so put the chocolate chips in
the
oil the
sleeve is it girelli or girelli gelli
giradelli
gardelli there we
go that wasn't in the video so it never
happened
somebody's eating chocolate chips then
we take the
pot over to the stove which I've already
got Heating and there we
go they say don't use a wooden spoon
because it has moisture and it does some
funky things with the chocolate and
makes it get all hard and stuff so we're
going to
use
plastic okay and the stove is going so
all it really have happen at this point
is you just stir
it until it
melts this might take a moment or
two so in the meantime we'll talk about
sports sports yeah you're funny I hate
Sports so we're not going to talk about
sport we're just going to watch the
chocolate
milk get it in there look how pretty
that looks
oil yeah take some that way don't you
now that it's all wrapped up
in
oil this is option one by the way the
stove top get off it o it's starting to
melt already look option two is put it
in the microwave I tried the microwave
it did not work out very well it turned
into goo and I wasn't sure what I was
doing so what I did is I took this semi
goop glob concoction and I threw it in
the in the fountain thinking oh it'll
melt it now did the augur just kind of
like and it was horrible I had to take
all of it out again remelt it and then
try it again but afterwards it was
pretty good we ate a lot of
stuff this is almost as good as oh look
at that it's already going big
time this is almost about the time that
I got my deep fryer and we deep fried
everything from apples to sunglasses
to whatever else I get my hands on deep
fryers are fun I think this Fountain is
more
fun check it out look at my goopy
concoction now it's still got a lot of
big old chunks in there
so recommendation is that you just keep
stirring this over and over and over and
over until it all nicely
melts
that was my
daughter that's my youngest who's hoping
to get
taller although she's almost as tall as
me how we doing here we still got
some thick pieces in there so just keep
gently stirring it stir stir stir
stir
I think another minute we'll be good to
go
here I think basically I don't know if I
I grew up in the 70s so I grew up with
the Galloping
Gourmet you're old I know yeah Bing
Gourmet was always he always had a
bottle of wine and he'd always show you
how to cook with cooking cherry and then
you'd cook and then you'd always have a
bottle of beside you you'd pour a glass
of cooking cherry and then you'd pour
some into the food and another glass for
you and by the time you were done the
Galloping G was about three sheets to
the wing that Wonder anyway I love him I
think he's
do so we're going to be cooking until
the consistency is that of liquid base
now there's still some on the bottom
that's sticking and we want to get it
all
and I'm stirring stirring stirring I can
still feel some solid chunky pieces on
the bottom so I'm just going to stir it
some
more there we
go wish I had some cooking Cherry
now yeah I think I got it
all
okay
now at this
point I'm just going to let it sit here
for a
second and I'm going to come back over
here to my do
key get warm and turn it to motor and
heat so now my base is heating my little
motor
spinning actually for now I'm just going
to put Ry there go I don't want to spin
on then I get my
chocolate and just pour my
chocolatte into my
fountain
and I will put all this chocolate over
here in the
sink for later now I'm turning the motor
on
behold the chocolot
fan and now we're going to throw it all
away because the kids don't want to eat
any right
kids once pot
nobody fine I'll take
it and it's got a little bit of room so
I'll just go ahead and pour the rest of
it in here we're going to use it up
anyway and do strawberries
bananas rice krispy treats Rice Krispy
Treats oh is that what the Rice Krispy
Treats are for
yeah
voila and that is how to set up your
chocolate fountain that's it for that
this is my hall to video on how to do
chocolate fountain things because the
ones that I saw online were terrible
mine is better thank you
