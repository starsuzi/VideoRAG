toys are an area where concern for
personal hygiene may be high due to the
time our little ones spend with it this
video shows our process to sanitize toys
that does not have any fabric attached
for this we have brought out a ball an
activity table and a
walker the method of cleaning is
primarily using food grade white vinegar
vinegar is said to be an edible
antibacterial and hence considered the
safest each toy is thoroughly cleaned
with white vinegar to ensure attention
to detail and optimal hygiene this
process is carried out very minutely and
with great care the toys are thereafter
left to air dry once dried the product
is packed ready to be dispatched thank
