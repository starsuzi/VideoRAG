okay uh this is Andy Lange at H hun
Farm I am just going to show how we
clean our
casings um at the
sink uh we have some we butchered a pig
yesterday and we saved all of the
intestines we cut the small
intestines
into 5T lengths it's a manageable length
for for stuffing and for cleaning it's
uh just a nice length easy to measure uh
if you hold it up it's not touching the
ground that sort of thing so this is one
that's been flushed one
time uh just with a sprayer hose after
it came out of the pig um you know we
didn't let it hit the ground we try to
keep it off the ground so it doesn't
collect anything the the outer membrane
can s can pick up a lot
of debris so we try to keep it off of
things so we sprayed it
out got most of the the stuff out of it
and now we're ready to to turn it inside
out so we
can so we can uh clean this inner
membrane off this mucusy sort of stuff
so I take one end um I put two fingers
on both sides if you can not all the
small intestines are actually big enough
to do this and then I'll flip it
around so that I can get water to start
feeding into there and as the water
feeds in I'm just using my other hand to
kind of hold it up up and let it drop in
and once it gets
started you can use one hand to fill and
the other hand to drop so this is
just um how we turn them inside out just
using a little bit of water to force the
rest of the intestine in and you can use
more water you know obviously it'll
speed up the
process it just uh flows right through
there once you have it real
good it'll fall right through chase out
the
end then your intestines inside
out having a tray like this is kind of
Handy and keep the water running keep
the things clean and then once it's
inside out I us use this
tray it's just
a an enamel tray with an old cutting
board in it kind of contains uh
everything so I don't I don't lose my
intestine anywhere down a hole or
anything they're really really slippery
so it's nice to have a way to contain
them and then I find the end again I
leave a little bit of water running just
to keep things
flushing and then I start at one end and
I usually wrap it around a couple
fingers uh just so I can keep a hold of
it because it is so slick and then I
just use a pastry knife or a bench knife
some people call it and I uh flatten it
out and I start scraping with a little
bit of pressure and the little the
little little water that I have running
is kind of nice to keep keep things
flowing and I usually do an initial
scrape get things flat here and then
after my initial scrape I usually do a
secondary scrape I'll fill it with water
after this scraping and then if there's
any um discoloration or spots that I
missed they're really easy to spot when
you fill it with
water and then you can turn it if you
watch my thumb I'll kind of turn it as
I'm scraping sometimes you can also sort
of turn it with your
scraper
um but usually you can get most of it
off the first
running if there's a if there's any of
the outer membrane the F more fatty
tissue that you don't clean off when you
take it out of the pig or when you're
cleaning it out initially with its first
rinse that will sometimes that that can
also get scraped out uh this intestine
here was pretty clean of the fatty
membrane on the outside so uh there
won't be much that comes from the inside
but every once in a while when you're
scraping you'll get something come out
from the what was the outside which is
now the inside you'll get like a little
ball of stuff that'll come out with it
and that's just the lining that you
didn't get off initially the first
time so it's just a matter of doing this
um like I said I do it
twice I'll try to go a little bit
further here and fill this spot with
water so you can see
it you can already see a pretty big
difference between the ones that have
been at least cleaned once and the ones
that haven't been cleaned and most of
that yellow is
gone so then if you want to test to see
how well you've
done you can put a little bit of water
back in it and this one obviously wasn't
cleaned all the way but
for the sake of time I'll fill it up a
little
bit you can kind of
see this is the section I had filled got
a little twisted
there so it's uh it's pretty clean but
something on my finger uh there's a spot
there but for the most part fairly clean
and pretty quick doesn't take too long
and then after these are clean and we've
double checked them uh then we'll just
pack them in um a really salty brine or
just straight salt we usually keep them
in a little bit of liquid just to make
them a little bit easier to use and um
take
out uh that's it if you have questions
let me know but that's how we do it here
thanks
