hi I'm fancy from Cactus Creek I'm
Monita we're back again about this time
last year we did a video on how to clean
a cowhide rug and we wanted to do an
update the 2.0 version of that video
last time we had a
a mess on a height we had no idea what
it was but we showed you how to get a
claim this time we thought we'd show you
a few more of real life things that
happened to cowhides so we got some
serious dirt and grimage going on here
that your child husband dog pet whatever
got a little lipstick in case you have
little romance and then we've got some
Sharpie over here in case the kids get a
little carried away your mama gets a
little bit too much you know when she's
doing her thing doing her DIY that's
right scrapbooking or what have you so
we're going to show you how to take it
all out okay before we do that we wanted
to make sure that you know that and you
have a cowhide we always tell people
they're so super easy to take care of
because all you have to do is vacuum up
or shake them out like you would a
regular rug
um in fact they're easier than a regular
rug it comes out a lot faster with these
than it does with a thick pile
absolutely all right so let's get some
dirt all right we got some dirt
okay the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to get the Sharpie out
hand sanitizer it's always better to
wash your hands but hand sanitizer works
really good for a lot of things and I
didn't realize that hand sanitizer will
take Sharpie out
another thing that will take Sharpie out
is at least in off of the white hide
see it comes right off
always go with the gray you know the
direction that the hair is going it's
just better to do it that way
it keeps it from um
you know you don't want to run it
backwards and if you run backwards with
it backwards with it what will happen is
you'll push it down onto the underneath
and you don't want to do that so just
always go with the hair and it may take
you a couple of times so if it takes you
a couple times to go over it then do it
that way but don't just you know think
oh it didn't work yeah I did
is
see girls it's gentlemen
it doesn't really take any time at all
to get it out and you can see where it
comes out
it's going to be a little bit damp let
it dry away so anytime you do that and
take just a little bit of water and just
wipe off so you're wiping off any of
that crusty residue or any of the
alcohol or anything that's on it
let it dry
go back
and it'll be just fine
all right Sharpie next lipstick lipstick
once again because it's waxy and greasy
use your hand sanitizer a little bit
and always use like don't use a white
paper towel if you've got a dark colored
rug obviously you know try and keep it
it cuts right through the color
and the groin
and then take your Dawn
just a tiny bit
and it comes right out
I have to work it a little bit
and it comes right out
can't do that on a cashmere rug
can't do that on a cashmere rug
or carpet
and I have had my kids ruin two really
nice indian rounds one with ketchup and
one well the dog were in that one and
they both are going to be over two
hundred dollars to get cleaned because
they're such good rugs and with this it
would have just been a few Little
Squirts of the Dawn combed that kind of
comb out some of the
and we would have been finished
when you're cleaning things out if it's
got a color pigment to it
the hand sanitizer takes the color out
the Dawn takes the greasiness the
yuckiness any of the residue that's left
ta-da all right now let's move this dirt
all right
everyday nerd everybody Rags brings it
in doesn't matter
I've got a little Dawn water over here
that's too easy when was the last time
you did that over your brand new carpet
when your kid just walked across it
and it doesn't even matter if it's dog
poop same thing happens yeah so that is
how easy it is to clean a cowhide rug we
always have them on our website and at
all of our shows and in our other
locations just check them out at
