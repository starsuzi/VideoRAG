oh what's up this is kid money kid and
i'm here with little asianpride24 and
we're gonna teach you how to make a
fresh lemonade hand squeeze of course
and first wash our hands first you have
to wash your hands
make sure you drive make sure you dry
your hands
if you have any cuts
then put a band-aid over because we did
this earlier and it like my fingers
started to burn
right here this finger started to burn
because i had to cut there
okay all you all you need is
four lemonades
well it doesn't really matter how many
lemons you know
you need a knife
two cups well two cups if you're making
it for two people
making my kit and
asian fries only four and of course you
need sugar
so sugar right here and a spoon
okay and also um cutting board
all right
so um
okay
okay first step
step you take one lemon
put all three out
cut the sides first
so
cut the sides first like right here
so at the ends at the end so
you can squeeze it easily
and then cut it in half while kingly kid
is doing that i'm gonna show you how to
take out the seeds and do all four okay
so if you look at this you could see
seeds just put your knife in
and take it out like that
make sure some seeds may be deeply in
or you know really good eyes
there also might be a lot of seeds too
so while we do that
some of the juice might come out but
that's okay
see like this one you can't see it but
then there is a seeds
can you there's these deeply in so you
have to have big division or if you
don't just ask your parents or your
brother or sister
if you're
um under 10 do not use a knife
as uh
your parents or older brothers they must
be like 18 or older 18 or older
but we know we're not 18.
so
yeah so we're doing this
after you cut all your um
all the seeds out of your lemons um
double check to see if there's
there's more
there's a lot of seeds
so
just ignore the music av here
we're watching saved by the bell
okay
now put all the seeds to one pile
so they don't get in your way
okay
take one cup
cups all right take a lemon
and squeeze it with both hands like wait
wait before that before that make sure
your friends get equals left so just one
two three four five six seven eight four
for each people okay okay okay now
squeeze it with two hands like this to
get all the juice out or do it like like
or squeeze it like this
but then after you're done make sure you
take all the lemon juice out and then do
it the opposite way i'll show you later
so show them
a lot of juice might pop out so
and then see it's like this so you
squeeze it the other way
and do that
holy crap in here
oh there might be seeds because they
might be very deeply in so
and let's see let's see my
way so this is my way
you see this you use only one hand
since i'm strong
squeeze
all the lemon inside
and touch the inside ace if
that means there's more lemon here oh um
also um don't put your face too close to
the lemons because it might squirt in
your eyes it sometimes burns
like help
so
make sure to take all the lemon juice
out
don't waste lemons
make sure you put the lemon in like in
the cups oh also
when squeezing it put it down first to
take out all the juice
a laptop sweat with lemon
um make sure to clean all right after
this we have to clean the laptop
and then clean everything else
yep i'm up to my fourth lemon so
yo what is your pride what happened yo
no because you i take out all the lemons
lemon juice
damn it some seeds in here
see this is what happens when you don't
take out all the seeds
sometimes you might drink the seeds
by accident
i did that once
i drank i drank orange juice
and if you're wondering how to make pink
lemonade you just put food coloring in
it
and we're not doing that
because we want fresh lemonade
okay
should i help you a little asian bread
you can if you want to
this little girl
okay
there might be seeds in it afterwards
but then the thing is uh you could take
it out with you with your spoon later
all right
okay
can you take out all the seeds in it
i found one
um i think that's it that's it let me
check mine just instead always check
your um
cup after you squeeze all your lemons
because there could be seeds in it
okay
after you finish squeezing the lemons
make sure you wash your hands
okay after that get your sugar
put sugar the lemons out of the
of the board
and just leave the lemons there oh open
it
and then like
get get one spoon first
try to get a spoon like this because
it's small oh it's also a dunk you could
get this at dunking donuts so yeah oh
yeah okay one spoon not full
like this much
like a spoonful right and then put it in
each cup
so this one take out all the sugar on
the spoon
as much as you can
and add one half of sugar
to each cup so it's one and a half um
sugar spoons of
um with your lemons take out all the
excess lemon juice
because there could be
lemons
just wash your hands just instead
oh god just let me juice
oh god
i broke the lemon
i am the new ancient hulk
so this kid
i think i got to see i saw sea fall
down uh
should i just drink the seed no
bags please
okay he's gonna go into me
and just watch his hands again four more
times
it's gonna be your last time washing
your hands again yeah okay and then make
sure you close the lid
of the sugar
stir it one more time just in case
you're mine all
right we did this earlier but we forgot
the video take this for oh you see

right for the sink water wait put the
camera up
for the sick water wait turn it on and i
put a little just a little but it tastes
really good though we tried it earlier
