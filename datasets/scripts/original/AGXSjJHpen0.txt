hi guys today I'm going to show you how
to recycle candle jars but you will need
is a spoon some tissue and some boiling
water okay so this is a candle that's
finished pour the water very hot water
okay wait a little bit and take the
spoon
press for way to the bottom try to cut
it in a few pieces
you
you
keep wiping the jar
until you get rid of all the wax
remove the labels
let's do this is harder to remove like
this but what you need to do is soak it
in water for a little bit and then you
can remove it with your nails are with a
knife or something
after the jar is clean it looks like
this if you like you can add a
decorative piece on the top like I did
these are available at joann's
you
okay so let's say we want to use it for
q-tips just open the jar
and put our q-tips inside
close it here guys so this is how the
jars look like I'm going to use them in
the bathroom to store q-tips and cotton
swabs thank you so much for watching
