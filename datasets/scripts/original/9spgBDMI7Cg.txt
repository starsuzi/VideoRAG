what up y'all it is DJ barbecue in
beautiful Portugal and I'm about to
grill up for your viewing pleasure and
my eating pleasure the best thing known
to man Chita this is beautiful Man 3
days in the making and we're going to
add a bit of fire to this not just from
the grill but with some fir water this
is madronia made from these spiky little
berries and this stuff is crazy it's
actually the base ingredient to Classic
Peri
[Music]
Peri all right here's how we do it watch
this we follow the lines and do a smiley
face all the
way
around about half a cm in then we flip
it and do the same thing on the other
side and there we go okay so this goes
on the grill you
ready they all know madronia is
quite
dangerous it it's pretty much local
moonshine
go why do you drink this
stuff okay I'll put on the charita
charita do you want to try some too
much T bom is the good
stuff you guys are real men here we go
watch out camera dude you
ready okay here we
go there we go so watch the Flames kiss
the meat and already you're starting to
see colorization
happening yeah
woo that's what I want
[Music]
man let get a photo of
that looks cool doesn't it it's had
about 5 minutes on that side with some
madronia and some Flames kissing the
meat now it's time to flip which means
it's time for some more madronia I used
to make jello shots of this stuff back
in like the early
90s
[Laughter]
woo this R and this is Alberto you want
Madonia oh yeah okay more not not in his
belly but on the
uh woo ha that's what you want to see
beautiful I think he's going to give it
all he's all about po he's all about
poking
it
Alberto wanted more flavor and more heat
and more Magonia into the treza so what
he's kind of sliced it up a bit more
opened it all up exposed it for more
flavor and more fire so let's get it in
there we're going do the same on the
other
side you like how I'm working with the
smallest knife
ever I left my tongs in the kitchen
so let's get the
all let's get it up there you show me
how you do it oh I see just make it
little chunks yeah
see it's let not get precious with it
just go for it that Fork's probably
touched raw raw lots of stuff probably
cleans his fingernails with it doesn't
matter makes you stronger and there you
have Chita on the barbecue and we're
going to serve it on some beautiful
local fowl the bread and that bread will
soak up the oils from the trita so I'm
going to put a little bit on top
there oh man fish meal that's that's the
best T I've ever had that Chita is
phenomenal what do you want me to grill
