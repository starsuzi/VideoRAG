look the tilapia are trying to go in and
then the fish swims in see that guys
a molly
what's up raw fam so today we're gonna
be doing an epic video we're gonna go
off and catch some massive mollies with
this huge homemade molly trap let's do
it so the first thing we have to do
today in order to catch some massive
wild mollies these things are super rare
and there's very little spots in florida
that actually have them this big we're
gonna go off we're gonna catch them with
this
but now i'm gonna show you guys how you
guys can do it at home all right guys so
the first thing that you guys need to do
in order to make this trap you're going
to have to cut
this top off let's just look down right
here and uh basically what i have i have
a little
this is a little sharpie
and we're going to make a line
to cut out
and there's a little bit of weird
grooves
for the most part yeah there you go
that's exactly what we're expecting you
see that
and that's just like a rough estimate of
what i actually have
see that
so the first thing we need to do
first thing we need to do get a razor
blade
and make your first initial cut shortcut
right there
there you go you see that
[Music]
all right guys so something a little bit
stronger than those little uh metal uh
pieces we're gonna use zip ties instead
because i know they're a lot stronger
than paper clips what we did is we
basically
made a bunch of holes we drilled holes
with a with a with a drill and then we
drilled holes in here
and then uh we're basically going to tie
it together with zip ties and then we're
going to have our trap
[Music]
[Music]
there
is your your fish cap see
now let's cut off
the loose ends
[Music]
there we go you see so basically you set
it in the water um you fill it about
halfway up and then you put the bread
and stuff that's your bait and then the
fish swims in
and then
he has nowhere to go and you grab this
by the little handle
and you pick it up and then now you have
some rare exotic
mollies
you're welcome you're welcome youtube i
just showed you guys a trick this is how
i get on my mobs
so
and the only thing about this trap guys
is you see this whenever you guys want
your fish to come out um you just cut
that and then you open it up and then
that's how you get your fishies up we
have an epic finished molly trap
oh he's gotta get the thumbnails
alright raw fam so i know i'm in these
little waiters and it's really funny but
we have the fish trap and uh we have our
our catfish food and uh we're gonna just
take this pour it in
[Music]
perfect
and
throw
that over there we're getting bombarded
by animals look
hi guys so i'm showing you guys that
this trap works if this little guy right
here was a fish watch what would happen
swim in
you smell it
oh yes he's trying to go right into the
hole you see the hole look we're just
going to leave the we're going to leave
the trap here
and see let's see how it would work in
the wilds look
how do i get in
[Music]
how do i get in
and there's their opening
so we know that the trap works it's
animal approved now we just got to go
see if it's fish approved
and that's all she wrote oh
blake come help me
oh
and now we shall wait
look at it working
yeah you guys see them going in there
i know we got a bunch of little ones
already in the trap it's been in there
for
probably 30 seconds
but um
yeah i we're going to get so much
different stuff in there it's not even
going to be funny look the tilapia are
trying to go in we're going to get a
huge tilapia bro all right guys so we're
going to let this trap sit and soak
we're going to let it soak for
about an hour
and then we're going to go off check it
and then
whatever we catch we catch 12 seconds
later
open that up
now it's time to see what we got
take all the duck food
cmo
all right guys so that was an epic fail
i mean this it wasn't the trap's fault
it was it was the placer it was my fault
um you guys remember this pond is like
black tar this is the black tar pond
that literally has like 100 a million
700 000 views this pond is basically
black tar and it's nasty and okay i
barely went in and i'm like still
covered in black tar um this thing
filled i literally had to go wash this
thing out this thing filled up with uh
with mud and it didn't allow any food or
bait anything like that to go inside of
this trap long story short i know what
i'm doing now we're gonna go take it and
put it on the other side of the pond i'm
looking for a molly
um i'm not really expecting anything
else there's a bunch of placos in here
so
i mean by default one can swim in
so last time i put way too much junk
food
to where i was pouring out this time i
tried a lot less duck food maybe
maybe it'll work i don't know um we'll
be back in like 30 minutes
and we'll check it then 12 seconds later
gotta get some water um
i mean i hope um the only thing is is
like if we don't get any mollies then we
could still get the minnows that we
because i know we're gonna have minnows
and we could give the minnows to the
clown knife that we got so it's a
win-win the trap should work i mean it
kind of worked last time but i mean i
don't really count that so let's look
this is what we got to deal with guys
come here
guys this is
[Music]
it's like black tar in here guys
i hope it didn't fill up with black
so
[Music]
oh look
look guys
one jumped out see
put him back in
dang a lot jumped out what the heck
so
it's all right guys
a bunch of mosquito fish jumped out
am i here
wanna help me out blake
so whenever the water floods here um
we get these
because they have no idea where to go
gonna keep it yeah i'm gonna hang it up
here you go thanks buddy
that's nasty these are the phone calls
yeah can still work
i already know that it worked um as i
was letting some water out a bunch of
mosquito fish were flying out of there
left and right so that means we will
definitely have fish food for the clown
knife um this is going to be epic it
already works so it's it's it's a win
video already so let's see
i just wonder how many we got
and we got this little
