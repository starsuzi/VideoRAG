if you put too much oil inside your car
when doing an oil change this is an easy
fix you don't need to go to garage to do
this and you don't have to crawl
underneath your
car
and and get out oil from the O oil pan
all you have to do is uh locate your
this dipstick which is right here this
is a 2001 Ford Fiesta with an Endura e
engine so you just pull out your
dipstick you put it put it somewhere
clean and you need a hollow plastic tube
like this not very long depends on how
big your engine is and I have and a
syringe I have a 60 mil syringe the
syringe is bigger then it's easier you
can also do an oil change like
this if you don't have the
means to get underneath your car and do
it you just connect your syringe to your
tube after you put the tube through your
dipstick checking oil whatever and you
just pull it
out it is a little bit time time
consuming but it's very
doable
see you can also connect a
little a little pump to
this hose to this tube and it will work
just fine that's all you need to do okay
that's it
