with the weather getting a bit nicer
we're going to do some watermelon wine I
guess yeah wine sure so I'm going to
chop up these three melons I'm gonna go
into that pot we're gonna add the liquid
just to make things nope not that one
I'm gonna add this cranberry cocktail
just for some added added flavor sugar
and just to make sure we're getting
enough liquid and so we'll boil that
need to simmer I don't know
we'll do something with it and then
she's going in it's going in there let's
go get these chopped up and in the pot
and we will be back so this is uh there
wasn't even two full watermelons and
we're gonna add just a cup of sugar
Oh help get some of the liquids moving
out of the watermelon I'm predicting
this is gonna be a bit of a pain in the
ass so I'm gonna have to simmer this
mash it all up with a potato
masher or something strange out of
it and I'll probably bring it back up to
a simmer I want to bring it up to
temperature just to kill any wild yeast
or bacteria anything that would affect
our fermentation and then our cranberry
cocktail those aren't even the
ingredients this I'm just kind of using
for filler cuz I've said before I don't
like cocktails fruit juices from pear
cranberry apple and raspberry plus some
sugar just gonna help get things moving
so if it adds a little bit of flavor
great if not whatever
yeah this is just under two two melons
oh
should be enough so as I mentioned I got
this on almost almost high and as it
sits and starts to kind of leak out I'm
going to mash it up we're gonna add some
muffin mix to it no we're not
kidding because it's disgusting
yeah I'll mash it up and then we'll be
back hopefully this draining process
isn't too much of a pain in the balls
but we'll see so here is a we simmered
it and mashed it it was glory but
it was awful
so then I put it in a blender and then
strained it through a fine strainer and
then collected it all and here we are
and I'm just going to bring it back up
to temperature and reduce by I don't
know like cup or two and we'll be ready
to cool it down and then pitch our yeast
so we're looking at about 10% so I
so yeah we mashed it we blended it we
strained it report it we cooled it all
this fun stuff and we got it down to
about 160 ounces and if we ferment it
dry it's gonna come in add 10% so we'll
add some nutrient and have not decided
on the strain I'm going to use but yeah
watermelon wine so here it is next day I
expected to make a mess put it in this
bucket too much foam going on there so I
know if using the Lanvin k1v 11:16
hopefully we keep a lot of that
watermelon flavor and I'll probably do a
second video to rack this because this
is one that I expect we'll start looking
one way and end up looking very very
different but watermelon do that yes we
got here
that's the strawberry chocolate apple
cider the dates are applying that didn't
seem to do anything that is a mold in
agree that I'm working on cider there's
some pomegranate wine cranberry pari
orange soda yeast growing cranberries
soda there's a big ol white wine there
red wine this is a bucket of the had
almost 20% of all the Apple syrup Apple
syrup apple cider lemonade was the
orange vanilla in the back raisin wine
more cider empty bottles kind of wine
ginger bug it's quite a mess in here
actually you should spend some time and
clean the up
