let's get started on making an Ambrosia
cheesecake what an awesome combination I
thought so
too first up start by greasing your
spring form baking
tin and cut a piece of baking paper to
shape to line it with for the base I use
3/4 each of a packet of plain Scotch
fingers and white chocolate tin
TS it's easiest to seal in a bag and
using a rolling pin smash it up into
fine
crumbs Mount 100 G of butter and mix
into the Biscuit
[Music]
Crumbs pour it into the baking tin and
even it out with the
fork and a trick is to use a flat bottom
glass to press it all together and to
make it
flatly put your base in the freezer
while you do your
filling first ingredient in the mixture
is 300 M of cream whip it until it
reaches a soft
Peak and then set
aside you'll need 400 G of cream cheese
use a stick blender to try and make it
as smooth as you
can next ingredient is 450 M of your
favorite Berry
Yogurt and then add it into your cream
cheese and give it a good stir
through next add half cup of sugar to
sweeten it I use a sugar alternative
natural
Stevia next step is the gelatin to hold
your cheesecake together use one packet
or 3 teaspoons to half cup of boiling
water mix until dissolved and then set
aside to cool
slightly and now the fun stuff chop up a
good couple of handfuls of
marshmallows and now you can add any new
gelatin to the mix and stir
[Music]
while add in your whipped
cream and mix all
[Music]
together add your
[Music]
marshmallows I've chopped up a few
strawberries
add a couple of handfuls of
blueberries and I chopped up some dark
chocolate buttons into
[Music]
pieces secret ingredient just using a
couple of the leftover temp Tams from
the base and chopping them as well to
add
them
grab the base from the freezer and it's
time to pour the filling
in smooth the top and then place in the
freezer for about half an hour to firm
up
[Music]
quickly and now it's perfect to start
decorating I've chopped out the rest of
that chocolate very
finely and cut some extra strawberries
Into Thin
slices
Place evenly around the edges and
Alternate with blueberries in the
[Music]
middle sprinkle that chocolate around
the sides in a circle or ho you
[Music]
please I just sort of made this up as I
went
along just get creative and have some
fun with
it
I then placed it in the fridge for about
4 hours until it was ready to
go when it's time to serve run a sharp
knife around the edges very carefully
and then slowly remove the
[Music]
tint W looks almost too good to
eat and trust me it tastes even better
than it
looks not to brag or anything but I took
this to a dinner party and got told I
was the queen of
cheesecakes thanks for watching don't
