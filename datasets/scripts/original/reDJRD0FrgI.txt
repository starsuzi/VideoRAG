this is the giant cicada killer wasp, a gentle
giant among wasps.
up to two inches long.now, harmless to people
for the most part, but if you're a cicada,
it's intended victim, you've got a problem.
This female wasp is actually preserving and
paralyzing that cicada with its venom, for
the future generation to feed upon.
Now she will drag that cicada, that is basically
'knocked out', into her burrow.
She'll put it in a chamber and lay a single
eggs upon it.
Future males will receive a single cicada,
where as the females will receive up to three.
The eggs hatch in the late summer.
And the larva soon begin feeding upon the
hapless cicada.
They completely consume it and by late fall
they begin pupation
and will overwinter in that stage of life.
Not to remerge again
until the cicada's song is heard again next
July.Cicada killers, the gentle giants.
