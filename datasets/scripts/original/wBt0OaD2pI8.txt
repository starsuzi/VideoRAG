hey y'all i'm april mckinney and today
i'm making a recipe for salmon cakes
with a creamy lemon dill sauce it's
really delicious easy to put together
great for a busy week night we're
starting to get back into our routine
school starting back and this is going
to be a great weeknight dinner so what
i'm starting out with is one can of
salmon i'm actually doing half the
recipe in this video so down below where
you see the full recipe it'll be double
from what i'm doing in the video so like
i said some salmon here i've got six
ounces you can cook your salmon and just
flake it if you want to use leftover
salmon or you can use the kind of can
just make sure you drain it really well
either one works i usually use the can
just because i always have it on hand
but
all the more power to you if you're
using the fresh so got our salmon ready
and now i'm putting in some onions and a
one clove of garlic that i've just
softened in a skillet i like the flavor
that this adds
i like this better than adding raw
onions to it
i don't know i just don't like the
crunchiness of the raw onions
in these salmon cakes
so
get my cooked onion my garlic is going
to add some really great flavor to this
now i'm going to add some panko bread
crumbs now this is sort of my way again
of updating the recipe my mom probably
used to make this recipe with maybe
saltine crackers or flour or something
like that but i'm using the panko it's a
really nice crispy breadcrumb you can
find it right with the regular
breadcrumbs in the grocery store very
easy to find now
let's just sort of mix that up a little
bit
now i'm going to add an egg of course we
have to have a binder to this
just crack that
and there we go
okay
this was one of my favorite
actually it was my favorite dinners
growing up my mom would make these and i
just really liked them she would make
them with tuna sometimes or salmon and i
do the tuna patties a lot now
and they're very very delicious
okay so
this is all mixed up pretty well now i'm
going to get some seasoning in here
because we always have to have some
seasoning so about a half of a teaspoon
of i'm using a fish rub seasoning but if
you have just a seasoned salt that'll
work good too
and then some fresh ground pepper
worcestershire sauce gotta have a little
bit of this always adds a lot of good
flavor
and some lemon zest
again my mom probably didn't put lemon
zest in hers but this is another way to
just brighten up the flavors of this
keep it really fresh
i'm just zesting a tablespoon in there
sorry a teaspoon
okay
looking good
okay
it's well mixed i'm going to set this
aside
i'm going to get started on the really
simple lemon dill sauce
all right i've got my ingredients out
for my lemon dill sauce i'm starting out
with some fresh dill i love
how this smells i don't use fresh still
a lot i should probably use it more
often
but this is it's a really great herb and
it goes perfectly with salmon so i'm
just going to chop a little bit of this
up
maybe about a tablespoon or so
not to chop it up too finely
you kind of want people to know that
there is fresh dill in this sauce
and you could use the dried dill but
you're just not going to quite get the
same effect as you will with the fresh
so i really recommend using the fresh
i'm going to add some sour cream that's
the base to this sauce it's just light
sour cream
right into my bowl
then i'll go ahead and get my dill in
there
okay i'm going to be using
some lemon juice fresh lemon juice
about a tablespoon you want to put equal
parts of the dill to the lemon juice
into your sauce
so i'll get that in
perfect now i'm going to add actually a
little bit of honey to this probably
wouldn't expect that but i always like
to add a little something sweet
especially if i have a really tart sauce
like this just to balance out the
flavors i'm just going to add a ton
i'm just getting a ton i'm just going to
add a tiny bit
nobody will even know it's in there but
it will just balance out the tartness of
the sour cream the dill and the lemon
juice okay pinch of salt and pepper of
course
and that is the sauce how easy is that
this sauce kind of takes this dish from
busy weeknight to you could even
entertain with this people will be very
impressed that you've made a little
lemon dough cream sauce you'll never
know how easy it is
okay sauce is done let's go over and
cook up our salmon cakes okay y'all my
skillet has been heating up it's over
medium-high heat and i'm just going to
start forming my salmon into patties
it's really easy it's just to do this
with your hands
so i just take this
form it into however big you want to
make them
and
we'll get them right in the skillet
hear that sizzle that is exactly what
you want
i have about a tablespoon of oil in the
skillet and you do need to use oil in
this i mean typically i don't use a
whole lot of oil on a skillet if i'm
sauteing or something but for these just
to make sure they have a good crust and
they stay together
you need to use
enough oil
you can see after about two to three
minutes how quick these cook
look at that wonderful brown crust that
is exactly what you want
all right guys look how quick that came
together these are absolutely perfect
they might be the most perfect salmon
cakes i've ever made
pretty excited they just smell so good
and talk about quick and easy on a busy
week night i think this is what we're
all looking for quick easy healthy
inexpensive this is all of those things
oh and we can't forget how good it
tastes i'm gonna add a little bit of my
lemon dill sauce right over the top
look how good that looks if you wanted
to garnish it with some green onions or
some chives that would be perfect
definitely serve this to company and i
no doubt i'm serving this to my family
