welcome to pots pans and Pioneers today
I'm going to be making um mini chicken
pot pies so I've got three chicken
breasts here I'm going to cube them up
and I'm going to boil them in some um
water in a
saucepan so I'm just going to cube up
the chicken breast I'm going to do them
pretty small cuz these are going to be
mini they're going to be the Mini
version I'm going to put them into
muffin
tins and the smaller the chicken that
you know the faster it's going to cook
for
sure these are just this is just organic
chicken that's been uh freshly purchased
at the
store just going to cube that
up we're going to cook this on medium
high
for about 25
to 30 minutes now we have our sauce pan
that has the water I've covered it just
a little cover over the top of it and
I'm going to add my
seasonings so that it gets infused into
to the
chicken going to add about a teaspoon of
Sal
salt add a tablespoon of garlic
powder and you can add whatever
seasonings you you like in your chicken
flavors this is just what I do this is
black pepper
got some Cajun
seasoning some
thyme little bit of dehydrated
onion you could use fresh onion if you
wanted
to use a little a little bit of poultry
seasoning and I'm going to put a little
bit of
Rosemary and lastly some
parsley about a tablespoon
a vacuum SE some celery I don't have any
fresh celery on
hand so I'm going
to add a little bit of celery in there
this is frozen but it'll Tha as soon as
it starts
cooking okay let's get this on the stove
and we're going to cook this for about
25 to 30 minutes until the chicken is
cooked all the way through so we'll be
back okay we boiled our chicken and
their seasonings together and we have
probably a good amount of chicken broth
here which I'm going to freeze for a
later
recipe and I may use some of it in the
sauce that goes on the chicken pot pie
so I'm just going to
drain the chicken sorry for the view
try to stay out of the light do it from
this
side just going to drain the
chicken and my cubes of chicken are a
little large that's why I said we need
to make sure that they're chopped up
really small so I may run these through
the um food processor and get them a
little bit smaller to go down into the
cups and there this pot right here is
full of chicken seasonings that I'm
going to use in the base of the sauce
that I'm going to make so um let's go
over to the stove and get our sauce
going
for um our chicken pot
pies okay we're going to take our
saucepan that still has the seasonings
in the bottom of it and I'm going to
take 2 tablespoons of
butter and I get that melted down
I'm going to add a little bit of garlic
powder pinch of salt
you want to leave this uh on a medium
high or medium heat because you don't
want to burn your
butter just patiently wait it for it to
melt and then we're going to I've got a
scoop of allpurpose flour I'm just going
to shake in here
you can find the recipe on pots pans and
pin.com
so this is our this is like a
white rose start of our
cream cream of chicken if you already
have a can of cream of chicken you don't
need to make this particular sauce you
can just scoop the cream of chicken over
your vegetables
go
ahead that's a half a
cup there's another half a
cup of chicken broth put that stir in
[Music]
here as you can already tell in minutes
it's cream of
chicken I'm going to add a little bit
more chicken BX
[Music]
another half a
cup and you want the sauce to be really
thick because you when we pour this over
the vegetables and the chicken you don't
want your sauce to be really runny and
watery cuz it will um overtake the pie
crust and make everything really soggy
instead of
really beautiful
another great addition to this would be
a four of a cup of white wine and it
really brings out the flavors of the
chicken I'm going to pass on it this
time I have white wine but I don't
really want to cook with it tonight so
okay so you can tell this is really
really getting
thick now let's go assemble our chicken
pot pies
now we're just going to give our chicken
a little pulse with the food processor
just cuz I want
to make it a little bit more bite siiz
pieces and so I'm just going to pulse
this
until the chicken is
uh good enough
for bite-sized pieces oh
perfect out and these are just store
bought pie crust you can make your own
pie crust
absolutely um I'm going to use two pie
crusts I do have an extra one just in
case there's not
enough I'm going to use my extra large
um muffin tins to do these
mini chicken pot
pies okay
over
there okay so we're just going to use
the the larger size
um and I've got a
glass that has the same size as the tops
and I've got a biscuit cutter that's the
same size as the bottom of the
me so I'm going to cut the bottoms first
I've sprayed the pan with um some olive
oil and I'm going
to take the little bottoms and put them
in the bottom of
the the pans like
that oops
okay so we have our first layer
in and then I'm going to take and
scoop um chicken is the next
layer so let's get our chicken on
[Music]
chicken and then we're going to take our
mixed vegetable bows these are
previously frozen but they're organic we
going to put them on
tops just like that
and then another layer of
chicken okay
and three chicken breasts does almost
exactly the amount that we need for this
recipe get all the chicken that we can
okay then we're going to top it with our
sauce I'm just going to
drizzle over the top like that
sometimes you have to wait until the
sauce goes down into the muffin
tin and come back and ladle out a little
bit more
[Music]
[Music]
okay so now we're going to put our Tops
on going to start with
just the right size for the tops
just like
that for just about one more
okay the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to prick the top so that the
air is able to the hot air is able to
push through the bottom
okay take a little bit of soft
butter better the tops
and I'm just going
to poke some
holes now you could do a lattice top
with your pie crust if you wanted to
make it really
pretty all
right now we're going to B this at 375
for about 15 to 20
minutes and
um we'll see you when we come
back okay our chicken pot pies are out
of the oven and I've dished up one I've
also put a little bit of extra
vegetables on
top and I
will take another one out I've let this
cool for about 10 minutes
minutes so it's easier to scoop
out
oops now if you wanted really pretty
little chicken pot pies you could
absolutely you know set your crust on
the inside it just takes longer to bake
that
way okay you can get a copy of this
