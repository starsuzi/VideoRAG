hi my name is Jennifer and our project
today is pressure washing a driveway or
a sidewalk this can make a huge
difference in how your property looks
it's important to do this once maybe
twice a year anytime that you get algae
on any type of concrete that you have
outside this really helps take it off
and it also takes off any uh unwanted
and unnecessary
[Music]
dirt most of the time your pressure
washer will come with a list of
instructions the first step is to Simply
unscrew
the lid off the gas tank and slowly til
ITP forward to fill it
up next attach the garden
hose next attach the pressure
hose the pressure hose has little balls
inside and so when you pull back on it
this is how you'll attach it securely so
you'll pull back slip it over make sure
it's on securely and then
release then attach the gun to the
pressure hose
[Music]
turn on the water
supply squeeze the trigger to the gun to
purge air from the
pump and then water should start coming
out of the nozzle once all the air has
escaped and once we've purged all the
air we can then attach our
nozzle just hold until you have a nice
steady flow of
water the longer the hose the more air
you may possibly have
they're all different types of nozzles
that should come with your pressure
washer and as you can see here it'll
give a demonstration of the stream that
it will provide that that nozzle will
provide and The Wider the nozzle for
instance this one forms a really wide
angle on the Water The Wider the nozzle
the less powerful the stream will be
select the nozzle that you choose to use
for your job in this case I will use a
medium nozzle to do
concrete pointing the hose away from
you insert the
nozzle it's very important to make sure
it's on securely try to pull it to see
if it'll come off otherwise it may shoot
out at somebody or Ricochet off and hit
you when you start pressure washing set
your nozzle down and let's start the
engine the first step in starting the
engine is turning on the throttle most
pressure washers will have a throttle it
may look like this one or like something
else turn the throttle
on once we have the throttle on we'll
turn the gas on now it's time to start
our
engine this usually takes a little bit
of
force as soon as the engine starts turn
off the throttle
anytime you pull the trigger point the
nozzle away from you and others and be
careful that the nozzle does not
Ricochet and hit
you always wear safety goggles when
pressure washing debris and dirt can
easily fly up into your
eye typically you'll want to hold the
tip a few inches away from the
ground hold the pressure washer close to
the ground for tough stains or hold it
far away just for your regular
dirt be careful the closer you hold the
pressure washer to the ground it could
cause holes in the
concrete be careful not to hit the hose
of your pressure washer or your feet
this could cause damage to
either pressure washing can be very
messy it can ruin your clothes and spray
dirt all over your house your driveway
and yourself just be aware of this to
shut off the pressure washer turn off
the
engine turn off the water
supply then squeeze the trigger to the
gun to relieve system
