hi guys we're going to be making some
chicken spaghetti today and so I wanted
to bring you guys along and show you how
I make my chicken spaghetti so some of
the things that you would need you're
going to need a can of
rotail which is basically the diced
tomatoes and green chilies you're going
to need a can of cream of mushroom and
also a can of cream of
chicken some spaghetti and I have the uh
Skinner spaghetti IES the regular kind
you also need some cheese of course and
then right here I have chicken tenders
that I like to use to cook mine it it's
just a very very um good meat to use as
far as to prep to make the spaghetti
with or the chicken spaghetti so it's
about th throwing out so I'll come back
with you and let you guys see what else
I
do okay guys my meat is thn out and so
so you want to make sure that you clean
your chicken tenders make sure your
chicken or whatever you use some people
like to use chicken breast whatever you
use just make sure you clean it really
really well and so mine's cleaning so
what I'm doing now is I'm going to
gather them and lay them here so I can
put them in my pot so they can get ready
to boil and
cook all right so that's that now I have
moving them to the stove and I've
already started to have my water boiled
so I'm just going to go ahead and lay
these on in
here and kind of spread them
out I want to make ath it's okay so I'm
going to add just a little bit more
water to my pot cuz I want to make sure
that my meat is covered
have bar to go to the store and get
eggs okay what I like to
do is season my meat
while it's already in the pot and I'm
going to use my Tony sattin cuz that's
what we use down south and I'm going to
also use my duns allpurpose
seasoning this is really really good
guys so
go ahead and season my water and it's
looking like
that the D this season here is kind of
it's going to be
spicy so when my meat is done and
cooked the water or the r if that's what
you want to call it the chicken broth
cuz that's what it really is it'll be
kind of spicy and then I'm just going to
add my Tony satch
in and it's not going to be
salty cuz I know just about how much
seasoning to put in without watching
okay guys the chicken is done so as you
can
see it is
cooked and what I'm going to do is just
go ahead and take them
out and place them over
here let them cool off
so and they're just falling apart the
tender chicken tenders so anyway I'mma
set them over
here okay in the pot is the the actual
broth so you can see all the spices and
specs from the
chicken in the broth and so what I'm
going to do at this point is start to
add my
cheese and so on and so forth
okay so I'm just going to go ahead and
add my cheese
in to the
broth piece by
piece and start to let it melt
down and
occasionally um stirring it
up okay guys as you can see I already
started my um pot to boil for my noodles
to go in so it's good to put a little
bit of oil inside your pot so that when
your noodles are boiling they won't
stick together they're Flow Free and
just break break them up in half
basically just spread them
over okay guys as you can see my cheese
has already melted in so it's melted and
it looks yummy it's creamy and so now we
can go ahead and add in the rest of our
ingredi ingredients so let me just tell
you guys something the reason why I did
or I do mine this way I rather use the
chicken broth the natural chicken broth
that I boil my chicken in because it's
already seasoned and flavored as opposed
of melting cheese with regular water or
milk or however you choose to melt your
cheese and then having it done that way
this is just it gives it a whole
different taste if you use the the
natural broth so I'm just going to go
ahead and add in the cream of
mushroom then next I'm going to go ahead
and add in my cream of
chicken and
lastly I'm going to add add in one can
of the
Rotel and so this is what it looks like
and you just want to stir it all in and
mix it up very very
well and this is on a low heat because
you don't want your cheese to stick and
Scorch okay guys I wanted you to see my
chicken after it's cooled off what I do
is I strad it I pick it apart like this
because I personally don't like big
chunks of chicken in my chicken
spaghetti I kind of like it like
straighted chicken basically and then
also by me picking it apart with my
hands it allows me to pick any
unnecessary pieces of the chicken that I
do not want to eat or want anyone else
that's eating my food to eat like the
fat and gristle that may be on the um
very very little um chunks and my meat
is um seasoned so that's another another
good thing it's already flavored so I'm
going to go ahead and add this to the
mix and this will be the last step as
far as the mix preparation and once I
get it all added in then I'm going to
Stir It Up and make sure that it's well
Blended as you can see right here
they're pretty much done and you see
what I mean by adding oil to your
noodles or to the water so that they're
smooth and they do not stick together
so I'm just going to go ahead and
continue to mix this again it's still on
a low fire cuz I want to keep everything
hot once this is done okay guys my
noodles are done so what I'm going to do
at this point basically I pour a tad
bit into a pyate
pan and basically I like to just coat
the bottom part before I add my noodles
I'll go ahead and put my noodles on top
and add the rest of the
mix and just spread
it
again this is just my way how I like to
do it of course you guys do not have to
do it this way this is just my way of
how I like to prepare this
dish and so the noodles are done so I'm
just going to go ahead and go over here
to the sink and drain my
water so now I'm going to just toss them
right on
in okay and then I'm just Spread spread
them all
around and yes it has some water
retention but that's okay cuz it's all
going to blend in it's just a little bit
it's not that much
water so I spray spread it like this
spread it all
around and then
lastly I'm going to add the rest of my
mix the spaghetti
mix and just make sure is just spread it
all
over
M looks yummy and it's going to taste
yummy so some people like to spread
extra cheese on top shredded cheese or
what is it like the craft single slices
I don't do all that because it already
has enough cheese on here
so all that's left is to put this bad
boy in the oven and once it's done I'll
be back to show you guys the finished
product it's been in here for about
maybe 10 minutes so this is what it
looks like the finished
product and this is going to be very
very good my kids have been bugging me
they're hungry and they want to eat
so hope you guys have enjoyed my first
