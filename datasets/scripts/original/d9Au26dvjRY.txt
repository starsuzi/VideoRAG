what's going on rob here jack of all
tradesmaster none right now we're gonna
be moving the vinyl lettering from the
back of my window
yes yes yes more than likely i'm
shutting down my website
trap2323.com because
my youtube videos are
uh quadrupling what i'm getting off my
website i love youtube i love google so
what i'm gonna do is take this off right
here and this off right here and then
i'm gonna put a youtube
uh button right in here so uh what i'm
using for this is actually a
milwaukee heat gun but you only could
use it on low don't use it at a high
because what happens with windows if you
put it too hot you're going to start
bubbling your winch or your windshield
your window so all you got to do is get
hot enough for the vinyl the vinyl will
actually peel off easier than the heat
gun so let me get the heat gun on and
i'll show you how and you got to move it
around a lot don't leave it in one spot
move it around a lot move it around a
lot if you leave it in one spot you're
going to mess up the kind of glass in
that one area
it's hard to do with two hands so i'm
gonna do it one hand when i start
pulling the sticker i'll come back
[Music]
so
you got delicate hands wearing love
i actually don't get feeling
in my hands
when i was a young kid i used to work
for a company that used to make the acid
for rims on cars and i burnt a lot of
the nerves off inside my fingers
just a little bit of warmth
gets it all the way off
anyways that's how you go ahead and get
out the vinyl lettering like i said with
a razor blade and some uh invisi glass
i'm going to scrape all this outline and
then i got my new youtube one coming for
here
okay got all the vinyl lettering off and
then with a razor blade
i'm just scraping all the outlines of
the letter
after you scrape all the outline of the
letter you can wipe it off and there's
not going to show anything that existed
at all so right now i got the youtube
one coming in when the youtube one comes
in i'll show you how it goes on anyway
thanks for watching subscribe like and

after you can't even tell

coming in with the five days is gonna be
a big youtube one that i'm putting here
