hey guys so today I'm going to be
showing you a trick to putting
um the bits in your horse's mouth if
they're stubborn to that so
um let's do that
this is Cash the horse that we're going
to be working with today because he
doesn't like accepting the bits
um he's
just gained this habit
um so we're gonna be trying to break it
with
um a trick
so let me show you that
okay so obviously you're going to want
to do something with the halter what I
like to do is just
unbuckle
it
and flip it over his nose
so that we still have control
over him
um
then
what you're going to want to do is grab
your bridle
and
get the reins and slip them over the
head
and then you can unbuckle the halter
because then you have control over your
horse
with the Rings the same way that you
would have had with the halter
so
then what you're gonna do
is you're gonna act like you're putting
it on regular
with his nose through here
and then you have the bits
so I don't have a curb chain so it's
going to be a little bit different for
some people but not much so you're going
to lay your hand flat and
right here
and you're gonna have your thumb right
here and stick it in the corner of the
mouth
or sometimes they're being extra
stubborn you take your finger
and move it around up here
and see that makes them open their mouth
