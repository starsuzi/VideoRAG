hi my name is Jamie Hook and today I'm
going to show you how to fix your model
in chocolate disasters you know how
everyone says how easy it is to overwork
in modeling chocolate and how if you
stir too many times it's going to become
oily and greasy and you just can't
recover it after got to throw it away
waste chocolate whatever you actually
can fix it it's really easy all you need
is a wooden spoon and an empty
bowl so I'm starting with the basic
recipe of one PB white chocolate to half
a cup of corn syrup I've melted the
white chocolate in the microwave I
warmed up the corn syrup like everyone
tells you to and I'm just going to add
the two together and stir
so your regular recipes will tell you to
stir until it's just Incorporated that
the that the corn syrup is so that you
just don't see the streaks anymore and
it's just
right so I'm just mixing it just lightly
around the bowl you know not too
vigorously see all the streaks are
almost gone I'm going to give it two
more
stirs maybe three maybe four I don't
know until it's all gone
just kind of give it one more
here and this is a point where they tell
you to stop at this point what I'm going
to do is I'm going to take half of it
put it aside so we can do a comparison
later
on
okay butten it into a disc put it aside
forget about it
and then I'm going to take this other
remaining bit and I'm just going to Stir
It vigorously and stir it
until well I'm just doing what everybody
tells you not to do so the more I stir
it the more crumbly and disgusting it's
getting it's not really looking like
Marlin chocolate anymore it's kind of
looking like a greasy oily crumbly
mess I can take this and it's not really
coming together very much I'm going to
squeeze it all the oils are coming out
it's kind of nasty you really don't want
to work with this so what I'm going to
do now is I'm going to stop stiring and
I'm actually going to put it back into
the microwave for maybe 20 30
seconds so I've put this back into the
microwave now for about uh 32 second
blast you're going to find that
depending on the type of chocolate you
work the time of the microwaving is is
different um see all this nasty oil
stuff that's coming out this is what you
want to force out the more you work with
it the more oils that come out of it and
this is what's hindering your chocolate
from coming back together into the form
of Ming chocolate so I'm just going to
give it a few
stirs just to see if I can force even
more oil out of it the more you work it
at this point the more oily and gunky it
becomes it's almost like it's almost
like working with melted butter it's
actually pretty disgusting if if you
really think about it
but what we're trying to do is just get
all the solids back in while forcing all
of the oils to come out so at this point
what you may want to do is you might
want to strain it so I'm just going to
strain off some of the
oils just as much of it as I
can okay
[Music]
in just give it another couple
stirs and I'm just agitating it just
just kind of breaking it down a little
bit just forcing as much of the oil out
as possible and it's it takes work it
takes time it's not a pretty process
just going to strain it some
more
okay for add as much of it as
possible and this time I'm going to put
it into our clean
Bowl okay
so what we are doing now is we're
actually trying to mulfy the oils back
into the chocolate we're trying to work
it in a way where it pulls at the
structure of the chocolate and the oils
become combined into the Ming chocolate
again and the reason why I have a clean
wool is just because I don't want to
deal with all the leftover oils and crap
and crud in the other bow so all you
have to do is just keep pulling and
lifting see how nice and stretchy it
get so every time I do this I'm just
trying to get a little bit of height on
it just let the weight of the chocolate
do it otherwise you're going to end up
working your arms to
death and sometimes depending on how
oily it is depending on the type of
chocolate you use you might want to blot
uh today I'm going to try not to
l so you can see how it's become really
nice and stretchy when I lift it up it's
coming down in one long piece this is
the consistency that you're looking for
it's almost like pulling Taffy so you
can also see that the shine is kind of
gone a lot of the oils have gone back in
and it's a great consistency at which um
once it cures overnight it's going to be
great to work with so at this point I'm
just going to put it aside wrap it up
with syin wrap let it cure overnight and
we'll see how it goes
tomorrow so now we can compare the two
methods the regular method and the oh my
God I wrecked it now I'm trying to
recover it method um I've taped it just
so that we know which one's which and
what I'm going to do
now going to open up the
two and you can see that visually
they're fairly close um there isn't a
lot more oily shine on either one of
them the color is about the same and
it's not
until you actually start working with it
and you kind of realize that by forcing
it on all the
oils what you've done is you've actually
made the Molly chocolate A Little Bit
Stronger so I'm just going to
take this one is the one that we've
reworked
okay just going to knead that one this
is the
original recipe and you can see that it
kind of comes apart a little bit when
you first start kneading it you really
have to work it to bring it back
together um this one it came together
fairly
quickly okay just going to keep
kneading and eventually when I put them
side by side they're ver virtually
identical okay if I try spreading it out
you can see that they pulled just as
much as the other and they come back
together just as well so there you have
it how to ruin your modeling chocolate
and how to fix it right after that
