yeah so uh welcome back to the
blackstone name
channel
we're making today uh
x1 what are we making today oh today is
not ghanaian for you today
unfortunately i'd love to do that but
um
before my mom comes home i want to make
her something
by surprise so
i've decided to make a
haddock with tomato basil sauce
so we'll look at the ingredients first
here
okay so we got haddock fillets this is
about uh 300 grams
ideally you really really you want 500
grams or a bit larger
but you just you know
you do the measurements according to how
much fish you've got
it's up to you
got chopped tomatoes here
some sea salt
basil
some paprika hot
or you can just use normal paprika i've
got some oyster
mushrooms in two clove garlic
caster sugar or granulated sugar
and i've got some chopped onions here
which is half
half of an onion but you can use a full
onions up to you it just adds more
flavor
we're gonna come back when i'm sauteing
the onions mushroom that's what we're
gonna start with okay
peace we'll be back
okay i've got that i forgot to say that
we we start with the olive oil put olive
oil in the pan we heat up as it gets hot
we i've mixed the onions chopped up the
oyster mushrooms and i'm gonna add it to
saute
oh wow
we do this for about four minutes
or about two minutes
okay
we're gonna do this for about four
minutes
then we cover this
for six minutes then we're gonna come
back okay
peace okay this has been fired up in
about four minutes as i said before
after four minutes you're going to cover
it okay the reason why you're going to
cover it
is because you want to make
the mushroom tender okay so
do it like this for about six minutes
then afterwards we'll add these
fellow ingredients
now after six minutes of covering
let's see how it is
yeah starting to look crisp and tender
okay what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna
add
the
chopped tomatoes
okay just one can as needed
because it's got a lot of water you
don't really want to mix it so much
you just want to let the water evaporate
some some people boil the
the chopped tomatoes to get rid of the
excess water
so when you so when it goes into the
sauce you can just start mixing but if i
mix it now the water will mix with the
oil
and it won't be like it won't look like
an oil-based sauce it looks like a
watery sauce
spread out a little bit okay
i'm going to do is i'm going to add a
teaspoon of salt
okay
and add a teaspoon of paprika
it's a bit awkward
it's not a lot of paprika
you see if there's more paprika
no big deal
got enough
scrape around the bottom to get some
more out
okay add a
half a teaspoon of sugar
now when this happens
to save it from burning the bottom i'm
going to stir like this
okay diagonal
don't do this
just straight
like that
so you can see the oils on the side
okay
i've minced up the garlic so i'm going
to add this it's got excess water again
so i don't really want to stir it too
much so i'm going to put it around
do you like to do straight out
smell the diet
you don't like garlic
i love the garlic only bad thing about
garlic is it stays on your fingers
and we're gonna let this
fry for about
eight to ten minutes
let me make sure i've got everything
every
one minute or so
just gently slide this straight
so you can see the oils running in the
middle
you don't want it to be water-based you
don't want to mix it
and go crazy
also i'm up in that
i'm gonna put
half a teaspoon of dill because it's
good for the fish
okay
okay now very soon we're gonna add
the haddock
and when we do
we're going to put quite a lot of basil
okay
what's up cameraman x2 what do you think
of the snow so far
it smells good ass
oh mom enjoys it
i'm looking forward to the
the chicken in it
all right here we'll do some chicken now
some potatoes
the irish way spuds
some
spikes okay now before i put the haddock
in i'm gonna scatter some
basil and then when i put the haddock in
for garnish towards the end i'm gonna
put basil again
okay
i might add a tiny bit more dill
just a tiny bit
this is very good for the fish
okay
just stir it one more time
okay
let's put a teaspoon of
basil
i forgot where i put my other teaspoon
okay
now you might want to go a bit above a
teaspoon maybe one and a half
because you want to put quite a bit of
garlic i mean sorry basil
i smell the basil as soon as it comes in
the basil has a very strong
sort of a smell especially when you when
it's with a tomato
what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna nestle
the haddock fillets in with the sauce
for us
i don't want it too high so i'll put on
medium high
i've divided them into four you could
divide them into eight
and really i recommend you get more fish
really
and cut them into smaller pieces
but because this is just for my mom she
can enjoy the fish how she wants it
x1 let me just read this just read this
quickly
they are professional but yeah yes
there's a deal just meet me at the bus
stop
for my shopping bags
okay you might have to say to her
you know we're under
well we can't do it in it
well this is almost done so what what's
gonna happen is
you're gonna flip this over every like
four or so minutes or two minutes
so it's cooked on both sides
or if you really want to you can just
mix it
and we're going to leave that for about
10 about i'll say eight to ten minutes
so the flavor of the habit gets into it
and we'll come back
when this is finally done
okay before it will be done
like before the eight or ten minutes
that you use to cook this
i'm gonna add more bad basil to it
because remember it's tomato sauce
okay
so we'll come back
this is done okay so how many minutes
again
from eight to ten minutes you leave it
like this for eight to ten minutes or
ten minutes here and before you finish
you've got uh you garnish more basil
onto it okay so have a closer look
okay
it's been about
eight ten minutes okay
and the haddock is basically done has
been cooked it doesn't take long to cook
fish
okay put this a bit higher
before we finish
i'm just going to garnish some basil and
basically it's all done you serve it
with what you want to serve with beans
it might be rice
it's up to you did you say a teaspoon
teaspoon
yeah or right over yeah that will do
because you don't want to put too much
it's up to you
doesn't matter if the fish breaks up
it's not a big deal
and it's basically done
i'm going to switch this off
basically what you have
is haddock fillets
with tomato basil sauce also
let it rest and then drain the oil out
for serving
okay so uh
bon appetit oh hopefully my mom enjoys
this
peace
