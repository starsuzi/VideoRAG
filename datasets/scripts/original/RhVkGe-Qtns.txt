Offstring is a style of yoyoing that is aptly
named because the yoyo comes off the string.
With that you will be able to do many tricks
that you will not be able to do with any of
the other styles.
In our videos we will be using two yoyos:
the Big Yo, or the ReXtreme.
As you can see the two yoyos are very wide,
which makes them very easy to catch on the
string, so we recommend these for beginners.
If you just want to dip your toe in the water
and just try out offstring, the Big Yo is
less expensive, but if you know that you want
to get into offstring the ReXtreme will take
you as far as you want to go, so we ultimately
will recommend that.
As you can see, Offstring is a more entertaining
style than most of the styles, but what some
people donï¿½t know is that it is one of the
easier styles to learn.
So, check out the videos and before you know
it you will be able to do some impressive
tricks.
