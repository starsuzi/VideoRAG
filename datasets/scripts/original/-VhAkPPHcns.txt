hey there. this just quick video to show you 
how to make these paper briquettes or bricks  
for like burning in a rocket stove. that one 
right there is just made out of the shredded  
paper. you can also add in and make them 
with the weeds, grasses, leaves and twigs.  
so I'm going to make some out of that some 
out of the paper some out of a mix of both
alright, the first thing I'm 
going to do is add the water
about two cups. that should be about the amount 
we need. ok then add some of the shredded paper.
alright that will make one briquette basically  
what you just saw me add. 
let's blenderize it on low.
okay. that's it. now we'll strain it.
alright, to do the cans strainer just pull 
this out of here use this can and the bowl  
beneath it like that. throw some in 
there. okay like that. then all you  
do - take the other can smaller 
one with the bottom just put it  
in there will press out all the wate.r 
and just dump it. do this a few times.
that's it. now just put it in the Sun 
and let it dry. now I'm going to make  
some out of the leaves. use the two cups again.
and we'll use this.
and a whole bunch of grass
alright, that should be good
perfect
okay there it is
all paper, all twigs leaves and sticks and you 
can do like 50% paper 50% twigs leaves and sticks,  
whatever you want to do but either one works fine,  
just make sure they're really dry and then you 
can burn them in a rocket stove or wherever
there it is
here's a close-up on them. that's the 50/50 mix 
paper and weeds, that's solid paper, that's solid  
weeds and leaves. so I'll have years of fuel for 
these biscuits just using the weeds and leaves  
and twigs under under these bushes. again this 
is the whole press Denison's chili can, both  
ends cut out, Campbell Soup style can, one end cut 
out. just press it down pops right out the bottom
