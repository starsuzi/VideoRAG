hey everyone this is Stephanie Baker
with create kids Couture I'm going to
show you how to laminate your own fabric
today um I'm actually working on the
doll siiz Rowans so that's what I'm
going to um use this for but I have
right here the um can you see that
paleon vinyl fuse and um you just iron
this on to your fabric directly onto
your Fabric and there may be other
companies that make it this is just the
one that I found at Joann's so it's
style number 100r vinyl fuse fuse usable
um and the biggest thing with this is
that you just do not want to get it on
your iron so I've got my fabric laid out
I've already ironed it so it's nice and
smooth I'm going to take my vinyl fuse
and it's clear so I just need to remove
the backing sheet
which see if I can get it there we go
okay so I'm going to remove the backing
sheet I've got my iron on a medium
setting so you can
see it's a
clear piece and it's kind of sticky on
one side and then it's nice and smooth
and shiny on the other so I'm just going
to lay
it directly on my fabric where I want
it um and just kind of press and all the
instructions are actually on the back of
the vinyl fuse use um box so you can go
by that also and I'm going to use the
paper that was on there um there's kind
of a sticky side I'm going to put that
down and I'm going to put it directly on
top of my vinyl and make sure I'm
completely covering it because I do not
want that on my
iron and the iron like I said is on a
medium setting and I'm just going
to iron it
on press and hold in a few
spots my iron M need to be turned down
just to top it
sorry I'm just going to Iron Keep
iring it's right in the way sorry I'm
right-handed having trouble with the
video being right there and you just
move this paper as you
go you can kind of see
that it's shiny over here the fabric so
it's all been attached over
there that out of the
way
[Music]
back so can you tell that there's a
sheen on there now it's all attached to
our um fabric so now all I have to do is
cut out my pack pieces um and sew it
just like I would any other laminated
fabric any a cotton fabric so and
there's actual details in the pattern
for Rowan's raincoat um in Girl doll and
tween sizes um on tips and tricks for
sewing with laminate so that's it for
today I hope you enjoy thank you thanks
