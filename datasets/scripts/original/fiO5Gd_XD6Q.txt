hey folks Philly boy Jay back here with
another video and as you guys know New
Year's is right around the corner is
actually less than a week away and
Americans love to throw parties on New
Year's Eve to bring in the New Year's
with their family and friends and one of
the most commonly made foods during New
Year's are black ey peas Americans love
to cook black ey Peas on New Year's I
don't know if it's like some type of
tradition or something it was definitely
a tradition in my family my grandma made
black ey peas and pig feet every year
and so did my aunts my uncles and my
mother so I'm going to be showing you
guys how to make Black Eye Peas today I
also done a video on how to make pig
feet because Americans love to make pig
feet on New Year's as well those of them
who like pork obviously but I'm going to
be showing you guys today how to make
black ipas I have a bag of Goya black
ipas here and as you guys know black ey
peas stretch so even though it may look
like you're using a little bit once they
get done cooking it's going to turn into
a lot so I have a bag of gya black ipas
here
now this is a very important step this
is what you need to do for all of you
inexperienced cookers out there that
never made black IPS
before we have to remove these black IPS
one by one and that can be kind of time
consuming but it's really important
because you don't want to cook any stale
or rotten black IPS you have to remove
those black IPS so here I have have a
white paper plate I'm going to remove
the stale and rotten black IPS and I'm
going to place them on this plate throw
them away obviously and for the black
IPS that are in good shapee we're going
to add them to this big bowl of water
okay because we're going to allow the
black eyps to soak overnight some people
only allow them to soak for 8 hours if
time is not on your side and you have
the rush and you're making this at the
last minute rinsed them off really
really
well and soaked them for at least 2
hours um when you soak the black ey peas
it lessens the cooking time because
obviously with them soaking for a whole
24 hours overnight um they're going to
swell up so that's going to lessen the
cooking time okay so let's focus
guys a rotten black IP would be one that
looks sort of like
this see how it's split in half you
don't want any split black IPS or rotten
black
IPS I just kind of look through mine
like
this if I see any I remove
[Music]
them look at that it's kind of rotten so
we don't want that in there we don't
want to that so I'm going to remove
that I usually find about seven of
[Music]
them okay guys so this was our rotten
black IPS we're going to get rid of
these cuz these ones are
rotten so here is our big bowl of water
after you separate the rotten black eye
pce we're going to pour the black eye
pieas in this bowl of water
here and the way that I've been taught
to do it is to allow the black IPS to
sit and soak in this water overnight for
at least 24 hours you don't have to do
this some people just simply rinse the
black I peas but what this is going to
do is this going to shorten the cooking
time after we allow these to sit in this
bowl of water for about 24 hours or
overnight the black eyps are going to
rise to the top and they're going to
swell up okay so essentially what we're
doing is we're kind of cooking them a
little bit so they're going to swell up
and they're going to soak and then I'll
get back with you guys tomorrow when
we're ready to cook these delicious
black ey peas cuz I make the best black
ey peas in the whole wide world okay
folks see you
tomorrow
okay so that's the way you want your
onions and green peppers to
look
now this is what we're going to do I'm
going to use some old oil as you know
folks from down south love to save that
o because of the
flavor old oilu has
flavor in it so here's some old oil as
you can
see there's some crust from the fried
chicken left at the bottom of the bowl
going to use some of that old
oil so here's our sauteed green peppers
onions and minced
garlic what we're going to do now is
we're going to get our black ey peas
here's our black
ipas and as you can
see they're swollen they're thicker than
they were yesterday that's because
they've been soaking in this water
overnight
okay and they're floating to the top
because they're
lighter
okay so what we're going to do is we're
going to drain these black ey
peas going to drain these bad
[Applause]
[Applause]
boys okay guys so we have our pot here
what we're going to do is we're going to
add
two ham Hawks to the
pot you know what I'll add this little
small one here I add two and
A2 going to add the minced garlic the
salty onions and green
peppers we're going to add the chicken
broth
now and we're going to add add some
water we're going to add the black ey
[Applause]
peas and we're going to add the diced
tomatoes
now we're going to add the three bay
leaves these are my B
leaves okay so last but not least we're
going to add the season this step is
really
important we want to add
first are the chicken flavor bullion
cubes and this is the reason why I
don't add salt
to my black op PE because we're going to
be adding the bullion cubes and bullion
cubes have salt in
them and I'm going to start off with
about
three bullion
cubes my second bullion Cube I'm going
to add one
more the reason I'm only adding
three is
because you're going to get some salt
from that ham
Hawks and from the crei season that
we're going to be using
my personal
homemade crei
season and that's what we're going to be
adding
next here's my crei
season you guys have the recipe so if
you want to try this try it out think
you'll like
it here's one tablespoon
there two
tablespoons here's three
tablespoons
that's all I'm going to add at
[Music]
first and we're going to add a teaspoon
of garlic powder a teaspoon of onion
powder and a teaspoon of black
pepper it's a teaspoon of onion powder
[Applause]
teaspoon of garlic
powder and one teaspoon of black
pepper okay
okay and we're going to cover them with
this
top so that they get tender
faster and what you're going to do is
you're going to leave a little space on
the side so that it don't overbo
you cuz they will if you cover them all
the way up like
this okay you can do that once they
simmer all the way down but for now the
water and the beans are pretty high so
until it simmers down you're going to
leave a little space like that all right
to let the air out I'm cooking them on
low heat so it's going to take a little
while right so I get back with you guys
after 2 and 1/2 hours and we'll check on
them and see how they
doing
look at that
Guys these beans are
bumping they are the best black ey peas
you ever taste in your life
don't nobody
make black IPS like Philly boy J
nobody
black I peas Black I
peas m
mm- look at them delicious Black Op pees
look at
that my people from the South
so we like that
fat
and it may be a little loose for you
Southern folks out there I know y
Southern folks like it real
thick but if you let them sit for a
little while trust me they will thicken
up especially after putting them in the
refrigerator overnight
but there you have it folks black
IPS I hope y'all enjoy this
video and have a
happy
wonderful New
Year's
peace
for
