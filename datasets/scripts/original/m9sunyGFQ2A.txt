be painting this room different color
we've actually
installed 9in paper 1in tape along the
baseboards to help keep
anything off the carpet we're laying out
some drop clo and we've used duster
brushes just old paint brushes to
actually dust off the tops of the
baseboard and the tops of the door
jams before we start running our 1in
tape before
painting I I
um actually um
now installing our 1in tape along the
tops of the
baseboards we got the old color red on
the top of the baseboard you we want to
leave that exposed so our new color will
cover
getting our paint set up here we got two
gallons of paint this room we've boxed
both gallons of paint into a five make
sure the color is consistent it's a dark
green color we going over this dark
brown and
red the carpets are going to be replaced
in this room but we got drop cloth in 9
in paper just down just in case customer
eventually in a week decided they
weren't going to replace the carpets
we're protecting it anyways and now
everything's taped off masked ready to
go we're going to start our ceiling cut
ends first and get the first coat a
light skim coat on the walls that will
dry quickly be rolling it it's a small
room so I'll be rolling it with a 9in
nap and extension pole we also like to
run a strip of 9 9 in paper and tape
across the window sills so if there's
any drips or splatters doesn't land on
the window
sill we're doing our high cut ends
first otherwise if you roll the walls
first and you're leaning your ladder on
your painted wall so get your high cut
ends done first with a ladder and then
start rolling your first coat getting
set up to roll our first coat
now we're going to do all of our
cuttings around our door jams and
windows prior to our first and second
coat on the walls too that way you don't
get any haloing around your door jams
Windows starting to install our first
skim
coat on the walls too
doing
our first skim
coat not worried about 100% coverage you
want to do a very light coat that'll dry
quickly we're painting just one room
today in this house so you want it to be
thin and dry very fast so you can get
your second coat on Within in about 30
minutes we're turn we turn the heat up
to about 70Â° to get it to dry faster
also we've used
Crawford's interior spackle for any
holes in the walls we spackled them
first and then while rolling there's a
possibility you'll see doing your first
skim coat you may see some holes and
then you'll just spackle those holes too
you want to make sure any spackling is
done prior to your first skim coat or
after your second skim coat you do not
want to have to spackle anything on your
final coat cuz it could show a touchup
Mark or flashing
spot
now I've got all of our cuttings done
the first coat is dry about 30 minutes
later and we're rolling our second coat
and once the second coat is rolled we're
going to pull off all of our masking and
while doing our cutting c ends we
actually used cocking the tape and
then did our cut
ends just about got this room
completed got two coats it's tooken
approximately about 1 hour to get this
entire
room completed cut ends two coats on the
walls and all cleaned up just making our
final touchup kit leave to the
customer and here where we're rolling
this wall our cut ends were moving quick
enough that our cut ends aren't drying
so we could pull off our tape and
masking after the second
coat is
dry
it's about a 14 by 13 Ved ceiling room
completed in 1 hour this is Chris the
