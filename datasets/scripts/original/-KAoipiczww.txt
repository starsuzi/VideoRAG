hello today we are going to learn how to
make vegan milk
so we're going to use a type of nut
so let's see the ingredients and the way
to do it
so for the cashew milk
that i'm going to do this is how we're
going to do it
i'm using
cashew nuts it's a type of nut
brazilian nuts
a large size
it's very very nutritious has a lot of
nutritional value
it's very very similar to the regular
milk
we can use these nuts or we can use
another ones like walnuts these ones
here
so for
so for the walnuts make sure it's peeled
all we do is soak it in
water for about an hour and then peel it
quickly with your hands it comes right
off
and then follow the same steps that i
will do with the cashew
so that's any type of milk you can
change the type of nuts and it would get
the same results
so for this one it's two thirds of a cup
of cashews if you're looking for the
weight it's about 160 grams
so first we are going to soak it in
water for about eight hours or 12 12
hours or 8.
i've already soaked these ones for 12
hours
and these are other ones that i'm
soaking
so let's make sure it's covered with
water
and then while we're blending we're
going to add three cups of water this is
two cups i'm still going to add another
one
and we're also going to add syrup for
some sweetness so it's a little bit
thick as well
so any type of syrup is good this is the
one i'm going to use
if you can't find syrup further you
don't have any you could also use honey
same purpose it's it's the same thing
so here i have my strainer i have four
layers of gauze
a strainer
and my bowl so this is so smooth and to
make sure everything is is just straight
milk
okay and this is the bottle that i'm
going to use to store it in the fridge
and it doesn't take any
it doesn't take very long to do
and it lasts about four days in the
fridge for you
so now let's see how we're going to
blend the ingredients
so here i've
strained the cashews from the water
they've been strained and then i'm going
to add them into my blender
and i'm going to put two teaspoons of
syrup
very small not a lot as you can see
that's good
and then i'm going to add some water
just a little bit to start make sure you
cover the all the cashews
that's all for now we're going to add
the rest later
and then i'm going to start blending it
on high speed
like this
i didn't add all the water at once
because if i added all the water at once
it's not going to blend properly and i'm
going to have pieces floating
so make sure you add just a little bit
of water first make sure it's
well blended and you can continue to add
the three cups
so as you can see here i feel like this
is good enough and then i continue
adding the water
while it's blending i'm going to add the
water so i'm going to start the blender
again
and then i'm going to add the water
like that
and we're trying to get it into a smooth
consistency
make sure everything is blended there's
no pieces floating or anything
there we go so nothing is floating it's
you can tell that it's well blended and
the top is very smooth
so now i'm going to start straining it
some people don't like straining it they
like the thickness
but i'm going to strain it to show you
how if you wish
okay as you can see
i'm going to start straining it
so i'm pouring it into my strainer now
and then i'm going to squeeze the rest
out like that
and see how very very smooth and liquidy
it is i've strained everything out there
wasn't much in it but it's all
it's actually like regular milk
as you can see this is how much it makes
it's about three three cups of water
and two thirds cashews
you can store it in the fridge you could
stay about three or four days
and make sure every time you use it you
shake it well because it sets a little
bit
and you can add more
syrup to it when you're drinking if you
want a little bit sweet
or honey or sugar whatever you want
and this for this milk i can also use it
to make um
cashews sorry mozzarella
cheese
because it's vegan so i could use it for
vegan cheese
and it doesn't have a strong taste so it
could be used to make
different cheese
so hopefully you can try this and enjoy
thank you bye
