hey smudge what you doing
oh is your treat bone empty
well what you gonna do about it
well you can't have those have you read
the ingredients
it's got sugar and five products
coloring and chemical preservatives
hey i've got a great idea we'll go make
something healthy for your red bone
come on
now there are a lot of things out there
that are labeled dog treats and dog food
that just aren't good for dogs
and smudge is older and she's got
arthritis
from what i've read grains and potatoes
are bad for arthritis
grains cause inflammation in dogs and
the inflammation
feeds arthritis and cancer too so i make
these totally grain free
no sugar either i start with one cup of
natural peanut butter
you know the kind that doesn't have salt
or sugars or anything
it also has all that oil at the top
which is just a peanut oil that has
accumulated after it's settled just stir
it up for a few minutes it'll all get
mixed well
there we go now put a cup of this into
the bowl of your mixer
in a separate bowl let's mix up the dry
ingredients garbanzo bean flour and
tapioca flour are gluten free so they
don't cause that inflammation we were
talking about
from here on out there are no absolutes
in this recipe you just have to watch
and add as you go you'll see what i mean
mix the peanut butter on low speed with
a little bit of water maybe about a
fourth of a cup
until it's smooth add in about a third
of your dry ingredients
and then you'll start slowly adding in a
little bit more water
add your second installment of dry
ingredients
then a little bit more water and go easy
on the water
this is where you can start putting too
much water in and then it gets sticky
add your final installment of dry
ingredients
and let's see how we've done
it's still dry so we'll add just a
little bit more water maybe a tablespoon
at a time
turn the speed up a little bit and let's
see if it's moist enough
it should start to pull away from the
bowl and leave the bowl fairly clean
with the garbanzo bean flour and
moisture in the air
you just can't be sure how much water
you're going to need so you just have to
go slow
let it spin a little bit and watch it it
should be moist but not sticky
once you've reached this consistency
just turn the speed up to about medium
and let it run for a few minutes it
needs to beat up a little and toughen up
once the bottom is clean and mostly the
sides then pull it up and let's feel of
it
it shouldn't be sticky or stick to your
hands at all should be easy to roll
there that's nice put it into a clean
container and cover it tightly with
plastic wrap
let it sit for about 15 minutes in the
meantime set up a rolling station
and also a sheet pan covered with
parchment don't forget to preheat your
oven to 350.
now you can make it into any shape that
you like
you can roll it out and use a cookie
cutter shaped like a bone
remember it's only cute for you the dog
really doesn't care
they are pretty cute though
or you can just use a pizza cutter or a
knife and make little squares
just be sure to cut your little rolling
mat
but for me and smudge it's play-doh time
she loves that little treat bone so i
roll it out into a snake
and cut it into little pieces that will
fit the red bone
place them on the parchment and then
bake them at 350 for about
30 minutes check them and if they're not
crunchy yet
put them back in for another 10. once
they've cooled i put them in my food
dehydrator for a few hours just to make
sure there's no moisture left in them
i don't want them to mold
if you don't have one of these that's
okay just leave them in the oven
turn the temperature down to 200 degrees
and let them sit for an hour or two
after they've cooled i leave them in an
airtight container until she's ready for
a snack
your dog is a member of your family so
feed it like a member of your family
don't just take the front of the box for
granted read the ingredients
or better yet make your own
see you next time on kimberly in the
kitchen
