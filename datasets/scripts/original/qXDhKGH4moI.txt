and physics prints jelly you would say
done this is my ultimate healthy food
breakfast lunch and dinner first up is
my breakfast Bircher muesli Bircher
muesli traditionally gets made the night
before and left in the fridge I find
that a little bit too heavy and slightly
stodgy so it's the same principles but a
lot lighter first in the yogurt I think
live and raw milk yogurt are best
they're packed with calcium enzymes and
probiotics which help your body absorb
nutrients is interesting because the
kids especially prefer their measly with
milk by the yogurt it's so much better
for I like making it literally ten
minutes before I want to serve it
because it doesn't become stodgy yogurt
in apple juice as a great way sweetening
and usually a couple of tablespoons in
give that little mix now sprinkle in the
oats I like putting 2/3 in now to absorb
an almost double in size and the last
third of oats in at the end
oats are low on the glycemic index which
means they slowly release energy to keep
you going right through to lunch I quite
like it when it just falls off the spoon
you can see literally in seconds
it's got thicker the rest of the oats in
so I've got different textures
now mix that up nicely and it literally
takes three or four minutes to put
together
it's go time pan on almonds incredibly
healthy toasting them even better flavor
flake them into the pan lightly toast
them that gives a really nice sort of
crunch to the top of the music rolling
around the pan so they're evenly toasted
out into a bowl the exciting thing about
putting your own music together is that
you're in control blackberries summer
raspberries strawberries
and so it changes Bowie's don't just
taste great
they're packed with antioxidants and
vitamin C and K so just dot the top of
your muesli with your blackberries
generous on the blackberries sweetness
tartness acidic and then just scribble
over your nice almonds I quite like a
lot of crunch on top ah so be generous
that looks fantastic
perfect way to start the day
my quick Bircher muesli doesn't just
taste incredible it makes you feel
fantastic is my ultimate healthy
breakfast there really is no better way
to start the day
