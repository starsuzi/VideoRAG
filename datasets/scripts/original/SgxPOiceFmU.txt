necessary s Cuts with a felt tip pen
sheets should overhang the roof by 60 mm
to allow rainfall to run off into the
gutter and should be wide enough to
cover the barge board at the
side if cutting is required use an angle
grinder with a metal slitting blade

a good tip when cutting is to sandwich
the sheet between other sheets with the

protruding if a sheet has to be cut to a
finished width make the cut in the slope

sheet avoid Drilling and cutting sheets
in very cold weather warm sheets will be
less prone to
damage step three drilling

drill sheets singly with a masonry bit
using a low-speed drill and light
pressure support the sheet securely
under each hole position when
drilling please note holes for fixings
must be drill larger than the fixing to
allow for expansion typically 10 mm for
a 3 m
sheet there should be at least five
fixings per support across the width of
the
sheet step four
