everybody truck rider 72 here
today I'm going to
Franklin Cascadia
one is floating the gears shifting
without using
why do we do that
I'm lazy
hey everybody just wanted to take a
minute to explain how to upshift while
you're floating the gears watching the
clips I realized I did not explain
anything while I was up shifting so I
want to do that now real quick when
you're starting out or want dub shift
you're having foot on the gas
accelerating truck is in we're in this
case right now second gear as you get
the speed up about 1500 rpms at the same
time you want to take your foot off the
gas pop it out of gear wait for pause
and while it's a neutral band be half
second to a second put it in the next
gear then step on the gas and do that
for all the gears as you're up shifting
step or release the gas pop it out move
it over put in the next gear the next
segment of video will show you how
that's done thanks
