[Music]
welcome to another episode of simply
sarah today on the show we're going to
be making a drunk soup that you get like
at the chinese restaurants
and in a kettle i have got 10 cups of
chicken
broth or stock whatever you want to use
up
to a bowling and i added a tablespoon of
dried chives a tablespoon of parsley
flakes
and now we're going to salt and pepper
it
to taste
now if you don't like to see the black
flakes of pepper in your soup you can
use the white pepper and you won't be
able to see them
my chicken broth
was hadn't had no salt in it so
now
i
left a cup of
chicken broth out
i'm gonna add
four tablespoons of cornstarch
and
we're just going to whisk this
make sure you get all your lumps out
okay
now we're just going to dump this
right in
and this is going to be our thickener
so give it a couple minutes and it'll
start thickening getting thick
and then we'll go on to the next step
okay our soup is getting thick
now this time is the egg part of it i've
got eight eggs in here and i'm beating
them
and then what you're going to do
is
slowly
do a string
this makes your little
noodles
all right
and then
let's give them a little tiny stir
you don't want to break up your little
egg threads let them finish cooking for
about another minute
or two and then i'm gonna light them up
and serve it
as long as your liquid is boiling real
good your chicken broth
is it table your noodles don't take as
long
okay it's done so we can turn it off now
and let's ladle this about a bowl up
now if you want yours a little bit more
thicker you can add a little bit more
cornstarch
and you can see the pieces of parsley in
chives that's up to you that's optional
you don't have to put that in some
people don't put that in and there's
sprinkles on the top or you do a little
bit of green onions or scallions
it's nice and hot but i want to take
them out
so good
i always crave this when i get down sick
instead of chicken noodle soup
because i like the noodles
just i just want the noodles and broth
don't want no chicken
a drop soup
today in the show we're going to be
making my version of egg rolls
okay
for my feeling for my egg rolls
um
i had some chicken stir fry left over
and every time i have little bits of
chicken and vegetables and stuff i keep
that into a baggie in the freezer i'm
gonna have it full
it's time to make egg rolls i also
sauteed some
a little small head of cabbage up
and this is
the veggies it's in my stir fry we've
got sugar snap peas snow peas i have
some chicken
i have carrots i have broccoli
i have onions
i have water chestnuts
uh grated ginger grated garlic
[Music]
little pieces of roasted
red bell pepper
you can put any kind of filling you want
to in egg rolls
[Music]
so now we're going to take a girl
wrapper
[Music]
it's a square
that's how they come
you put it
like a triangle in facing you
[Music]
and then you're going to put in
about
two tablespoons
of filling you don't want to feel them
too full
and then you're going to take your
little triangle that's closest to you
over
the ceiling and tuck it under
and then you're going to fold in your
ends
and then you're going to roll
and then you're going to take some water
or your fingertips
and moisten the other triangle
and that is your
seam you're going to keep on rolling
so
let me show you again you want to make
sure your surf is completely dry
for the water or your egg rolls will
stick
here's another egg wrapper
triangle to you
a couple
tablespoons
of feeling
closest to the end of the triangle
you're going to take your
your triangle
closest to you
put it in you know fold it up under the
meat
filling
fold in your
ends
kind of like you're wrapping a package a
little bit
roll again
and then you got your little triangle
left at the end
and this is going to be your thing
you're sealed up
and i'm going to keep doing that until i
run out of wrappers and filling
and i just got them on a cookie sheet
you can dust your cookie sheet
with a little bit of oil or a little bit
of cornstarch to keep it from sticking
um
mine ain't sticking so
i'm not gonna do that
and then we're gonna go back
after i got them all rolled and then
we're gonna deep fry okay we get ready
for our egg rolls and
i had lots of egg rolls so i put like
some sugar wrap or wax paper or
something between the layers so they
won't stick
i've got some wool heating up and this
happened to be canola
hit it up to about 350 degrees
and you're going to take your egg roll
let me show you also
to make if you don't have a thermometer
to see if your oil's ready to go
put your wooden spoon the end of the
wooden spoon into
into a pot if it starts bubbling around
the window spoon
then it's ready it's hot enough
put your egg roll
here
and i'm only probably about five three
at a time
just drop them in easy
these don't take very long to cook
because you know the filling's already
done you're just
crisping up
the outside
for about two to four minutes
make sure you turn them
you just want to keep them to the golden
brown
all
around
about another minute
and i'm ready to pull these up
okay these are nice and golden brown and
i've got a plate here with some
newspaper i saved my newspaper and then
i put a
i put a few sheets of newspaper down and
put a paper towel down
and then
that's what i used to drain stuff that
have deep fried and stuff
you can also clean your windows with
your newspaper too
and you just continue to you got them
all fried
okay here's a little i had some
uh egg roll wrappers form leftover after
i ran over feeling
and you know the little crispy noodles
that you get at the chinese restaurant
to put on your soup i know my chinese
restaurant has it i don't know if yours
does well i just cut
my
egg rolls up into little strips
and this is gonna be your crunchy noodle
so i'm gonna show you you can either
make some crunchy noodles go with your
soup
or some eat it with just crackers
and you're just going to throw me in the
oil
and these don't take very long
[Applause]
let me get me a little
i have one of these little spider net
things
for this
you just want to get them good and
crispy them don't take bread a minute or
two now we're just going to bring them
up
strain off it and put them on a little
paper towel to let them finish drying
i have another couple bowls of soup here
and then we're just going to
lay a couple noodles
into the bowl
and these are your little crunchy
noodles like you get at the restaurant
so there's a little quick tip for your
hey drop soup
finish with egg rolls another batch goes
down
and after i get all these down
and get them all deep fried
i'm gonna show you how to make a little
dipping sauce so i'll come back when
everything's done okay now we're gonna
make two different dipping sauces for
our egg rolls
put our stove back on i got a little
sauce pot here and i've got started with
1 4 cup of pineapple juice
and then we're gonna put some ketchup in
about two tablespoons of ketchup
[Music]
about a tablespoon of soy sauce
that looks like a tablespoon
and then you're going to put in
[Music]
a third of a cup of rice
vinegar
and then you're going to put in four
tablespoons
of some brown sugar
and we're just going to
mix this all together
get all your sugar dissolved
if you want yours a little bit thinking
you sprinkle in
a little bit of corn starch
you're not cooking this you're just
heating it up
enough that the brown sugar
dissolves
and you can use white sugar if you don't
have brown sugar
so there's
dip number one
okay
dipping sauce number two
we're gonna take some soy sauce
into the back
and then you're gonna take some sesame
oil
and you're gonna put a couple splashes
of that in
and then you're going to take
a little pinch of some sesame seeds i
might happen to have black sesame seeds
on hand
a couple pinches
and
a splash
of
rice vinegar
and there you have you can sell some
recipe
okay now let's try one hopefully these
are cool
evenings
one
very good
that's your standard usually
and uh sweet and sour sauce
is what the americans
came up with
it's not actually
chinese actually like both
so whatever you choose
i'm going to serve yours or you can just
serve it just
place the whistles
