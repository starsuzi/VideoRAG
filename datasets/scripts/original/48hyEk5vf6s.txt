hello and welcome today we're gonna fix
no we're gonna cook this fish
today we are showing you how to prepare the
salmon this marinated salmon just mix
sugar and sea salt and a bit of thyme
and in a ball then put a bit of lemon
juice on the fish put the salt on top
yeah it's pretty simple it's really
simple actually but this will turn the
meat into something delicious that you
normally buy from the supermarket but
you can make it yourself like this once
you cover the whole meat with the sugar and salt mix
cover it in plastic foil
place the salmon in a tray whatever you have and then
put something on top of it so it keeps the meat pressed
and then
place it in the fridge for one or two
days the meat will cure and will taste
delicious
once it's ready it looks something like
this you remove the plastic foil and
it's ready to cut and enjoy just cut it
with your sharpest biggest knife that you have
this is not a perfect knife but
it works for us the most important part
here is the taste these really tastes delicious
and it's just like the Salmon
you buy in the supermarket that is
really finely finely sliced and it's
very expensive but this one is cheap and
you can easily do it yourself it doesn't
take a long time and it's something nice
to try
this salmon you can eat it as it is
or you can roll it like this it depends
on how you prefer it and if you want to
arrange it nicer you can even put some
lemon and put it between the fish
now we come to the best part you put some cheese
Philadelphia cheese or any other
cheese you prefer or butter and enjoy it
