Kyah what are you looking for my slime I
just can't find it
run oh what's that
it's a toy oh yeah yes slime okay Hey
I assure you how to make slime you
barely know how to make cookies Nana oh
ha ha you got jokes now han kya just
kidding ha ha funny
whatever okay come on down let's go make
some slime hi everyone it's Akaya
and her Nana doing cool science tricks
so today we are going to kaya making
slime okay so but before we do this kids
remember always always ask your parents
for permission and so okay I tell the
folks what do we need
Oh we need water how much half cup half
cup of blue half cup of liquid starch
good coloring litter what's been
Bachelor plastic baggie and kibble okay
and before we start this experiment we
want you to hypothesize why do you think
when we mix water liquid starch and glue
why does that make slime hmm
think about that okay so are you ready
to do this yes okay all right well let's
move this stuff out of the way here
because we already have things ready to
go okay here we go all right
so kya let's do this
okay so first we're going to pour in the
water yeah
let's do that mm-hmm okay we're going to
pour in the glue okay
[Music]
make sure you hit that out that looks
that's okay
didn't know good
yeah that's good okay go flip that over
to the side here okay go ahead and stir
that up and make sure that you start
really really good right Akaya
mm-hmm okay not just okay look how's it
feel pretty goopy
okay all right can I like okay all right
so what do we do next okay what's next
big coloring group color onion okay we
want to give it some color
okay about how many drops or four should
be good oh that was great more remorse
okay here you do that Akaya and I'll get
the glitter ready
oh really doing a little bit more okay
okay here you can put the glitter and
you get me you can never oh wow
okay and then we use too much okay you
didn't get all right hmm let's see what
does that look like
how much you add some more
okay all right okay all right keep going
no no no sorry nope all right stir that
up Kai okay and let me try to get some
of this off and now what is next and
this is the fun part what are we going
to put in mix the tire would start the
liquid charge okay and tur that Akaya oh
what's happening
turning to a slime pit is it's starting
to get a little thick isn't it all right
because glue is a polymer and so when I
kind of put that glue in it mixed with a
liquid starch and so the polymer absorbs
the water in that mixture and it became
one large molecule okay keep stirring
that up and you can also find polymers
and diapers that's why it absorbs you
know the liquid that's in the diaper
well okay how are we doing Kai oh good
put that up there and so what a chi
enjoy she's going to stir that and
stirred until a lot of the liquid is
gone absorbed okay
what do you think are we ready to
transfer that to this bowl here okay so
let's go ahead and do that
okay you know okay what are we going to
do now we are going to push it with our
mm-hmm I do remember why we're using our
hands to do that have something to do
with the liquids and Ted it's a little
bit more that liquid yeah he's out of it
okay so why don't you mean me so why
don't you hold that up so we can see
what it looks like a fan look like slime
I think it does okay can I see that okay
yeah okay it says so now I'm going to
talk about slime here and the science in
it
so slime is a non-newtonian fluid and
what that means is it's not a true
liquid nor is it a true solid that's
because you can pick it up like a solid
but watch what happens it looks like a
liquid again so that's why it's a
non-newtonian fluid okay and there you
have your July so Akaya
do you know any fun facts about slime
where sine was invented in 1976 and was
sold in a little green Cash Cab so in
1973 so you know what in 1976 I was
eight and you're eight Wow and you know
what I remember that little green trash
can but in 1976 guess what your Poppa
was 16 he was so
you cut a hold we hope you had as much
fun as we did
don't you have a partner tyre yes and if
you did and you would like to see more

until then kids stay cool kids Richmond
stars always believe in yourself to
never stop questioning last time from if
I don't get it out are you twenty bucks
okay alright here we go why do our you
leave comments well I can turn in front
what is wrong with me really well we
hope you
like more experiment right over time
coming
