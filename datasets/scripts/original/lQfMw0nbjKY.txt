everyone has their own way of making
Yorkshire puddings this is mine
four eggs into this joke these four eggs
measured 200ml so into this jug add
200ml of milk and into here 200 milk of
flour pinch of salt and when those are
nicely whisk add the flour by sitting in
just a bit at a time
[Music]
fed this now needs to be left to rest
for about 30 minutes if you can leave it
for a couple of hours even better while
I hope your pudding batters resting
we're going to get the tin ready and
into here I'm going to add some fat now
you can use large dripping vegetable oil
I'm actually going to use a little bit
of goose fat today and then you need to
heat your oven as hot as it will go
practically around about 230 degrees
Celsius okay now I need my tent ever so
slightly smoky
[Music]
there we are this now goes back into the
oven about 15 to 20 minutes until these
Yorkshire puddings are lovely and risen
and golden round perfect
