quick and then you just need a bowl to
put them in as I have
here and a knife no uh no sizes really
in particular just one that's easy to
handle the first thing you're going to

here you can make two stacks of tomatoes
of the slices and then you just keep
them on their side and make two cuts per
stack then you make a quarter turn
one two again that finishes your first
half then you take your second stack do
the same thing one
two quarter turn
again
one
two and your finished product looks like
