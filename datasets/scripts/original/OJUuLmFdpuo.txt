so we've gone through all of our tools
we've shown you how to mix your muds now
before this dries let's go fill some
gaps before we get started taping we
want to fill our gaps now this is my
45-minute mud it's not silky smooth it's
a little thick and I don't need one of
those little pans to hold on to it Hawks
are awesome you can have more mud and
it's a lot easier to carry like this
then it is like this you'll get nasty
cramps so basically what we're doing is
we're just going to slap some mud up
here and by the seil Gap
okay this is just the more you can put
up here the
better this is not about being pretty
this is about being quick you don't have
a lot of time here so put our knife here
we're going to hold on in a bit of an
angle about
22Â° okay we're going to fill up that Gap
relatively speaking real quick and
simple if it's not filled come from the
top use the side of the knife to press
it in and then do the same thing
there all right okay
so really what we're doing is just
trying to fill the Gap with this
mud so that we can
tape this mud should be stiff enough to
hold itself in
place and this is just a little
something so that when we're taping
we're not
relying on our wet compound to hold all
up in place look at that e unbelievable
so if you don't succeed the first time
try try again just keep on going back
fill in the bottom fill in the top until
you get it nice and full like that
that'll be good enough for
us so usually you don't have a gap on
the ceiling cuz you put the ceiling in
first but if you remember earlier we had
spray foam on this wall and the client
wanted it covered because they were
concerned about the fumes from fire
damage that'd be the perfect storm but
you know we we reluctantly agreed to
cover the walls and now I'm faced with
doing this mess but this is effective it
does dry quick and if I don't do this
I'm in for one heck of a mess when I'm
doing my tape
joints I still fill in the gaps I got to
move
quickly the trick with this stuff is
work from the side of the knife don't
put the mud in this
way come off the side of the knife it's
easier way to put mud on the wall and
leave it there then clean it this
way okay
put that in nice
[Music]
and
okay there we go now we don't want any
mud in this corner that shouldn't be
there make sure you take time to clean
it now that's ready to tape this Gap is
about a/ an inch it's pretty
severe if you're fine and you have
trouble with that sort of thing
happening
take it
out and grab some mesh tape now the
fiberglass mesh tape is something that
you should have on you when you're
working it's a great little piece of
tape to have in your
toolbox it gives you a lot of
flexibility to solve problems like this
so generally speaking I like to use
paper tape only I will keep fiberglass
tape on hand for just such an occasion
as this like to
pre-measure rip it off with the edge of
your knife it's got an adhesive on one
side
so what I want to
do is put it up here and bridge the
gap all
right and I want to slowly just work
that into the
corner without cutting
it nice and
easy now fiberglass tape the unique
property you can use that to fill the
Gap and this will help hold the mud okay
you cannot use rag in the mud with
fiberglass mesh tape it won't hold for
whatever reason I'm not a
chemist oh I only know was from
experience fiberglass mesh tape does not
stick ball to
mud and it will peel off if you don't
use mud with a
hardener now that we have that up
there back to the same process
off the side of the
knife remember speed is very important
here cuz this is already starting to set
up pretty
[Music]
quick take all the excess
out again clean the bottom a little bit
you don't want mud there you don't
need and with some
pressure so if you have some
time work the joint just a little bit
get all the extra mud out get rid of the
wrinkles and if anything is you don't
like it just push it up in the ceiling
so it's out of the way and it'll be
covered by the next
coat here we
go ready to
tape if you're enjoying these videos
