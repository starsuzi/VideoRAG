this strand is now about 2 feet longer
than the outside strand so I'm going to
use this opportunity to shorten this one
to make it more equal so I'm going to go
ahead and use the
vertical Larks head
now these two strands are almost the
same
length I like how this is naturally
bowing out so I'm going to just do a few
more Lars heads just to accent
that and now when I join that one up
it'll have a little half circle it's
kind of
