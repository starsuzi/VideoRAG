hey guys thanks for stopping by
Ballistic Barbecue today on this video
what I'm going to be preparing is brazed
beef short ribs on the Dutch oven um
haven't done a dutch oven cook yet I
don't think on video uh really looking
forward to doing this um before we get
started though I'd like to go over the
ingredients all right the first
ingredient is going to be the beef short
ribs I Got 5 lbs here cut across the
bone as you can see it's nice marbled
meat and uh a good 2 in
thick got here one large pretty roughly
minced white sweet
onion two carrots thinly
sliced and two U ribs of celery also
thinly
sliced two sprigs of Rosemary four
sprigs of thyme tied together with
twine two dried bay leaves you can also
use fresh if you have
them I'm using 2 tbsp of Mexican
oregano and three cloves of garlic that
I've uh minced up 1 6 oz can of tomato
paste 2 cups beef
stock got some kosher salt here coarsely
uh ground and I'm going to be grinding
some uh black pepper it's going to be to
taste going to be using a nice red wine
I personally like the Cabernet s and um
like I said guys if you're going to be
us cooking with wine don't cook with
something you wouldn't drink so it's a
decent wine here okay so we're going to
season the ribs we're just going to keep
it really really simple uh so some
kosher salt fresh brown pepper that's
all we're going to do get all the
sides don't be stingy with the salt and
pepper going to
um sear these outside in just a few
minutes get a nice crust on
[Music]
them all right so I'm going to complete
doing this on all the uh sides of these
things and then we'll take them out
outside and we'll start the actual
cooking process all right so the next
step of this uh cook is going to be
searing these uh pieces of meat now at
this point I've got my uh Dutch oven
here I'm just using my little Weber
Smokey as a more of a cook top I guess
to get this thing heated up more like a
skillet um after I'm done with this
process we're going to be taking it uh
to my bigger Weber where we're going to
be actually using the Dutch oven
um you can use cooking oil oil at this
point kind of lube up the
uh duct oven here but this being
Ballistic Barbecue we're going to use
bacon we're just going to render this
down here to where it gives us
enough
fat to get these uh nice pieces of meat
Steed
[Music]
up all right as you can see got a lot of
good oil going on here took those
um the baking out now we're going to put
these in here it's really important that
you
don't overcrowd this so we're going to
be cooking it in Basking
[Music]
all right so these are done this is the
last batch you can see they're nice and
brown so what we're going to do is uh
the next step which is starting the
brazing liquid so uh let me get these
pulled off and we'll start the next part
of this uh cook here okay so meat has
been
removed get the onions in
there
carrots
[Music]
celery and my
garlic we're going to get this going
just until you know these onions and
everything start to break
down Brown up nice
[Music]
all right so as you can see these things
are really nice and broken down now so
we're going to do is I'm going to add
the uh tomato
paste and again this is 1 6 o can
[Music]
we're just going to keep this in here on
this heat until the uh tomato paste
everything starts to get a real deep red
and already the uh all the like nice
little baked on I call it goodness left
over from that meat has already been
picked up I mean you can see it's kind
of De glazing itself without even adding
the liquid yet so just got that nice red
that I was looking
for I'm going to add that beef broth
[Music]
I'm add that wine the bottle of uh the
Cabernet
[Music]
the
oregano and the
herbs get that stirred in
here okay now what I'm going to do is
just let this come up to a nice boil
before we add the the ribs in and then
we'll take it over like I said I've been
using this as a skillet after the uh
ribs are added we're going to use this
as it was a intended to use as a actual
Dutch oven so we'll be back after this
comes to a boil all right so nice boil
going on now so you know I do realize
that I forgot to add the bay leaves
they're in there
now add this
meat now these
particular short uh ribs I have here
have a pretty thick piece of you know
vein of fat going between that bone and
the meat so I'm expecting if you see
what I mean I'm expecting most of these
to uh lose the
bones doesn't it's not always the case
but on this
particular rack it's going to
happen they're going to be
good but I I usually like to keep the
bone intact you know for the
presentation I guess but oh
well these all added in there
try to get them as covered as with this
liquid as much as
possible see like this this one's losing
the meat
already all right now we're going to go
ahead and get that lid
on now I'll meet you over to the at the
uh Grill all right now I have the um
Dutch oven sitting in my Weber on top of
about 10 L coals and I'm going to go
ahead and put the coals on the top
now usually I like to put 10 on the
bottom about 14 on the
top as you can see these coals are
pretty
small and
what has happened is you know people are
going to be shaking their heads in an in
agreement here making videos while
you're
cooking has uh affects timing quite a
bit and a lot of my coals were withering
as I was doing those other shots and I
was trying to compensate by adding more
unlit charcoal to the chimney and uh
this is definitely going to be hot
enough to do it but as you can see a lot
of these smaller guys are going to
wither as uh as a goes cuz this is going
to be cooking for 2 to 2 and 1/2 hours
so what I'm going to do and this is what
I do um on a longer Dutch oven cook
anyway is simply add some
unlit
briquettes to the
top of the Dutch
oven and these will slowly ignite by the
time these guys are uh
really chugging along these really
little briquettes are going to be gone
anyway so um the Bottom's looking pretty
good I got some pretty decent briquettes
down there um but this is what I would
suggest you guys do you know if you're
doing the longer cooks and you see the
briquettes are kind of withering away
just just add some lit ones or uh unlit
ones here and it's like the minion
method they're going to ignite from the
lit charcoal and they're going to just
chug along so anyway um like I said
about 2 and 1/2 hours and uh we'll be
eating here soon uh another thing that I
like to do is uh about every 20 minutes
I'm going to rotate the whole oven about
a quarter turn and also rotate the lid
the opposite direction about a quarter
turn and that'll just ensure that we're
going to get a nice even cook so anyway
we'll check on in a bit all right so
it's been 2 hours and uh my short ribs
are done I'll go ahead and give you a
really quick look at these things um I
took a peak just a few minutes ago and
they looked amazing
so as you can see the the uh brazing
liquid is reduced
dramatically um just it really smells
good I wish you guys could smell this
all right so my next step is I'm going
to take this in the house I'm going to
remove the uh short ribs pour the sauce
into a I have one of those uh like a
measuring cups that separates the uh you
know the the grease that surfaces to the
Top If you don't have one of those then
I would just you know use a spoon and
ladle off the uh the grease um that
surfaces cuz we're going to use that as
a uh you know as a sauce for the the
ribs anyway I'll uh meet you guys inside
the house all right so here we are um
very very tender some of the bones
actually held which I was happy um made
up a nice creamy palenta uh again I just
Blended up that uh reduction liquid made
a really nice uh sauce some asparagus so
let's uh give this a try here
really really really good really
beefy definite thumbs up on this one
guys anyway um thanks for stopping by
and I'll see you on the next video
