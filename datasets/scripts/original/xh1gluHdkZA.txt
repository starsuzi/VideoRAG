hello and welcome to Doris's kitchen now
today I am joining with my daughter
Jennifer and we're going to make some
turkey
um cupcakes Okay so first what we need
to do is to take our chocolate and we
melt it down in the microwave use a
whole package of chocolate chips put it
in the microwave for about a minute and
then she'll give it straight to you
exactly how you make the feathers
all right and this is kind of how they
all look afterwards and everything and
what you'll do is you do that right on
wax paper and then you'll stick it in
the freezer
okay and then you put your second layer
which will be your front layer it just
kind of makes like straight lines you
know give them like little feet or
whatever you want to call them but the
first layer you make it in circles
loops loops the first one is just
regular chocolate and the second one is
white chocolate which you can add either
a little bit more of brown chocolate to
make it look like that or you can add
food coloring to make it colored all
right and now the next thing we'll
demonstrate for you and then you just
put one there and you'll just frosting
up your cupcakes and everything
she's going to demonstrate how you make
their little faces here
see you could just use a little bit of
white Frost then you put it on there
whoops gotta show it
okay and you put some little jimmies you
know how you use your Christmas jimmies
right there
and then just tip the very end into your
red frosting and then just lay them
right down and there you go
you have their cute little faces
isn't that cute so you just use your
Hershey Kisses
and then there you go you have your nice
little cupcakes right here
so
I'll turn around and first you'll just I
have one of these that just has the
chocolate frosting you just go around
like in a circle
I keep going around the circle
go inside
go around
when you get up to the center kind of
make it a little odd so you know because
turkeys are not straight
there you go
and then you'll just add your feathers
your first layer of feather
it comes right off the wax paper
it's a little hot in the house
and anyhow this is how you end up with
all your little turkeys they're so good
ain't they
all right we'll have to make some more
free some more
and uh because we got 24 of these guys
okay so there you go and this is how you
make some so do it with your family and
everything the kids can join in make
sure that you have these all Frozen
already in the freezer and everything so
when you do put it and then they can
join and just eating them and there you
go
