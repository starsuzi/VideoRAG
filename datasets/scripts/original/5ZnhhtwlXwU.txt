hello YouTube my name's Len Molloy today
we're going to start a new series called
noob tutorials where I teach you how to
do something with all the steps that's
real simple but with a twist
all right so we'll teach you how to blow
big ginormous huge big-ass bubbles
alright so what's the first steps one
get good gum
I recommend big league queue alright
bubble tape do not try to do this with
fruity bubble juicy fruit
that cook no that's chewing them bit we
need big bowl blowing bubble gum big
bubble blowing gum that's what we need
so you have your big league chew
all right well you one do is you know
you you want start kind of small you
won't get kind of like hold on anyone
start kind of small so you want to go in
the bag I get like a handful okay you
want sort too big you will have a lot of
it in your mouth all right ladies I
usually like to get sub in your mouth
okay kind of like soft and easy good
basically goes in one start like to knit
it went nice and compact okay if you
have glasses you can take them off
because you only get bubble on them if
you have a beard well it will get sticky
if you have a mustache it will get sick
because I've got two dumb and then I'll
hum - okay
then you kind of want to just put it
like
number one play them to shut your mouth
I guess it'll calm down your take the
college a guy that can cuz you blow saw
yeah a third yet
we'll get that them bitches to the wrong
guy right now okay see that that take
that's small no then you want to take
another handful from your bag there's a
pop in there walk
anyone do this anything out with
pedaling up penny on how much you can
take a bigger the better
we're just joking around a long time so
keep this family friendly because
