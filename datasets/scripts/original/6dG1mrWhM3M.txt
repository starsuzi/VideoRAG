hi
and welcome back to true's honor
maintenance video series
in this segment we're going to talk
about proper leveling of the cabinet
this is essential to make sure that the
doors close properly
now that we've got that cabinet set
we're going to go ahead and check the
alignment on it
i want to get a small torpedo level
place it right on the center of the
cabinet here
make sure that it's as close to being
perfect as it possibly can be
you want to check left to right and
front to back
the reason that we have to do this is to
make sure that the doors
close properly and proper door alignment
if you don't do this what happens is you
may have a tendency
to the doors not closing properly this
will cause you air leaks and those air
leaks will cost you valuable energy
dollars
please take the time to make sure you
level the cabinet
properly now as we talked about a little
earlier in one of our other segments
the casters that come with your unit
also come with a set of shims
if you need to align the cabinet or make
any adjustment
make sure you take your shims place them
on the cab the caster here and adjust
the caster as tight as you possibly can
into the frame rail please do not use
more than three shims per caster
