all my friends she's going to be a
tutorial for for simple desert scene on
for this plane this is a planet I made
now I'm going to use my good bites I do
and you can see the tutorial oh I do
this in places and now I'm going to make
the tutorial of the I'm going to make
this so the first step I'm going to do
going to put away this I'm going to use
this type this is a big table piece and
I'm going to glue and it's right okay
so I'm going to give this either going
to Tate's
okay so
I too like this
we have to
No
I want more people
Hey
this is a good way to make your planes
at this total so now what Tiger I'm
going to choose a side the front because
I'm going to put the name on here so I'm
going to
put my plane okay now I'm going to put
more in this angle the name it's going
to be like here okay so what I do I
make around random
okay so like this now I like I give this
shape you can make the shape one but I
want to make this shape okay so now we
need to cut each shape don't go too hard
on wood here be more fish thank you
I will explain the mixer table values
and of course the paint's that I used to
so I think we say yes and here I don't
get yes
you can see it's very very to do this
and like I said before it's going to be
the shape you want okay let me this
anymore
first we remove the top
now can go
okay
/ yeah I go again
I'll just remove it okay
so as you can see say like this this is
going to be the front it would use again
and as you can see it's going to have
this the function I'm going to make a
mark here in the back this is
the front okay
so I'm going to put my plane away now
let's talk about the mixture okay the
mixture is very simple we are going to
need water normal water PVA glue okay
this is a normal wood cool Eddy brand
okay
of course we are going to need send this
service is the the finest send off
Twitter okay we are going to need this
too
this is plaster okay so to put here sir
tall papers
I don't want to make it a big mess here
so we are not going to me the big mixer
so I'm going to grab this for put this
and win in these arenas you can push
some rocks best be careful because of
sky - is a 148 screenplay so don't go to
meth
okay
as you can see this is a very thin line
there are lots of materials in the
market they have a great product of
firmly hold the same texture okay
because they it's it's ready to apply
and the color it's a great color for
that so as you can see normal sales
people we don't need too much
just this amount this PVA the PVA glue
it's going to make your cluster to not
crack okay it's going to make the mix
will have some like classically it's a
little band educated and not crack so
now plaster
I'm going to put one cup of this no
first a little 35 of this Cup okay it's
too much I will use water from here it's
very easy for me to make the mixture
okay so it's food and mix this
and I can do this I have this surface
primer from Vallejo this is a desert of
10 I'm going just to put a little of
these okay as you can see
always jump something
okay
as you can see it became to have some
color L not see all that white because
of the person okay and consistent
position it's going to be real nice okay
you must work a little faster with the
plaster because of plaster as you know
it's like real quickly so let's put this
here let's go and put here plus don't
worry because his mixer FDCPA go and
it's going to grip real nice on the
woods and if you don't put any glue make
my crack okay
okay this part is the we see now let's
print the mix
and we are going to put this mix
it's just you can put a match much big
amount of this on the arm of ink paint
in the your mixer but for me I think
this is what I need because I'm going to
use pigments and it's going to make real
goods okay
if you want to put now some of your
rocks some things here it's it's time
but not because it's going to dry it
will became okay so I'm not going to put
any rocks on this okay
that big rocks
what we can do now if advance already in
your your wheels okay and water
now what I'm going to do is create what
this kind of thing
with my step 1 I make he seems to have
some picture
very canceled

my plane is going to be like this so I'm
going to make
some works

No
okay okay so we got this works so now
for clean this only with water
okay
you must clean the plane because we
don't want any mud on this this is a
desert scene okay
simple as that so now let's let this dry
and we come back again I am Telling You
I like going to put some rocks but I
have this this is a cat litter okay and
this is each good to make some little
rocks okay so I put your son on the cave
