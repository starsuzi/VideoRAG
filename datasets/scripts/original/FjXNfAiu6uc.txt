I'm going to share with you today how we
do our chores and the system that we do
for our chores um first of all
we are giving away all five of our books
um this is
dining on a dime
we have 1200 recipes and tips and how to
save on your grocery bill
we have
menus from dining on a dime this is the
menu
the complete menu
from everything from the salads the
dinner everything
and the recipes are in dining on a dime
so we took the recipes from dining on a
diamond made complete menus with them
with this
then we have quick and easy menus this
is both menus and recipes for for
dinners that take less than 10 minutes
to prepare
and then we have Penny pinch Mama 500
ways I lived on 500 a month this is
Mom's Tips how she did it and then dig
out of debt which is
a thousand of the Articles from our
website
people item in print form so that's what
that is at the end of the broadcast I'm
going to tell you how you can sign up
for that I'm gonna give away three
copies
to three of our YouTube
viewers
all right so up with chores
so
one of the reasons why we do chores is
because
kids need to learn how to do these
things
um
you're really doing your children a
disservice if you do not have your kids
doing chores it teaches them confidence
it teaches them basic life skills so
that when they leave home they will know
how to clean the toilet they'll know how
to mow the lawn they'll know how to cook
dinner
and
we start as little as about a year and a
half old and you know you can see here
we had Jack when he was about a year and
a half old had his little broom and he
was helping out and we really when
they're little if I'm cleaning the
windows I will give them
a rag for them to clean and if I'm
sweeping I'll give them their own little
broom to sweep and so
start off little now I realize a lot of
people have not started off little and
if you haven't then you need to start
now
um when you don't give your kids chores
it just makes them spoiled it makes them
lazy and
that is not a good adult to have
kids really need to know how to work and
get these things done at home
efficiently and you're the person who
needs to show them how to do that and
they need to be able to do things like
make their own lunch and if Mom's sick
they should be able by the time they're
12 or so be able to cook simple meals
themselves and keep the house in
semi-decent order by the time they're 10
or 12 so that if Mom's sick it's not a
problem
so I'm gonna show you our specific
chores that we have
and
um
our I have never seen our tour system
anywhere
I've never seen anybody do this and so
I just came up with this I don't know 10
12 years ago when we were desperate for
a way to rotate the chores because I
rotate our chores so the kids can all
learn
the different chores some people will
assign boy Choice chores to boys and
girls chores to girls and that's a fine
system but I do think that the girls
need to know how to mow the lawn and the
boys need to know how to wash the dishes
and do the laundry and so
even if on a regular basis you do that
way they do need to cross over and learn
the other ways to do it um
I do have all the girls and boys MO
and I'll explain that a little bit
further but we do start those bigger
kind of chores when they're about 10 or
12 so that's where we start so here's
our chore system
you can see here that
we have
each of the kids pictures
with the list of chores underneath
and these are all magnets
and what we do is we rotate the chores
in circle so
we go from
the top left we move it over to the top
right the top Right Moves down
to the bottom left and then the bottom
left moves
to the bottom right and then the bottom
right moves to the top left
so what we do is we're always circling
in order now what we do is you can see
here
I have Jack and BJ on the right sharing
that's because BJ's 18 now
and he's working a lot more hours so
he's not always home to get his chores
job done Jack just turned seven so he is
starting to take over BJ's chores so I
will have BJ's do the bigger portions
like the hard vacuuming
um
or the hard like mowing those kinds of
things or whoever's home Jack or BJ will
take over the smaller chores like the
easy vacuuming unloading the dishwasher
that kind of thing
so
on this
chore chart you can see at the very top
where Jack and BJ are it says my week
now what that means is that
that person gets to they get the so to
speak
easy chores and hard chores which kind
of is strange but all the kids hate
unloading or hate loading the dishwasher
so they have the hard chore so to speak
of loading the dishwasher but
the number one at the bottom is the
section that they mow so they have the
easy section of mowing which is the
front yard so I kind of balanced it out
so that if they're doing the yucky
loading of the dishwasher then they're
doing the easy mowing of the yard
and then they're also doing the easy
chore after dinner
um
or the easy chore of doing the tub which
is only once a week instead of every day
for the toilet and the um sink the
bathroom sink so my week means they get
to pick if someone wants to sit in the
front week or in the front seat who's
ever week it is
gets to pick
if they want to sit in the front seat
um if we're going out to eat like at
McDonald's or Wendy's something that
person if there's an argument gets to
choose where we go because it's their
week and that's how we stop fights on
making decisions for things like that so
if we're going to
um a movie which we don't do very often
but if we do they would get to pick
which one we go to because it's their
week and then that rotates every week
they get to pick
now on we'll consider my week week one
and so on that week what they do is they
load the dishwasher
they set the plates on the table
they clean the tub which is once a week
and they vacuum the family room which is
just a small rug we have downstairs and
we do vacuum three times a week we
vacuum on
Monday
Wednesday and Saturday or Friday if
we're doing something on the weekends
Sue says they never complain uh no I
didn't say that
they complain but as you can see I I put
my do everything without arguing or
complaining on there oops I just
realized I didn't have the correct
graphic up there
um my moderator wasn't watching for me
so on here you can see where I was
explaining my week and everything now
sorry guys
um with BJ and Jack on the right
um so
you can see how it says my week on top
so they get to pick the fun stuff and
make the decisions and then they load
set plates clean the tub and clean the
family room then the number one at the
bottom is the section of the yard that
they mow we have a quarter acre lot so
we don't have a huge amount to mow and
the number one is the front yard
then if you go to number two over here
which is David on the left and Dave is
our tech support Guy usually if you see
between BJ and David they keep us up and
running
um or at least keep Mike in life from
strangling the computers
um that person wipes and clears the
table after dinner
they wipe down the windows doors and
mirrors of fingerprints and glop we do
that about once a week they clean the
shower in Mom and Dad's bathroom because
half the kids take showers and half
takes a bath so they help us clean our
shower because they're taking part of
um they're taking showers in there I do
clean our toilet and sink for Mike and I
then they empty the small trash cans
that are in the office and the bathrooms
and then they vacuum the living room
so that's the whole entire living room
and they know they have to vacuum the
rugs bite we have two doors kind of by
our living room so they have to vacuum
those rugs and then they mow
section number two of our lawn so this
here is section number number two of our
lawn and you can see right now that
really it's not that hard to mow there's
not hardly anything there but of course
yes they complain but because of the way
our sprinkler system
um got set up the guy did it completely
wrong I mean he really messed up our
sprinkler system and so our yard only
gets basically partially watered so if
anybody knows of a landscape company
that wants free advertising in exchange
for for fixing it for us hey we'll take
it come on over we'll put we'll do a
home whole show on you guys if somebody
wants to come over and fix this because
honestly we don't we're not going to dig
up the yard now it's just too big of a
job for us to do
um so they mow that section of the yard
then if you go to
section number whoops got the wrong
there okay
so if you go to section why is it
jumping back and forth like
um
it's making everyone see sick sorry guys
which one did you want uh that one this
one yeah
Mike trying to be happy with oh my
goodness are you kidding me
um
okay I'm trying to get the picture on
there
my handsome hunk to burn in love is
trying to get it fixed but yes the girls
well
it's kind of major okay
now
okay give me just a second guys
um
by the way if you guys have any um
questions put them on there we don't
have near as many people since we're
only feeding to YouTube and not Facebook
right now so if you have any questions
pop them up there you'll get
personalized service okay back to the
rest of the chart chores so our chore
chart kind of got mixed up so three and
four got out of order I don't know some
time back probably when I was gone I
went for a month to have a month-long
Vacation by myself and I think the kids
messed it up then so anyway
you can see Emily on the left here so
that person's uh chores for that week is
to take the big kitchen trash out they
always take the trash out they set the
silverware they clean the toilet and
they vacuum the stairs
and then number four is this section of
the yard so they have a little bit more
to mow but they have the easier part of
vacuuming so that's kind of how I even
that out and quite frankly I should have
just made them all just mow the entire
thing but you know when we got it
started we didn't do that and they I'm
sure think they're abused because you
know they have to most so much but oh no
it's jumping again
um
let's try that okay so then I got it
so then the last section of chores is
the person unloads
the dishwasher so in in this case this
week it's Ellie she unloads the
dishwasher she cleans the bathroom sink
she shakes the mats by the
um back door
and she vacuums mom and dad's room the
office and the hallway and again we
vacuum three times a week on Monday
Wednesday and either Friday or Saturday
depending on what we're doing for the
weekend
and
um
they
uh let's see I lost my train of thought
there oh they cleaned the bathroom sinks
and the toilets every single day we
clean the bathroom sink in the toilet
every single day and then for mowing
Ellie does for this week this middle
section of yard
and so that's how we divide up the
mowing between the three of them
um or I mean between the four of them so
we kind of have it divvied up pretty
well I think and then we just rotate
that now at the moment for cooking
dinner I don't have it on the chore
chart but now that David is older I need
to get it on there but
I am having Ellie or Emily and
occasionally now David but mostly Emily
and Ellie
help me like I'll have them make a salad
or I'll have them make dinner or just I
don't usually have them make the entire
dinner but I do have them help me with
that
um Sue says mike keeps smiling
if you guys had any idea what we have
been through I kid you not we spent 12
hours troubleshooting yesterday
we were all just exhausted and I can
tell you I think this is gonna go big
because Satan is really fighting us on
this and we have been having to sing
praise songs
like crazy to try and keep our sanity
because we have no idea why everybody
else in the world can get this live
thing figured out but we can't and I
don't know what's going on but we have
really been working hard trying to and
so like I said right now we're just on
YouTube so you guys get my personal
attention
um
let's see Sue wants to know what age do
you start chores I start about 18 months
and what I start with is having them
pick up their toys
taking their diapers when they're about
when they're about 12 months I have them
take their diapers to the trash can
um it well for the ones that I used
for the ones that I use disposable
diapers on the first two I didn't use
disposable but I used cloth but this
last two I used disposable you could
tell I was getting more Nails I went
along
um
they uh would take their diapers to the
trash and pick up their toys and then
things like if I had a small like if I
found a pop can or something well pop
can is not a good example but because
they could cut themselves on the top but
something you know like a piece of
cardboard or whatever that needed to be
thrown away then I would have the little
kids when they're 18 months old do those
really small chores and things like
um
then things like um
let's see
probably about two or three years old
then I start having
them do things like empty the small
trash cans and help clean out the car
grab stuff in the back of the car and
that kind of thing to get those out
um
thanks Candace I'm glad you could make
it too
um
my kids did I did I say they don't
complain
uh no no it's just oh okay okay yeah no
my kids complain about chores don't
don't think that my kids are perfect by
any means they um
yeah they are the perfect
perfect at whining about it and never
fails oh I gotta load the dishwasher oh
today's mowing day so yeah no my kids do
that all the time so no it's not
um
they complain about the chores they
don't like yeah they complain about the
chores they don't like which is most of
them
but
um yeah so anyway okay did anybody
questions
I will
um tell you that we there are pre-made
chore charts and I put those down in the
description there's one on Amazon and we
do get a small commission if you buy
from there but
um
there are pre-made chore charts if you
don't want to make your own so
you know go to Amazon the one I put on
Amazon was the one that I like the best
so if I was buying one that's the one I
would buy
um also
um I put in a few links on why make my
kids to chores I put in our chore chart
and I also put in another link for
age-appropriate chores for kids
um
then let's see oh and also I was going
to tell you tonight for dinner we had
five dollar chicken we're having five
dollar chicken tacos and I put the link
down there for our five dollar dinner
for tonight so that you can see
um what we're gonna have for dinner so
we're having chicken tacos tonight I
made a roast chicken yesterday
and we had to
run into town to go get more video
equipment to see if that would fix the
problem and so I ended up not being able
to use it so I shredded the chicken and
we're using it for dinner tonight
um let's see computer
nurb says
honestly these are common sense things
but nowadays in society kids are not
have not been through all these things
and they need this to become good
productive people exactly that's the
point you're raising adults you're not
raising kids you're raising adults and
they need to learn how to do this Sue
said are you ever critical if they don't
do the job properly
um am I
probably more than me but we oh thanks
typically we are more so with the
teenagers uh but it's more of a let's go
back out there and we're gonna watch you
do it again yeah
um I get more frustrated
than critical because and I guess it
turns into critical probably in their
eyes because
um we do have the problem where I will
tell someone to do something and it's
like okay I need the dishwasher unloaded
now so we can get it loaded and 10
minutes later I need the dishwasher
loaded now so we can get it loaded
fourth or fifth time around I'm not so
happy
and so uh I tried it I do try to keep my
cool I don't scream and yell at them but
I do get kind of frustrated and like
okay get in here now and mow it's about
to rain we need it mode now let's get it
done so yeah I do that
um
let's see Mom popped in here and said
kids do better if you have chores
written down instead of always just
telling them what to do yes that's true
um if you can see it on the refrigerator
it seems to do better but that still
doesn't they still don't get in there
and just do them
um I have to say that my niece who
um we are
who lives with us we're her Guardians
she is doing great actually I have to
give her Kudos because
um she was an only child and moved in
with four
moved into with four kids and it kind of
was a shock a couple years ago and she
really does great with her chores and so
I have Emily that does really well and I
don't have to ask her and it's just so
nice to go in and have the dishwasher
already loaded or the trash already gone
I mean I do occasionally have to ask her
but it's not all the time and then I
have the opposite in BJ who I have to
tell him 15 times to get up here and mow
the yard so you know we do go back and
forth so that it's kind of
you know we had the whole Spectrum so
anyway
um and we are trying just so you guys
know Candace and everybody else we are
as soon as we can get the technical
problems done we're trying to get Mom on
here and it'll probably be next week
hopefully we'll be able to Skype with
her
I don't know is that being too
optimistic
we may be too optimistic there so anyway
that's what I do for chores and I hope
that gives you guys some great ideas
