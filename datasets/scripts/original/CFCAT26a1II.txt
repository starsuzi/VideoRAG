hi everyone today I'm going to show how
to turn your bulky plastic bags into
cute little triangles that take up next
to no space in your pantry so all you
have to do for this is fold your plastic
bag in
half and then in half
again and then it's just a matter of
folding it into triangle shapes along
the length of the plastic bag try to
keep it fairly tight
and with your excess you just fold it in
and tuck it into the little pocket that
you've made
[Applause]
here flatten it
out and there you have a neat little
triangle thanks
