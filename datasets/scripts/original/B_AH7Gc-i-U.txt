party you're in control first up for Don
knuts is the dough we need strong white
flour dried active yeast some warmish
water a pinch of salt and olive oil as
always just place a strong White flour
into a big mixing bowl dissolve the
yeast in water you can get the exact
weights and measurements down below a
little bit of salt and then combine the
two as you need until it's soft and
elastic you might also want a couple of
tablespoons of olive oil just to
lubricate it obviously you can do this
by hand but we're too
lazy the dough really soft and elastic
now needs to rest in a bowl under a t
toil for about an hour until it doubles
inight
[Music]
are we going to pretend like we stood
there for an hour yeah co co that hour
was long knock it back get rid of all of
the air bubbles and what you have is an
incredible pizza dough that you can use
for 101 different things Pizza a
selection of them you can find on the
eye out there one super malleable pizza
dough classic how are we going to make
it garlicky with an awesome garlic
butter all you need is salted butter
garlic fresh chives and
parsley now these are huge bol of garlic
so two is plenty you might want four
smaller ones all you want to do is mint
or crush them up until it's really fine
and then mix it with salted butter in a
microwave for about a minute so it's the
Butter's just bubbling and the edge is
just coming off the garlic then stir
through chop chives to the parel so we
have ourselves classic pizza dough we
have awesome garlic butter but now they
Collide to form incredible garlic Donuts
have going e KN you're going to have to
demonstrate what we need to
do is a simple thumb
[Music]
now what the dough will do is the Trap
Back on itself so just let it rest a
little bit and then in a couple of
minutes we can trim off the edges so it
looks even simple yes I am ready to give
it a go this is your pizza party get
rolling now you must remind me that
we've left these here because I don't
want to forget me
[Music]
not we're going to use all this D it's
fiddly but a little bit dough goes a
long way waste not one
[Music]
knot to cook our Donuts transfer them to
a baking tin and then brush them
generously with our garlic butter they
need to bake at about 180° C for
is difficult cuz it depends on the size
of your knot but about 10 minutes you'll
know cuz it puffed up and if you pick up
one of them turn upside down and tap it
it will sound
hollow we could just leave the recipe
there but here at sorted we're givers
and we'd like to now show you an amazing
aoli recipe it's kind of a cheat day
early all you need is egg yolk mustard
lemon and garlic oil but I don't have
garlic oil well it's very simple to make
all you need is an ovenproof dish or
Pyrex glass bowl place in some garlic
some herbs of choice
and some oil put it into the oven at 120
or 130° C so that garlic kind of comfies
same method as making Mayo couple of egg
yolks whis up with a dollop of mustard a
squeeze of lemon juice and then
continually whst as you dribble in very
very slowly your oil in this case garlic
oil don't be tempted to dribble too
quick a slow dribble and a continual
whisk then speed up towards the end when
you think you're getting
close there we go plate them up stack
them high and you have yourself garlic
Donuts
[Music]
sorted Michael Brian your mom would be
so proud of you right
now if you don't get the Nobel Peace
Prize for these Mike there is something
very wrong with this
world a thank you guys do you know what
if I had to choose between these or the
chuna katsu curry that we made on Friday

take all the credit you know I've had
lots of help in the kitchen and with the
