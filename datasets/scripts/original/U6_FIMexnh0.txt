hey y'all this is Eric me sex
homestead.com and today I want to talk
to you guys about chisels so do any of
yall have a chisel that looks like this
I sure hope not um but I do and um I'm
going to show you an easy way to fix
it I learned this method from Cody over
wranglerstar dcom and it's really simple
and effective all you're going to need
is some sandpaper right here I've got
some wet dry sandpaper I've got um an 80
grit a 150 and a 320 now you can go U
much coarser at first if you if you need
that or if you have it um and you can
even go much finer than the the 320 um
but these are the three that I have you
can see they were on clearance so I
picked them up and you going to need
something to stick them to I've got um a
2x6 here and a 2X
4 all right so I've stuck a piece of the
320 on this side of this
2x4 and then a piece of the 80 over here
excuse me the 150 on this side and the
80 here on this now I prefer this this
long um long piece um or the the style
but since this was on sale um it'll work
just fine um the aim is to um just get
long consistent Strokes
and um here you just gota got to work a
little bit more it's not not as um not
as easy but it's really not a big deal
so um next I'm going to get a little bit
of water and um Cody over English star
likes to use kerosene or diesel fuel um
I don't really think I want to mess with
that right now um I'm sure it works a
lot better at um helping remove the the
metal particles it probably makes your
sandpaper last
longer but
um I find the water works just
fine you can see that after just a
couple minutes we're we're already
wearing back the old messed up chipped
edge here so it was significantly deeper
we're getting farther back in there so
we just want to make long strokes
drawing backwards keeping it as flat as
possible so we want to leave this
Edge going leave this Edge as as flat as
as as we can possibly keep it so it's
real
important all right so after to work on
it for a few more minutes um you can see
that I've almost got the chips out
got a little more more work left to do
on
it just about wore out this piece of
sandpaper so I'm going to go ahe and put
a fresh one
on
so after you've been working on a while
you'll feel a burr on the back and just
take your chisel lay it flat pull it
backwards just a little
bit wipe it
off oh
yeah look at
that
beautiful let's move on to the next
grd an easy way to find the right angle
is you can start moving forward and
leaning the Chisel forward until you
just start to catch the edge that's when
you know you've got it just
right so after working it on the 320
grip for a while and this thing is
polished
sharp man I think sharp so that's a
quick and easy way to recondition a
chisel even if it looks like it is in
terrible condition you can still bring
it
back
