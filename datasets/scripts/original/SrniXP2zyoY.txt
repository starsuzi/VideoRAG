hello Chancellor here just your
neighborhood amateur artist today I will
be teaching you how to make your own
blending
stick so first let's gather our
tools for this project you'll need
scissors a piece of computer paper and
some
[Music]
tape all right let's begin by getting
out our piece of computer paper fold
that in half increase the edge next
you'll be folding the other opposite two
edges with about an inch from the bottom
bottom
right next we will cut off that folded
Corner Edge and then open up cut down
the
middle very good all right so now that
we've got that half a sheet you'll start
and this is the hardest part start very
slowly in the beginning try and get a
tight tight
cylinder then begin to roll towards the
opposite Edge making sure to pull away
from the outer edge to try and tighten
up that cylinder this is the slowest
process this is the hardest part and
with practice you can do
[Music]
it if at any point in this how-to video
you are lost or confused simply rewind
and watch
again all right so again this is the
longest part and with practice you'll
nail
it all right so I'm going to jump ahead
a little bit here and once you have it
nice and
rolled it will look something like this
so what you want to do is tape that
Outer Edge away from the point and cut
with
scissors there now you have your own
homemade
tortillion or blending stick
you can make different sizes different
widths it's all up to
you all right you got your blending
stick but what is it going to do for you
feel free to stop the video or you can
watch this short tutorial on how to use
your blending stick all right so you've
got your graphite laid
out but it's looking choppy and that's
not good so use our blending stick that
we created go back in follow the line of
the body or whatever shape you're
working with and I like to work in tight
circles I like to work to left or right
it's all up to you it's all on the user
if you do this correctly everything will
look smooth you'll see no lines you go
back in add more
darks and everything will be
great I'd like to thank you for watching
today and don't bother spending any
money on tortillons
