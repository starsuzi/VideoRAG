hi I'm David mate your host for hot
bartenders LA and today we're going to
do the chocolate martini
um this is not a drink that you would
probably want to drink if you were on a
diet it's got a lot of calories but it
does taste good so I'm going to start
off with a dry martini glass we're going
to get a chocolate design just pour in
here real quick so I use my little
Hershey's just something like that
and I go along with a pint with just a
little bit of ice we're going to do one
and a half ounces of vanilla vodka so I
like to use a [ __ ] for accurate pour
so one and a half rents there
along with half ounce of Bailey's Irish
Cream
and
a quarter ounce of our creamed cacao
and about a half ounce of whole milk
don't bother using skim milk it's kind
of like going to McDonald's ordering
four cheeseburgers and a Diet Coke
it'll taste better trust me so I dump
that in there
shake it up just a little bit
there you go get a strainer
and we're going to pour that right into
the Marty martini glass with the
chocolate syrup
and there you go
