so the first thing you do is your baking
soda and lemon juice let me out
so whatever is in cake or making cake
huh okay so then you sprinkle your
favorite so - oh because the boovie cake
I made for my stepdad okay so then
you're gonna sprinkle it onto the area
pretty yeah like that that's good that's
perfect
yep that's great make sure it's all
covered I like it stuff and then you're
gonna put lemon juice on it
a splash of lemon juice this is our
assistant really yeah ideally oh oh this
is what's this bad I didn't
make sure you get over here a little bit
things actually are just would clean my
car battery and probably would I think
it's like basically the same as vinegar
but not better women clothes better
okay so currently 11 not 1122 assignment
right but that's Tomatoes I'm there but
really on 22 we'll leave it on there for
a few minutes then we'll come back and
see we are probably in Folkestone
fizzling so rack and it's 11:30 now
that's been about a minute so we're
going to go ahead and scrub it up see
how it works
you
take a lot of stubborn she's like it
good yeah a little force behind it any
more than you would claim while you
clean the freezer so no it's a looser
than if I just try to use soap water
yeah
you
yes looks really good it looks brand-new
nice difficult shot do it
Joplin's gonna try his method uh well is
it a raisin it's the box
you
so pick up up the fun
so yeah scrub as hard as you did from
like you scum for like two minutes if
that stop right so just scar for two
months and see what happens
those are just water
you
feel like for the Lebanon came with a
little spray bottle yeah I'll probably
help don't think you need that much
being said on your own do the back one
too
we're doing it I love dude oh sure now
if you're going to use it mix it around
many ways
you
okay well that's it welcome back and
it's not League on I think uh getting
the bulk of it off first cleaning it
with hat so a mixture five can Wow not
like putting forth
yeah I have to do money I don't know
this one what nearly is no no barely is
our that's cool he's gonna be masculine
so here's our final product pretty
freakin happy about this all these
things are the edges are gone you can
actually see your reflection this is
crazy see my reflection on the glass top
stairs that's crazy
okay so overall what did you think the
lemon juice baking soda worked really
good yeah didn't take a whole lot of
scrubbing and cleaned it up really nice
yeah definitely um the supplies are
pretty much stuff that you have around
your house already so I don't think the
cost is really much I already have
baking soda obviously and the line of
lemon juice I have if you wanted to buy
lemon building for $4 and then go
yeah what do you think about it was it
bad do you think it was effective yeah
it works really well which I was
surprised
um easy was easy
yes I think that if you do the razor
blade and then wave it or let it sit and
we're always it down that will you up
but if you don't have a razor blade this
one works just as well we're just a
little bit elbow base so oh girl thanks
good pin yes so till next time bye bye
bye friends bye bye bye thumbs
