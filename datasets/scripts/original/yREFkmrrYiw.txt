welcome to my kitchen I'm Clara I'm 91
years old today we are making meals from
the depression
good morning we're going to make egg
drop soup
today of course we have we have to have
our
potato and eggs and onion to start so
I'm going to peel the potato during the
Depression everything had potato now you
could see why we would buy a whole bag
of potatoes
I didn't remember exactly how it's done
so I called my
brother and he told me about the
potatoes I didn't I didn't think this
had potatoes in but I guess he was
right my brother was a different type
all together than I
am slow
easygo I'm not easy
going tell you that much I think it's
better like I am I flare up and then I
get it over with people that don't get
mad when they get mad
beware potatoes are all diced now I'm
going to put the
onion you notice all the meals I made
have the same
ingredients onions
potatoes after your onion and the
potatoes are diced and I put olive oil
now after you Cube these
vegetables put the olive oil and then
you put them on the stove to Brown
them next I get the eggs ready but we
won't put them in until later now I just
brown
leaves put some bay leaves
salt and
pepper you can make these at home
now
variety potatoes and onions they're not
not red yet they're getting there
yeah my brother played a real bad trick
on me one time he put a a little garer
snake in the envelope put it in the
mailbox with my name and
address so I thought I was getting some
meal and when I picked up the Ember it
start wiggling and I thought I'd die I
was so
scared he he got a good whipping that
time okay now the things are Browning so
I'm going to put water
in about a half a pot
full okay put it back on the stove to
make the broth you you put water then
you put salt and pepper in the water and
cook it with the potatoes that's it
nothing to
it let that simmer for a while I'm going
to taste this see if there's enough salt
in there
need a little more
salt more
pepper now we let this boil the potatoes
have to cook so we have to wait a while
before we put the eggs
in that's that's as far as I could do
now
the potatoes are cooked already now we
got to put the eggs in there I have to
scramble
some then the others will leave
whole why these are really
Brown
W that's this the next one I'm going to
leave a
hold well I put enough water for I put
six eggs first four you scramble in the
the
pot stir it so they
scramble and then the other two or how
many people you have to eat you leave
the EG hole when you serve it you have
the person that's going to eat it have a
whole EG
I hope it tastes okay oh you got to put
the cheese
in at the end just
before you put the cheese
in at the end you put the cheese you
stir it and that's this turn it off
and ready to
eat last for a special surprise you put
the bread and pour the soup over it and
an egg on top I prefer toast so we're
going to toast the
bread this is how you make egg soup when
which was very inexpensive and very
nutritious and very
good after you make the soup you sit
down because you're tired
