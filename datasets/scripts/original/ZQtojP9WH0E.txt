this is the top of my wind Chine piece
of plastic I think it's
a uh
lexan lexan lexan doesn't pull it's
softer it doesn't pull when you drill a
hole in it it doesn't pull up on the on
the uh on the drill uh what I did was I
laid it Crossways
drilled a hole in the center I drilled
and then I drilled well first before I
drilled I drill a circle on it what that
did was gave me all the holes for my uh
for my uh
uh strings anyway the uh then then after
I crossed it this way then I crossed it
the other way I divided in E so I got
two strings for each tube two here two
two here two here two here but but four
of them I drilled a double
hole I drilled another hole outside of
it about a quarter inch for this string
here took this string this is this uh
this construction nylon string you don't
want to get too heavy and you don't want
to get too
light uh one time a guy said well I'm
going to string my tubes with oh I got
some real heavy stuff Stu if you do
you'll kill the sound of your tube your
tube won't ring if you got too heavy of
a string and if too light it won't last
long it'll break and you have to keep
doing it put it back on there so anyway
the hole there two holes there two there
two there two there two there and then a
fourth of eighth of that one one one and
one that's all you got to do on on one
Circle okay now the hole that I drilled
in there is very important
it's got to be just big enough to get
that string through there I heat that
you got to heat it to cut this stuff
otherwise it'll Fray You I heat it with
a lighter and break it and then I roll
it up to a point this way it will go
through there it's stiff and there's a
stiff point on there and it'll go
through there so if it don't then I can
take a straight pin and just push it
through pull it out the bottom and then
I just tie a knot on it I tie a knot on
the end well once you melt the end of it
you got the end melted it won't pull
through that knot it'll stay it'll stay
out because it's it's stiff okay so
that's all I do for the
knots okay this is this is two pieces of
string I cut them both the same length
then I looped them I looped them and
tied them that holds them together like
that okay makes it simple I made it as
simple as possible okay then the next
thing I do is I I make my uh tubes okay
here's my
tubes
this is an old handrail it's great
because it's painted if you
use unpainted metal it'll rust which is
okay you can use copper you can use
aluminum conduit it ain't it ain't
painted so what it'll do it is it will
turn real gray on you it's still good I
got one out there that's 30 years
old and uh about the same as this one
big one and then then when you do here's
the most important thing you tune
them if you don't tune them they sound
like junk rattling do you ever hear a
wind Chine where it sounds like junk
rattling I made one one time like that
and I didn't tune it I gave it to my dad
and gave it back he says I don't want
that it just sounds like it's annoying
it sounds like junk Rattle and it don't
sound like music playing and I
want all right so I took it back it was
a was there were flat pieces of metal
like
Chimes and I didn't have them tuned so I
had to retune them to make it sound like
anything anything the other thing about
it is when you cut a tube when you tune
it
you you keep grinding it see I I did
this one on a lathe I cut the ends of it
and I keep and you keep you start out
long and you grind it down and cut it
and cut it and cut it until your tuner
that's my Chromatic
tuner that's my Chromatic tuner it does
a hard job it's hard for these
things you see
that see that that needle goes up and it
should be right in the middle
pretty close and it tells you this is a
c e e it does give me a lot of
trouble but it's supposed to be a I
don't
know I think it's a uh
E I think it's an e it's a little bit
low but I could have but I did it at
work and I didn't have my tuna didn't
work doesn't work at work
it's too noisy and this thing just goes
nuts so I use the
horm and what you do here's the other
thing when you drill your holes in
there what you do is you start you don't
have if you don't have holes hold it
like this right it won't ring move your
fingers down starting to
ring there's certain spot in
there where it rings the best
that's why I put the
holes right
there
so then I you put the holes where it
rings the best all right you don't put
them anywhere you don't just put them
anywhere uh so the other thing is the
other thing
is uh I if sometimes you see them cut on
an angle at the bottom oh boy they're
going to sound like junk rattling cuz
when you do that your tuning just goes
nuts because you got two different
lengths you got this length and you got
this length and when they vibrate when
they vibrate the middle is moving this
way and the ends are moving the opposite
way and if you got the ends out of
balance one's lighter than the other if
you got that angle cut on there it's
going to sound bad so don't ever buy one
that's got
the uh tubes cut on an angle okay then
what you do when you put them
on when you put these
on what I like to
do is put all the bottoms
level and the reason why I do that is
because then your
Clapper then your Clapper can hit them
all e evenly some people Center them all
up they Center them they get them just
like like this and they put put all of
them in order like this and hang them
that way and then put the Clapper
somewhere so it hits them all the same
uh it don't make a lot of difference I
got I usually hit the I usually hit it
at the bottom low and the reason why I
do that is because when you got your
Clapper you got your CLA cler string I'm
rebuilding this I got this one this one
is all need to be cleaned and fixed if
you got your Clapper up high it's a lot
more wind to get it to move to hit them
but if you got your Clapper down low it
just barely swings and Bing Bing Bing it
don't it takes a lot less wind if you
got it down low so basically what I
normally do is line these up at the
bottom and I put my Clapper way down
here and then depending on how long this
is the farther down you go the easier it
is for to wind to move the higher it is
the harder it is for the wind to move
and
also the bigger this is the more sa sail
area you got here the more it'll move so
this one basically moves most of the
time when there's a storm coming it
takes about a 5 mph win or 10 to do it I
didn't want it to ring all the time CU
it drive me nuts
so when they ring they give you a
warning of
uh of uh there's something that there's
something common same thing with this
here I drill the same size hole that I
drilled for this I forgot what size but
it has to do with the diameter of the
string and if the string
is uh it's just got to just barely fit
through there so that when you tie a
knot on the end you just tie a knot on
it
and it sits on the nut and it won't pull
out so I got to clean this all up I got
it off the ground it broke down and fell
on the ground and it was all dirty so I
washed this all off this was dirty and
this was dirty the tubes were
dirty so anyway what I got to do this is
how long my Clapper was I don't know how
long and I just stick this through the
top through the hole tie a knot on it so
what I'll do is once I get these on
there I'll pull the string down pull it
down to where I want this tied on and
cut it off a little bit
longer this here boy that's rough boy
it's been out there this been out there
for about
uh I last time I rung it was probably 3
years ago four no more than that
10 I got to put new string on
there I put the string that's got a hole
in it the same size hole as all the
holes are all the same size I push it
through there tie a knot on it uh so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to I'm going to cut it I'm going to cut
the video and I'm going to I'm going to
hang these up and show you how I hang
them up
okay the next thing I did was I cut a
whole bunch of strings long
enough long enough so that I
could adjust them up and down I put my
tube on there put it through the hole
and pull the tube up just to where I
want
it and then tie the
knot cut that off burn it
off so I made long strings on it okay
just's one thing I didn't say when you
when you
uh when you drill the holes in
this I got 8 in holes they're kind of
small and it's hard to get the string
through I think I've been going bigger
like a
3/16 this is an older one this one's
this one's 20 years old and it still
looks good cuz it was painted it's
binged up but it's uh it was painted it
was a handrail an old handrail was taken
out so I cut it up in pieces and made a
windchime out of it I've made aund
Windchimes
uh anyway when you once you get through
there you uh once you drill through that
you got to take the bur take the sharp
edges off and I got a little deburring
tool I take the sharp edges off and then
I I a scraper and I scraped the scrape
the corner the top corner where it rubs
make sure that's round on both sides and
then when you stick it through there it
wraps around that corner it won't cut it
it won't uh it won't cut the string
otherwise if that's sharp the string
will cut after a while and it'll fall
off so anyway so here's what here's what
I do I'll see if I can get this what's
what are we going to put first let's put
on the uh sh the shest
one you try to match them up
okay you match them up with with the
uh
uh the length if you put the shortest
one opposite of the heaviest one what
will happen is your Windchime will be
real heavy on one side you know what I
mean it'll be real heavy and it might
sit crooked
so here's what I do there's my first one
now what I'll do is I'll poke it through
the hole
I think I checked all the if you if you
when you when you melt this if you get
one of them little strings on the end oh
they really help you a
lot you know what I'm doing I got the
weight of this thing okay now I'll push
this through
there and I'll pull this
up and I'll say well I don't know that's
probably this is the shortest one so
it'll probably have the most Gap here
so I'll take it and I got a what I got
to tie I'm about to tie about 2 and2
Ines on there something like that
okay okay that's my first one the
shortest one now the second shortest one
will go the opposite you want to the
closer the length they are opposites so
if you got eight when I put eight of
them on there sometime I got eight of
these things on there all tuned in in
keys that you put the the next next one
to it Opposite and the reason why is so
that it don't hang like this where it's
out of whack so I'll take the next one
see if I can do this real quick I don't
want to make this video too
long but
uh I can I can look down in there and I
can see the hole and I usually they
usually don't take long to get them
through there
you know but that's why I said I I go to
a bigger
hole which don't mean nothing as far as
the sound
goes
okay okay I got this one now this one
will be right opposite so it'll be the
hole
opposite maybe I'll hold it like
this most of the time I lay them on a
table but this one here is so
big that uh
that
I getting away on me it's so big that
it's hard to
uh I had fatter legs I can grab that
tube
tighter okay here we go here we
go okay
now let's let's line up the bottoms
halfway decent you
know
too okay so I'm going to put it right
about
there I need a a nut right
there that's my next
one all right now I'm not going to do
all I'll go ahead and do the other
two by uh and then cut off the uh cut
the video so it's not so long show you
what I'm do next and how I do The
Clapper all
right okay I got them all TI tied it on
now the next thing I'm going to do see
all these are different lengths because
depending on where you want that the
line I've got the bottoms mostly all
lined up then you take these off see
what you do is you get them hot break
them off and then you kind of wad it up
and it makes a little ball on the end
where it won't pull through the
knot like
that okay
trying to do this fast so I don't get
too long of a
video okay and then if you got one let's
say you got one that wants to come
untied let's say that one there wants to
come untied what you
do is you just go like this and heat
that sucker
up heat the end of it if there's a
little pie sticking out like that see
that little ball there it was a point
now it's a
ball see that there's some that that's a
point that I shov through actually I
shove this one through but that's a
point that I uh tied to not I make a
point on both ends so I one end usually
is better than the
other okay now they're all through there
okay okay I had to hang this up higher
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to make a string for my Clapper so
what I'm going to do is go okay I want
my Clapper to B if you hang it down too
far only every every little breeze will
make it ring and it might get on your
neres so I I hang it down just about oh
probably that far probably be good okay
and that's what I do with
my that's what I do with my
uh okay that's my Clapper string I'll
tie a knot on it and pull it through
okay okay the next thing I'll do is tie
this
on find out where it hits them hits them
all you got to make sure you hit them
all they're not
level okay that don't matter
the short one is up okay so I'll tie a
knot right there that's where I want my
Clapper to be up
high up pretty high so
[Music]
that and it's a little
high I could lower it down if I untie
this and lower it down a little bit
okay that's
better and
then depending on how how much wind you
get you uh this the longer you make it
the more it don't take hardly anything
to move the other thing is how heavy is
this is how loud it is and also how far
away you don't want to get it too close
to these otherwise it'll do this
[Music]
it'll hear
that I guess that's not too bad so I got
him about a/ in apart from there so
depending on how far apart they are here
depends on also how big that is I've
never made two of
them the
same I've made the of them and there was
no two alike I just start making them
and putting them together then I do the
same thing with this that hole all those
holes are the same
size and it's just a real small hole I
think it's a
16th and I'll put this on there tie a
knot on the end of it just like I do
every one of
them and then
uh there it is it's ready to go back
outside so I hope I hope I covered
everything this is thin this is eighth
of an
inch uh I've used plexiglass I've
used uh
polycarbonate any any junk you can find
I've used uh stainless
steel I've used
uh
um aluminum
16 gauge
aluminum and you can pick any kind of a
pattern any kind of a shape you can put
your initials on there you can put
anything you want on the bottom of here
as a wind catcher that's your wind
catcher like I say the longer you bring
that down the less wind it takes to move
and it also has to do with how far apart
these Gap your Gap is whenever you're uh
make this round piece the round piece it
don't have to be uh perfectly round it
can be uh octagon it can be uh just I I
just draw a circle and grind it around
with a a grinder and then and also what
I did
was I rounded the corners off of it if
you don't round these Corners off it
could dent and put take the paint off
and ding it so you want you want The
Clapper to hit in the
middle round Clapper is better than a
square flat Clapper is not good because
it will actually Dent the uh
aluminum
okay so I think I'm about done with
that
[Music]
uh I don't normally show people my cow
bells I make those I used to make
them that's a d
