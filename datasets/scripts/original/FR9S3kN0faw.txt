today I'm going to show you an easy way
to sew on a button you take your
thread I'm using dark thread so you can
see it if you're sewing your button on
make sure it matches the top and the
button that you're using you need two
feet of thread it doesn't have to be
exact if you don't have measure right
there two feet is usually from your
shoulder
down you thread the two ends through the
needle there is a right and wrong side
to a needle so if you can't get it to go
through the first time turn the needle
around and try from the other
direction pull those two ends
through and down here where the loop is
and these ends get them all
together and then you're going to put a
knot I don't care how you tie it just
get a knot put in there any way if
you're a beginner just I do it this this
way but you can do it any way to get a
knot then you
take your shirt if that's what you're
putting it on sometimes you can't see
where the button supposed to go this one
I can see a little bit of a hole and I
could tell but if you can't what you do
is you button the button at the top and
the button below where you're working
you go straight down the button
hole like
that I unbutton the other two
pull the thread on
through I take the
button I'll go ahead and come
up come up right next to where that knot
now see I put the knot on this side
because you don't want the knot to show
on the other side of the shirt and then
I'll just come up close by
it I'll put the needle through one hole
of the button
I take and lay a little pin on here
whoops need to go on the other direction
I lay a pin on there because you want
kind of a shank to
form um so the button won't pop off as
well it loosens it just slightly now I'm
going down the next side
whoops I'm trying to keep it so the
camera can see it okay here
and
then I tried to come up the same hole to
make it look neater and you can just you
may have to fill around
sometimes and then I go back down once
again I look to see am I close to the
same where I came out it doesn't have to
be exact that's twice because I have
four strands of thread on here I only
have to come through this button twice
remove the PIN
I tie a
knot I just wrap it around twice round
the needle twice pull it
through I slide I like to slide my
needle under a little bit and pull that
because then it buries the knot and it
won't come out as
easy cut that off and I want you to be
sure to make note I got this one a
little bit more crooked but to be be a
little bit careful when you do it
because you want to make sure the holes
go the same direction I didn't want the
holes to go that way I want them to go
the same direction if you have a button
with four holes you do it just the same
you do
two the two sides and then the other two
sides and that's how you sew on a button
