hi everyone hey it's Diane today we are
going to be repotting a moranta house
plant also known as prayers plant and I
purchased it here about a week ago and I
know it needs to be repotted and I found
a pot for it and we're going to do that
today this is a beautiful plant it's got
beautiful markings and they call it
prayers plant because it folds up at
night so let's get
started all right let's get repotting
this little guy here
I got some dirt in my it's an 8 in pot
let's pull this out and look at
it and as you can see nice Roots
probably entangle them just a little bit
be careful with
it and kind of inspect your plant before
you repot it
and get the Dead Leaves out if you
can you're going to place it in this pot
here kind of get the right height I
don't want it too deep and I want it
about just a little bit
below a little bit below the opening
here see I don't can and it can be
adjusted put some soil in
there pack it not pack it real hard but
kind of work it down in between
there isn't this a beautiful
plant now these guys like to be kind of
moist in the spring and summer and it
says they kind of go kind of dormant in
the winter which indoors they maybe need
a little less water but they like to be
misted um they got to have high humidity
and that's one thing that's kind of
important so that's why you know you
want
take you know something to M them with
and as if you don't you're going to
notice they're going to start on the
tips will start getting brown but that
can also be caused by um too dry it can
be caused by um uh the Water you know
you just don't know so but missing them
is really going to help and that kind of
brings out the beauty in them
really so the soil I use was the Pete
and perlite which is a soil I always use
a PRX it's got a little bark in it also
but the moranta you know it's just it's
just a beautiful plant um you can take
some cuting from this in the spring uh
right I would say when you go to cut
them you cut them below the node here
and you can make some new plants um put
them in a if you want them to root it
kind of says to put them in a a little
baggie and stem it says stem cuting can
also be taken from spring to early
summer take the cuting just below the
nodes closest to the bottom of the stem
cuttings can be placed in a mixture of
moist Peete and perlite cover with
plastic to to retain moisture
levels you may want to poke a few holes
in the plastic to allow for adequate
ventilation place the cuting in a sunny
location what I would probably do to
make my own is what I've done with a lot
of my plants is um just put them in some
soil and and uh put my
my uh put them in a flat and then put
the Dome lid on them so what's that look
like and get you a little closeup
here as you can see why they're so
beautiful they got the red
veining and these like I said they close
up at night they like they're preying
that's why they're called the prayers
plant but let's give a little moisture
here now these like indirect bright
light they're kind of considered a low
light
plant as far
as where you want to put them but I
think some good lighting will do them
good but no no direct sunlight it'll
probably burn the leaves so there you
go back
out that's all she wrote anything else
I'm trying to think of what else I can
tell you about them but I love this
plant I've had it before but we'll see
how it does here in the winter indoors
cuz it gets pretty dry here in the
Midwest when we got the heat on but you
can also yeah for humidity you can also
place this in a on a tray with some
pebbled rock and some water but don't
let it set in the water okay that's
another way you can keep it moist so I
hope you enjoyed this video I think it's
a beautiful plant look at that I'm going
to love having it in my my room up there
and and you know next year I might to
have a video on doing the stem cuting
and doing that so I hope you enjoyed
this video um comment share it um like
the video If it
helped and I'm just trying to think if
there's anything else I can tell you
about
it I had a little sheet here that kind
of helped me with it um as far as
pest um it says that they're prone to
pest such as Spider mes meie bugs and
it's it's good ideal and ins new plants
thoroughly before bringing them indoors
well yeah if you're going to have it
Outdoors bringing it indoors like in the
fall it can drag you can drag some pest
in I've done it I don't like it cuz they
spread to the other plants so it's
something you got to think
about so anyway thanks so much again
this is the moranta prayers plant very
pretty you guys take care we'll see you
on the next one
