okay basically for the sake of this
demonstration I am just going to use a
shirt that I was actually tie dyeing and
I used a little too much bleach this is
what became of it so if you ever if you
use bleach
of maybe take out a color that's already
in the shirt I would recommend uh
getting that bleach out right away
because it will eat up your um your
clothing
unfortunately uh this here is some
experimenting that I was doing with
paint and I actually didn't do it this
the way that I'm showing you I actually
brushed the paint onto the and uh
diluted it with with rubbing alcohol
which worked too it it's really not that
stiff but then in doing all this
experimenting I came up with a different
way and so that's what I'm I'm showing
you now is is how I I the process that I
actually came up with so what I'm going
to do now with the rubber
bands there's a whole lot of different
ways you can tie dye to get different
patterns I got this pattern for instance
I
rolled the shirt
this way
lengthwise and then I twisted it like
this all right and
I wrap a rubber band around
it want to make sure it's good and
twisted and then wrap your rubber band
to tighten up that
twist kind of
giving keeping the rubber
band distanced if that makes any
sense and I'll show you what I
mean okay you see that
there's all kinds of things you can do
you know once
you start getting into the whole d tie
dye process you'll start coming up with
more ideas
yourself that's what usually happens
especially if you're a crafty
person all right so now just for the
sake of this demonstration I think that
I
have placed the rubber
band okay my camera keeps some shedding
off I'm just going to choose I already
made up a few a few colors
here so one of the things I learned
about alcohol is that it absorbs into
the fabric and it spreads the
color so I've poured a little bit of
purple in that one orange in this
one and I think this
one's this is pink like a purple and
this is a pink yeah let's do this one
pink
now let's let's get started with this so
what I like to do
is brush it on because then I have a
little bit more control over where it
goes and I like to brush it in
between in between the uh the rubber
band here so I'll just kind of show you
what I mean you just start dabbing it on
and you'll notice how it just absorbs
right
in and it's kind of cool to separate it
like this too the
colors you'll know what I mean when you
do this for yourself it's an awesome fun
project to do with you and the kids or
or just by yourself really um I used the
little uh paint container over here with
um mixture of like soapy water just to
kind of rinse off my brush you kind of
don't really want to mix the colors just
yet or you don't want to mix it onto the
brush you know you just want to kind of
clean off your brush each
time
my dog is over here
talking she's trying
to get a
biscuit Okay so we've got the purple
we've got the
orange now we're going to do some
pink one of the things you'll notice
like I don't know if you can see this
but this color right here still has some
of those little
particles um it's it's not completely
cleared out it looks like
and it makes like little dots if you see
that happening the best thing to do
um rinse it off with some alcohol and
try to rub it
in so that it
doesn't so does it show up on your on
your on your on your
clothing yeah it might be on the brush
or
something
what also you can do is strain it twist
it
and let the colors kind of bleed into
each
other and what I do is I kind of just
set it aside and let it dry before I
remove the rubber
band and like I said you can play around
and do whatever you want um but while
this dries I'm going to go ahead and and
work on the next one this is just to
give you an idea of of what you can do
using acrylic
paint and it is a little bit of a
process uh to get your colors using the
acrylic paints and the and the you know
the straining method and all
that but hey I mean anything you do with
crafts you're going to have
you're going to have a little little
work in involved even when you go Bu The
Powder you still have to mix it it's a
little bit easier of course you're not
straining and all
that really works into the
fabric and you can also do a dipping
method too just kind of dip it
in
okay I think we're going to be ready to
open this up and just take a look at
it
go this is basically what became of
it and as
I said um you can do
any Rubber Band Method twist method dip
method anything
anything you want the choice is yours
you
can take the colors
and just kind of dab it
on to give it those you know to give it
lines this is what I kind of do
sometimes afterwards to kind of blend in
the lines a little bit and just kind of
give it more of a
definite
um
stripe when you twist it that way you're
only going to get one side at a
time so like this one I just got one
side so what you have to do is when you
roll it you you got to roll it the
opposite direction to get the
um to get the lines on both
sides you'll see what I mean when you
start playing around with it
not sure if you can see this kind of
losing my lighting a little bit
here but there you have
it this concludes my tutorial on how to
use acrylic
paint making your own tie-dye shirt of
it good luck have a lot of fun and keep
me posted as to how it went for you if
you have any questions just go ahead
head and ask and I'll try to get back to
you as soon as uh possible thanks for
watching I appreciate
it
