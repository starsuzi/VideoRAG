hello this is Matt from Ace Appliance in
Toledo Ohio welcome back to another
inhome diagnostic video brought to you
by appliancevideo.com
okay uh what we have here is a Kenmore
direct drive washer it's basically it's
built by Whirlpool uh C custom complaint
is that it fills up with water and does
nothing nothing else basically when you
pull the timer knob
out you know it's it's full of water but
it's not doing
anything so what we are going to do you
take a putty knife go up underneath the
panel
here depress the
tabs pan pel flips open just like
this and we going to go ahead and unplug
it
here all right uh this is our lid switch
here we're going to go ahead and
disconnect this uh you got your green
wire which is a ground wire then the
other two wires are the ones that are
going to actually complete the circuit
so what we have is just a a little
jumper uh if you don't have a jumper
wire you can just strip down a piece of
wire and put it in between the White and
the gray and just kind of basically
you're just completing the Circuit of
the lid
switch so we got the jumper wire there
we're going to go ahead and put that
in go ahead and plug this back in
here and it started working
so we know the issue is with the lid
switch uh so what we're going to do is
just go ahead and replace the lid switch
on
here go ahead and unplug
it flip the panel back open
here take our jumper off we're just
going to go ahead and remove the 56
screw that goes to the ground wire on
here
going to lift the lid up to release the
tension on the door switch you got a
little tab right
here just going to depress
that pop the switch
out we've got our new Switch
here go ahead
and put that in
place snap it in just like
that should hear that clicking when you
close the
door so you know that contact is
closing go ahead and put our ground
screw back in okay uh so we're going to
go ahead and just tighten the ground
screw down

harness okay uh we're going to go ahead
and flip the control panel forward
