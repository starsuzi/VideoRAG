hey everyone awesome Disney toys here
and we're making another gummy soda
bottle we've already done Sprite orange
soda Cola and a few other drinks but we
haven't done Dr Pepper yet let's see how
this turns out we we' been doing a lot
of the 2 L bottles so this soda bottle
looks extra small today but let's go
ahead and pour this all out into the
pot that was quick Next Step we're going
to need eight packets of unflavored
gelatin We'll pour them in by
twos
two four
six and
eight check out this pile of gelatin
powder all right so grab something to
stir with and we're going to mix this
until all the powder dissolves since
this is a regular soda bottle it
shouldn't take too long like the 2
L okay now let's turn the stove on to
low heat and step away for just a few
minutes
while we wait for the liquid to heat up
let's quickly take off this label from
the
bottle you may want to use an exacto
knife or a pair of scissors to cleanly
rip it off oh quick warning be sure to
ask someone for help if you can't handle
sharp objects don't want you getting
hurt and perfect here's our Dr Pepper
soda label set that aside to use later
let's go back to the bottle and I'll
have to use the xacto knife again to cut
a line right down the
middle and we don't want any liquid
pouring out so let's get a piece of duct
tape and tape it right above the cut oh
just a heads up you still might get a
few small leaks so if you want to place
a napkin under the bottle feel free to
do so wo okay going back to our pot we
had left it right after we turned the
stove on to low heat and it's been
sitting like this for about 5 minutes
make sure you give it a stir every once
in a while and we're going to have to
keep Heating it for another 5 minutes so
let's fast forward all right so after 10
minutes here's how your liquid should
look and you can go ahead and turn the
stove off and let this cool for a bit
after it's cooled you can pour the
liquid back into the bottle so I'll go
ahead and do
that you know how Dr Pepper has 23
flavors I wonder if we'll be able to
taste all the flavors in the gummy
version we'll have to wait and see
okay now let's seal the cat back
on and the boring part we're going to
have to leave this in the fridge
overnight see you tomorrow and we're
back our bottle is nice and cool let's
rip the duct tape
off so far so good grab a pair of
scissors to cut the
plastic all right bear with me while I
rip this plastic off it's not very
entertaining but someone's got to do it
ooh the bottle I'm going to take a wild
guess here and say it's going to feel
like gummy I was right but in all
seriousness seems like the bottle turned
out just fine but we won't really know
until all the plastic is off so let's
keep
tearing oh yeah okay fast forward
whoosh now we just need to take the
bottom and top part off let's start with
the bottom
part and we have to be extremely careful
you don't want any part of the gummy
bottle ripping
off woo
success check this out this looks
exactly like the bottom of a soda
bottle all right now let's move on to
the top portion be careful with this
part
two and
taada here is our perfect Dr Pepper
gummy soda
bottle let's make this super Real by
wrapping the Dr Pepper label we took off
earlier around this gummy bottle
wow I can't believe it this one is
seriously an exact
replica let's add the Final Touch put
the cap on top of the bottle and I think
we could fool anyone that this gummy Dr
Pepper bottle is an actual Dr Pepper
bottle H let me try something I think we
can make it look more real if we have it
stand on its
own steady steady oh oh no our cap okay
we'll get that later Stay Stay
oh come on ah it's not going to work oh
well let's just go ahead and slice up
this gummby soda bottle sit back relax
and enjoy I'll do a taste test in just a
bit
[Music]
woo that's a lot of slicing let's take a
break and do a little taste test
M definitely a hint of Dr Pepper can't
say I tasted all 23 flavors though but
just like with all the other gummy
bottles not as sweet as the actual soda
still pretty good
though well this was a lot of fun thanks
