[Music]
okay so today I'm gonna be cooking some
chicken spaghetti and these are all the
things that you're going to need you're
going to need some
chicken breasts of course normally for
this recipe I would use
you're gonna need some chicken breasts
of course normally for this recipe I
will use a whole chicken but it's
supposed to be a quick and easy recipe
and I ain't got time to be boiling and
de-balling the whole chicken so I'm
gonna rock with this today you're gonna
need a can of chicken broth
some a can of Rotel tomatoes
a can of cream of chicken
a bag of shredded cheese
of course you're gonna need some
spaghetti noodles
and you're gonna need some butter olive
oil or whatever you want to cook your
chicken in
okay guys so I just washed my chicken
and now I'm about to season it with some
salt some pepper and some
some Tony's original some Tony's
original Creole seasoning
okay so I have my chicken all seasoned
up I'm about to go rinse my fingers off
and I'll be right back okay so I have
some butter melted on a medium heat and
I'm going to
cook my chicken
in that
and I have my stove on
a medium Heat
so yeah I'm just gonna let the chicken
cook on a medium heat until it's done
I'm just gonna flip it over so I can
cook it on the other side
okay so while I'm letting the chicken
cook I have
um the pot that I'm gonna blow my
noodles in I have some water filled I
have it filled up with water about
halfway and I'm gonna add my chicken
broth to that
okay then I'm going to turn it on high
and I'm going to bring that to a boil
once it starts boiling I'm going to go
ahead and add my noodles now what the
chicken broth is going to do is it's
gonna add some extra flavor to the
noodles okay so my water and chicken
broth mixture is boiling so I'm about to
go ahead and add the noodles and I'll be
right back I added my noodles to the
water and I also turned my fire down
and I have finished cooking my chicken
breasts and now I'm about to cut it up
so I just got done cutting up all the
chicken and the noodles are just about
done these noodles are done
so I'm about to strain them really
quickly
okay so I just strained the noodles and
I cleaned the pot out the same pot I had
the noodles in and I put the shredded
chicken in this pot over a medium Heat
so now I'm gonna go ahead and add those
little can of Rotel tomatoes and I did
strain this uh I did strain the tomatoes
and then
stir that up
now I'm gonna go ahead and add my can of
cream of chicken
I'm gonna stir that up
[Applause]
I decided to add another can of cream of
chicken
because I didn't like the um
I just wasn't feeling it with one can so
let's see
stir that up
so I'm just mixing this up really really
good and I'm gonna let that
um cook until everything is hot
okay so that's cooking pretty good now
I'm gonna go ahead and add in some
Italian seasoning
and I'm gonna let this
simmer I'm gonna turn the heat down and
I'm just gonna let this simmer for a few
minutes
okay so that's been simmering for a few
minutes so now I'm gonna go ahead and
add half of that bag of cheese in here
and I'm gonna mix that
really good
let the cheese melt into it
[Music]
okay so now the cheese is melted and I'm
gonna go ahead and add my noodles
okay so I added the noodles and um I
added them just a little bit at a time
because I didn't want to put too much in
there and I also put a little bit more a
little bit of Tony's in there
um just because I like my food kind of
spicy but yeah so now I'm about to go
ahead and put this into the baking dish
okay so I just put that into my baking
dish and now I'm just going to
spread it out
evenly
[Music]
they look so good
now I'm gonna take the rest of the
cheese and sprinkle it on top
[Applause]
okay so I already have my oven preheated
to 350 so I'm gonna put this in the oven
and I'm gonna let it bake until the
cheese gets nice and melted all over
okay guys so I just took it out the oven
um the cheese is nice and melted
and they look so good
yeah so I stayed in the oven for about
15 minutes and it's all done
