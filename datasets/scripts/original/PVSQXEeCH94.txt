[Music]
so to make our dinosaur topper we're
going to start with a dowel
about five inches tall
i'm going to add a little bit of
crumpled foil to the dowels
[Applause]
and then i'm just going to tape
[Applause]
now we're just going to give the
aluminum foil a good coat of
marshmallows
and this will just help the rice cereal
treats stick to the structure
all right so now i can take a little bit
of my rice cereal
and just
put that around
and we're going to take some plastic
wrap
just wrap that around
and then you can put this into the
fridge to chill until it's firm so i'm
going to make some kind of cuter eyes
i'm going to go from the largest size
cabochon mold
to the second
to the third
and make two of those
and while those are cooling i'm going to
pour some clear isomalt into my two inch
size two inch
sphere
roll that around
and go ahead and let those cool
all right i'm going to cut out
some more blue little eye transfer
sheets
for the baby dinosaur i'm just going to
torch them so they're a little bit
smooth on top
these are set add a little bit more
isomalt in there
then you put those
pupils right in the middle
make sure it's centered
trim this down a tiny bit
and put a little bit of
edible disco dust
around there just make a little bit
sparkly i'm going to take my transfer
sheet
and just place that over the top
all right now i'm going to go ahead and
torch my
my eyes
gently
to just get rid of those surface bubbles
and i'm going to spray them with some
edible glaze to seal them from getting
cloudy
okay our rice cereal treats are set nice
and hard so now i can start carving out
the shape of the head
actually don't need to do that much
carving
mostly i'm just making sure that each
side is kind of the same
sharp shaving off any hard bumps but
it's pretty much the shape already that
we need it to be
i just want to make sure that the body
is real small because it's gotta fit on
top of the egg
all right i'm gonna place some yellow
fondant on the side
next step
eyebrows
now it looks really weird
all right and then i'm going to
take a small amount come forward down to
the ridge of the nose
i know a lot about dinosaur anatomy now
a piece of modeling chocolate
under the eye which is a little bit hard
to do
from the other side of the cake
i'm going to give them a little bit of a
lower jaw
which really
it's not going to be super defined
because he's a baby
okay so after you get everything
where you want it to be
we're going to go ahead and start
rolling out some fondant and covering
the surface
first i'm just going to put a little bit
of ganache over the
areas where there's no modeling
chocolate so that it will stick
and this this fondant that has a little
bit of ganache on it you can totally
save and re-knead so we want to leave a
little bit
of
eyelid so you're just going to cut
through
and reveal
oh
so cute
i'm just building up the eyelid a little
bit more because i just feel like it was
a little bit too small on the upper eye
then you're going to come over to the
side and cut through both layers of
fondant
and peel off
the first layer
i know you're like oh my gosh now
there's a scene but trust me once we get
everything on you're not going to be
able to tell
my modeling tool to put this little line
back in
i'm so happy to be a dinosaur
all right so now i'm going to use
my
reptile
impression mat from marvelous molds
and i'm just going to put some
impression
in there
just give him some texture
for the nostrils just kind of where this
ridge is right here right in the front
just gonna come in and then push up
add a couple of balls of fondant to the
top
so go ahead and take your 8 inch dome
and tore it in half and i'm filling mine
with white chocolate ganache for
stability and it's going to taste
delicious
just make that nice and smooth
pour in 12 ounces of melted white candy
melts and just put it in there and the
chocolate should kind of smush up the
sides and we're going to pop that into
the freezer for maybe 15 minutes then
take your next layer
of cake and add some ganache in there
drill a hole in the center of your
wooden cake board
take your six inch bolt
washer
washer
locking washer and nut
go ahead and cover the bolts and the
nuts with some aluminum foil tape to
make it food safe
i'm going to roll this out to about
a quarter of an inch
and maybe 10 inches across and now i'm
going to torch the surface with my blow
torch
then i'm going to paint the surface with
some brown edible artist decorative
paint
graham cracker
and cover my cake board with a little
bit of vegetable shortening
it kind of just cracks itself
trim off the excess
i'm gonna go ahead and melt maybe uh two
cups of marshmallows chow mein noodles
and then some slivered almonds
go ahead and take your cake out of the
ball pan
just gonna drill a hole through the
chocolate
another layer of ganache
more cake
so we're just going to crumb coat this
with a layer of
ganache
smooth it out so it's flush with that
chocolate
and then i'm going to place this into
the
freezer just for maybe
10 minutes 5 or 10 minutes just to firm
up that
ganache and then we'll do another layer
all right so to paint our dinosaur baby
i'm gonna use some blue edible
watercolor recipes on the website and i
want it to be pretty light
in color so i'm just gonna dilute it
down and make a big mess all over my
table okay i'm gonna lightly spray the
surface of the fondant with some water
i've got my chlorella cakes airbrush
here and i'm just going to add just a
little bit of yellow this is optional
and you could just use a brush for this
i'm just adding a little bit of yellow
to kind of the middle part of his head
just going to add it so some dimension
so these not just all like blue
paintbrush nice soft watercolor brush
the watercolor should settle pretty
easily down into the crevices
which is what we want it to do
the yellow and get a little bit of green
going on
i'm just going to wipe off some of the
surface
color with a damp paper towel
and that's going to leave the color
behind
it more in the crevices and it's going
to give it a little bit more of a softer
watercolor look
all right so now i'm going to airbrush
some detail with a little bit of sky
blue
you could also
hand paint this if you want into the
crevice of the eyelid
comes out
and you can always add a little bit of
shadow
in between the lines just to give it a
little bit more dimension just don't go
too dark underneath the
mouth a little bit
this little line here it's adding some
shadow
in your nostrils
under the neck a little bit
okay now we're going to come in with
some edible artist paint and just do
some little a little bit of a white line
just around the outside edge
you might have to go over it a couple
times to make it really really white
but we're going with more of like a
watercolor version you know
so now i'm going to take some small
pieces of fondant don't
mind my bright blue hands and i'm just
going to add some teeth going all the
way around
okay i'm rolling out some modeling
chocolate i'm trying to get it long
enough that it'll wrap all the way
around the top of the cake
and then you want to thin down one edge
line
irregular
wrap your chocolate
and just kind of make sure your
your uh you know sides slope up
with the shape of the egg
i'm going to airbrush the inside of the
egg
just for fun just for contrast you know
so it's not just all like
white white on white on white a little
dimension on the inside of this egg
the sides of our egg are a little bit uh
flat
i'm just going to build it up with some
more ganache
acetate smoother blending this seam
between the chocolate
and the ganache and just going straight
up
cover the base of the board real quick
here all right i'm just going to
speckle the surface a little bit
a little bit of brown
cannot forget straws
for support because this is a really
heavy cake
put those in there you probably need
like five
and then place your dino
i'm just going to use my little modeling
tool here to put in some
cracks
make a little zigzag mark
this looks a little too symmetrical so
i'm going to just add another little
crack there
another one maybe down there
