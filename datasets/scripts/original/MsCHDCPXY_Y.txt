be showing you guys how to make some p
and I have already started on some of
the stuff so let me show you guys so
here I already have the Chile ready um I
have Chile New
Mexico chile the
adal um Chile
negro and um Chile California so those
are the only chilies I have in there and
I also put a glove of garlic in there
and over here in this one I have the
meat with some onion a whole onion and
also another glove of garlic and what
I'm going to get to right now is
blending the
Chile and pouring it in here and then I
will put
the
homon in there and we will let it
cook okay so as you guys seen I started
blending it so I'm going to go ahead and
let it blend a little
more so I'm done blending it now what
I'm going to do I'm going to pour it in
here but I don't want the seeds so I'm
going to be putting it in here and
moving it
okay so I have it here already so I'm
going to start moving it so it'll all
the Chile could just fall
in okay so you guys see how all the
seeds are right there we don't want that
inside okay so there we have it all the
seeds are there those are going to go in
the trash and there is our
Chile okay so the next step is putting
in our homon and what I just did I
opened it already I'm going to drain all
that water and wash it real
good okay
so you see there I'm just throwing all
that dirty water and I'm going to be
rinsing it with clean
water okay so I'm going to start
cleaning
it okay so that's our first can now I'm
going to
open our second one and we'll be
repeating the same steps as the first
one so I'm going to be draining the
water cleaning it out and then putting
it in
here okay so I have already poured the
second one and this is how it's looking
you
guys so we don't have no chili skin in

going to let it there and
steam and once it's finished finished we
will surf
ourselves but for now what I'm going to
do I'm going to cut some onion and some
C okay so now I'm going to start cutting
my cabbage and then I'll get to my so I
cut my cabbage already and I cut it in
half so I'm going to start off with this
first
half okay so I'm going to start peeling
off the
skin so I could get to cut cutting
it okay so there we have it our onion so
