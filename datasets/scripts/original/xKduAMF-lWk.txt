okay you saw me Harvest them or saw my
plants so what I did was I cut off some
of the lower
leaves and some of the bad leaves that
the bugs had gotten and I used a skirt
hanger and uh I'm drying my
leaves and I'm drying them in the house
because I think the humidity here is the
best look at those leaves and these are
the small leaves ain't that beautiful so
let's see how the tobacco
goes okay this is the second way I'm
trying to dry my tobacco what I did was
I took just a string doubled with a
needle on the end and I threaded it
through the stems of each tobacco leaf
so that they're apart from each other
seems to be drying really
well very pleased with that it's not
crinkly it's
uh you know it's soft and supple see
that um and then I put it in my
humidifier all right after about 2 weeks
it
feels kind of
like leather really thin
leather some of it's sticky some of it's
not and what I've got here is I've got a
humidor that I bought to go with my
tobacco and you can get that at Fresh
Choice tobacco.com so now what I'm doing
is pulling stems off center
ribs and if it's dry enough you'll know
they come off really good and it doesn't
stick to your fingers if it's not dry
enough see if I've got one in
here um it sticks to your
fingers okay so that one could probably
hang a little longer but I think it's
going to be okay in the
humidor smells like tobacco
almost and so I'm going to strip the
stems off while I can cuz I ain't
smoking no stems
and
uh we're going to leave it in humidor um
I do have humidor liquid in here and it
is maintaining probably about
uh 60 right now I'm going to leave it
open and
uh let some of the more moisture come
out of
these I think now with the center Vine
out they'll the moisture will come out
really
quickly so probably tomorrow I'll close
it cuz like this one is really wet you
can tell it's it's sticks to my fingers
whereas the dry
ones don't but yet I can crumble them
up and open them right back up so they
aren't
brittle pretty cool it's just really
cool all
right let's let it keep
drying then I put it in my Shredder or
you can just put it in your water if you
want to make some insect repellent with
it and then I shred it
up I have it currently in Ziplocs
because I'm doing some flavored tobacco
for my
friends and then I take it put it in the
tobacco machine sorry just finished it's
a mess and I roll
cigarettes and then true to Fashion as
the canning Queen I store them in a
canning jar so they stay fresh and there
you go that's how you do
tobacco I'm learning I'll let you know
as I learn new things
blessings all right so let me try to
answer some of your questions what can
you use to back of forth so I kind of
looked up some things on the internet
now I don't know how true some of these
things are but
in the 19th century Stuart G found some
exceptional uses for
tobacco if it's administered externally
bites of poisonous reptiles and insects
hysteria
pain neuralgia lingal spasms gout growth
of hair tetanus ringworm rodent ulcer
ulcers wounds respiratory
stimulant I like the idea of a
respiratory stimulant tobacco
administered by rectum constipation
hemorrhoidal bleeding of course it
constricts the blood vessels so yes that
would make sense administered by mouth
strangulated hernia so you blow smoke
into someone's
mouth malaria or intermittent fever
dislodging obstructed material because
it would once again constrict the blood
vessels and it also can induce
vomiting administered by
inhalation nasal
pols now I found some other interesting
things that um researchers at the
University of
Louisiana have discovered anti-cancer
compounds in tobacco leaves now when
they're talking about what they've
discovered on the surface of the
tobacco there is a um like a waxy
substance it makes it t touch and feel
really soft they're trying to find a way
to harness that waxy substance because
that has anti-cancer
[Applause]
agents um there is a new therapeutic
made from tobacco plants that is shown
to arrest West Nile Virus Infection
again the waxy substance on the
outside of the
[Applause]
leaf
um they're showing that it has a
protective effect against neurod
degenerative
disorders so when we say
neurodegenerative
disorders they're finding that
um alleviates symptoms of mental illness
including anxiety and
schizophrenia that would kind of be a
great thing to know if shtf were to
happen especially when in about 90 days
everyone's psychiatric medicines start
to wear
off it also has found that Parkinson's
disease and Alzheimer's disease is lower
in
smokers than
non-smokers in the 18th 17th and 16th
centuries they used to use tobacco
leaves for making
torches to ward off disease and fatigue
they would burn the Torches and the
aroma would give you more energy and uh
they said that what they found didn't
actually ward off disease but people who
smoke seem to have a higher resistance
to to disease because they've
already um taxed their immune system
whereas those that don't smoke haven't
taxed their immune system and so when
they get hit with is something it tends
to hit them much
harder um it's used as an
anesthetic if you mix it with lime or
chalk it can be a
toothpaste breathing the odor of fresh
green leaves of the plant relieves
persistent headaches again restricting
the vessels in the
brain for cold green powder leaves
should be rubbed around the inside of
mouth uh it can be used to heal wounds
and burns it is also a good metal polish
and as I've said before it makes a great
um bug spray take the leaves and steep
them in water and that removes the
nicotine bottle it and put it on your
plants bugs don't like
it so I hope this helps answer the
questions I know they're going to
come
[Applause]
