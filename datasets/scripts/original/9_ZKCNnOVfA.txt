first thing you want to do when ordering
an easy care fit kit is pick up the
horse's
foot and you're getting a measurement
before you even order so we're about 116
mm
wide and tot to heel we're
roughly it's about the same 116 116 this
horse has a pretty round foot So based
on the 116 width you're going to get a a
size one fit
kit size one fit kit will come with
three different shells you'll get the
size one you'll get a size larger which
is a 1.5 and you'll get a .5 on the
small
side ideally the the one is going to fit
true based on the sizing so you want to
try your one
first slides on the
Huff it's nice and tight and what you
want to look for is any gaps
in the hoof wall you can see we have a
really nice fit all the way around the v
in the front of the shell has spread
open and we have a really nice fit all
the way around the boot no gaps in the
heel area so one size one is a is a nice
fit on this
horse the fit kit
um we show you if any of the other boots
are a better size so I'll put this one
back going down to the .5
the at point5 will still go on this foot
but what we're seeing here is we're
starting to see the
foot overlap the side of the boots this
boot would still work and that kind of
shows you how well the the shell on the
easy boot glue on
flexes still have a nice fit on the on
the sides the front V is
spread still a nice fit but where're the
hoof is over the sides of the base that
that one is too
small it's nice and tight go to the size
larger this is a
1.5 you can see this one also fits nice
but we're we're seeing a little twisting
here and we're also seeing a little more
Gap in the heel
area
but we still have a nice fit around
sides of the walls the v in the front is
still spreading nicely and that boot
would actually still work in a glue on
situation it wouldn't work as well as a
glove so we're a little big
here so based on those three shells the
one would fit this horse
best go back to size one real
quick
real tight from side to side boots hard
to get off snug in the heel
area so based on that fit kit um sizing
we'd order a size one in a glue on shell
or an easy boot glove
