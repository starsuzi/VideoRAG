well i'm back from the oakwood jungle
and uh gonna get ready to make some
pickled ochre and i thought i'd show you
guys how to
how i make it so uh
gotta get a couple other things set up
and then we'll get started
okay i've got my water bath candle
just preheating i have i don't have
enough lemon juice to
make a full canner full
and uh mine holds seven quarts
and so i just have um those two jars
there filled with water just to take up
the space so that
the jars won't jiggle together and crack
so let me show you what i've got here
all right get everything fixed so you
can see what i'm doing here
all right i have these four quarts
pretty much ready
everything's in it and this one i'm
going to
show you now i've i've never used the
onion in it before but i'm going to try
just took an onion about that size and
cut it in five pieces and chopped it up
in large chunks
and the the garlic you can see that's
probably
maybe a tablespoon and a half and i
leave it in pretty good sized chunks
so each each jar has a third to
a half cup of lemon juice and i
like i said i didn't i thought i had
more lemon juice but i i didn't
so just put the lemon juice and the
garlic
down in there and then the onion add to
it
and then when you pack the okra in
if you've made fuel pickles you know you
kind of have to pack them in
real tight and for the pickled ochre the
larger
pieces actually do better they they
taste really
really nice um
but if you've never had okra raw
whenever i go to pickle
i pick several that are about that size
just you know
you know maybe pinky size for me they're
delicious rock you've never had it raw
you've got to try it
the smaller pieces are better for that
but you can still eat these too
but i prefer the smaller pieces so
um i just start packing it in i just
kind of line them up
and pack them in full and you want to
squeeze it just as tight as you can in
there get them in
nice and snug i've got them all washed
up and
ready to go the uh
neighbor who's letting me pick this i
call it the okra jungle
i've never seen oka plants so tall the
things must be 10 feet tall
and usually my husband helps me pick but
he's not here right now so
i had to go and pick today and
i just have to bend the plants over and
cut the fruit sets on the top
so i have to reach it that way
i also add uh you can see on these that
i've got some seasonings in here
besides the um
the chopped garlic and chopped onion
i put about a teaspoon of dill weed
dried dill weed and or you can use fresh
if you have it
i don't have any so you got to really
smoosh them down in there because you've
got spaces
down in here and i don't want to waste
any space i want all the okra in here
that i can get
so anyway so about a teaspoon of uh
dill a heaping teaspoon and i use the
pink salt i don't use cannon salt i
think that's
i don't think it's good for you and the
pink salt the himalayan
or even the celtic work fine i've never
had any problem they do
you know cause a little bit of
cloudiness but i don't care
about that so anyway
just pack in all the spaces so a
teaspoon of dill a heaping teaspoon of
pink or celtic salt
depending on your salt palette uh
a third to a quarter cup of lemon juice
and uh i'm using a little bit i like a
little bite to my
pickled okra so i i put uh cayenne i'm
using
in in this recipe i'm going to use the
90 000. don't ever use
9 less than 90 000 in fact you should
never buy anything less than 90
000 heat units i've got some that's 160
uh heat unit 160 000 hit units but
it's packed somewhere in the sea of
boxes
so anyway yeah just really pack them in
there
um and the cayenne
i really don't know how much i put in
there i know it's probably less than uh
more than a pinch and less than eight
teaspoons so it's just kind of according
to your
your heat palette how much you put in
there
the little bitty pieces uh they work
real well when you get to the top here
and you can't get any more of the big
ones and you can smoosh in a few more of
those
little niblets i call them
i really wish that i had more lemon
juice because uh
i got plenty of okra here to do a full
canner but
i don't want to take time to go all the
way to town in just like
30 minutes one way
so get it all smooshed in there good
i got my lids warm here this this is
what we call cold pack
and most of time whenever you preserve
vegetables like this you want to use a
pressure canner
but because the lemon juice is acidic it
will do fine and the water bath can't
cater and if you if you over process
these they're going to turn out limp and
mush and not
not have any crispiness to them and you
probably won't like them especially
if you already have issue with the
swanny nature of oprah
okay that's uh
pretty smooshed in there i think i can
get one more in that spot
so anyway i've got my lids warm
and i do have the water bath candle
kettle
i already have some water in there and i
have it on low
just so that it could begin to get warm
i don't put the jars in there obviously
with
with the water hot or they would they
would crack
but i do warm it so see about
that's probably a teaspoon and a half
it's just really rounded up
and this the himalayan is
a wet salt because the magnesium in it
by the way i uh i cut my finger
picking okra and the cayenne it will
stop the bleeding on that
okay uh here goes with the cayenne you
see how much i've got in there not much
and i i probably won't put all that in
there i don't know
just kind of eyeball it
okay now uh let me get my water
i've got the lemon juice and everything
is in here now i just
fill up the rest with
this water leave a little head space at
the top
and just start putting on my lids
that one's sticking up i'm gonna have to
smush him a little bit
maybe all right just give them a little
twist
by the way i don't i don't like these
skinny cannon jars you can't pack as
many
in there but use what i could dig out of
storage
all right one more
all right let's load up the canner and
turn this on the process
now um with the water bath camera
you want the water i don't i don't think
you can see this let me bring the camera
over
um you can see how the water is not up
to the top of the jars there
so i'm just going to fill it up so that
it's right up you know to the top and
maybe even cover just a little bit and
i'm going to bring this to a boil once
it comes to a boil i start timing
20 minutes and once that 20 minutes is
done
i'll remove the the jars from the canner
and i'll show you that
whenever we get through to that part
20 minutes and counting
okay tom's up always remember when you
open these to open it away from me
because
the steam will get you
my handy-dandy grabber
turn these out and set them here
i haven't had any problem with any of
these sealing
and uh they do
just fine i have to give the uh
shout out to my friend suzanne who
um shared with me this method i
always made the brine and did this hot
pack instead of cold pack
and doing it call pack and just putting
it in the individual jars really saves a
lot of time
the recipe is mine but the idea to do it
cold pack and just put everything right
in the
in the jar was hers so i really
appreciate that i'll just let this cool
down a little bit
and uh we'll let these seal and if you
don't know
they'll make a little popping noise when
they and they seal
but you can see they're they're boiling
in there
and see what they taste like
so that's it that's pickled okra
before i quit i did want to mention that
if you have a problem with the slime
in ochre this is one way that helps
because it's not
slimy like this so it's a good way to
try i can't wait for my husband to try
it
i don't think he's ever had pickled okra
before
