right here we have a bad dog I don't
know if you can tell but on my deck it's
not supposed to have bits and pieces of
lattice and big gaping holes there's
supposed to be lattice there this one
figured out that the best way out of the
fenced area was
through the deck and so he started
pulling the lattice off and I replaced
the wood lattice with plastic lattice
but that's the only piece of plastic
lattice left because he chewed that up
too so while I'm waiting on my steam
engine to boil and uh get started I
figured I'd come out here and show you
some Ingenuity that we've done to try to
fix this welded
wire what we did is we cut out some
welded wire and then used the staple gun
and stapled it in there I'm going to
have to come come back and put some
molding up around it to make it
prettier but he can't get in there with
his teeth to pull that out and he's not
going to chew it um unfortunately it's
rather expensive and the roll that I got
only did the main uh exits I'm going to
have to get another couple rolls and do
everything else to make it not look um
trashy but uh anyway I just thought that
was neat and it was pretty effective
he's had to find him a new way to
escape he's
cute he's
nice but he's dumb as a box of
rocks and uh doesn't
know how to quit he'd stay in a lot less
trouble if he didn't get out the fence
but anyway old Bear's a pretty good
boy so I'm going to go back in and check
my pressure boiler cuz you don't want to
leave that
sitting
a I'm getting ready to
