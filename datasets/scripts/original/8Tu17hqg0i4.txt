hey what's up everybody this is Paul you
Jr again and today we're going to show
you a very simple method uh to get
decals off glass windows uh any glass
whatsoever but today I'll be doing uh my
car and as you can see it just says air
it did say repair and everything else is
off and this is all you're going to need
a little bottle of Windex
sponge
and a heat gun or a blow dryer we'll
also do the trick and I'm going to do my
best here to do everything with one hand
and keep it as steady as possible so
let's just go right into it so
now you really
the biggest thing right here so with the
letter we're going to start with the
letter A all we really need to do is
just catch a point where we're going to
be able to get underneath this you don't
need a scraper or anything like that so
all I'm going to do is go right at the
bottom of the a
right there and heat that up the most
and that should do it I'll give a little
bit of heat to everything else but
mostly to the a right there
put this down
and all I'm gonna do just grab my finger
or grab the letter with my finger
as much as I possibly can
and there might be some times where I
have to put on more heat but as long as
I can grab it like so
that's all I need
it's not even necessary to heat up the
rest
and
this is literally a simple as it gets so
there's one letter down so to save time
I'm going to
just get the the residue off of the A
and that's it
so
we're just going to spray the a
right there
and we're going to grab our sponge
you know you need something with a
little bit of grit
and this has it and you'll feel it
the residue start to
start to go away a little bit
and you may need to do it uh
you'll see like an imprint
and it's going to be really really light
after this it may not even be there but
after like a car wash or two everything
will be gone so I'm not really feeling
any more grit here
so I'm going to stop that put that down
go over to my handy dandy hose
make this nice and simple
um
get my heat gun out of the way
and that's hot so I'm going to keep that
like I said you can use a blow dryer too
because this isn't that this isn't that
serious
and
I'm gonna go right there
a lot of big
after that
we're gonna dry it up
a little bit
that's what I was saying you can
kind of maybe not in this reflection you
can't really see it but it'll be like
vaguely there just because it's been
sitting there for so long it's like when
you leave something uh on the carpet for
so long it leaves an imprint but
eventually does go away
and that's it so just a little bit of
heat and
a little bit of a nail
and we're gonna call it so thanks for
watching another simple uh
step-by-step tutorial and have a great
day guys see ya
