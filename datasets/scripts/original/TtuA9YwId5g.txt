hi there I'm Matt Kemp from London's the
underground cookery school and today I'm
going to show you some simple recipes
which you're going to
love hi there I'm going to show you how
to braze uh which is incredibly simple
brazing really is slow cooking and I can
think of Nothing Better To Bra than a l
shamp what I've got is a pan on the go
here and I've just put some olive oil in
there and I'm just going to add this is
more just for a bit of extra flavor just
got some
onion just a few diced carrots or
chopped carrots rather I've got some uh
th and a bay leaf um it'd be quite nice
if I had any Rosemary knocking around
cuz I'm doing lamb and the combination
is really good I've got my lamb shank
here so that's going to go in the pan as
well I've got some stock here just going
to take that off the boil and I'm going
to
cover the ingredients with that
stock if you just come in and have a
look it's almost covered but not quite
so I'm just going to finish the job off
so now those ingredients are completely
covered ordinarily you would have a lid
to your pan but I don't so I'm just
going to put some Tim foil over the top
um if you haven't got Tim 4 fly enough I
know it sounds a bit peuli but you can
actually use
um cling film or even a damp tea tow but
if you do use a tea toil just make sure
that um the ends are aren't sort of
Dripping over the side or hanging over
the side I should say cuz obviously
they'll catch a light that's going to go
back on the hole just bring that up to
um a gentle simmer and I'll then
transfer that pan or we'll do it
together um into the oven and from that
point onwards um you're going to cook or
or let's use the term that we using here
braze um that shank for probably about
an hour and a half um just to reiterate
really all brazing is is is slow cooking
um with liquid um preferably aop um in
the
oven well that's um bubbling away quite
nicely it's on a gentle simmer so I'm
going to take that off the hob um and
that simply will now go in the
oven for about an hour and a
half and when that comes out it will be
beautifully brazed that's uh obviously
now been in there for fair probably a
bit longer actually 2
hours so AB it comes and that as you can
see it's beautifully
brazed
oops out properly now just to emphasize
the point what I'm going to
do is there it just falls off the bone
which is exactly what you want that's
beautifully
brazed um and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to I'm going to just um slice
this up add some of the veg and the
cooking juices in this dish um just for
the finishing shot um but now you know
how to braid it's just um putting meat
um in um liquid bringing it up to the
boil finishing it off in the oven with a
cover on letting it slow cook for
hours at a time but that's how
sprays
