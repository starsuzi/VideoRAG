doing
um
playing vigor
we put vinegar in and
then
egg uh-huh and what is it gonna do
it's gonna
break your gel off but it's gonna
still
be like a cell like a shell it's gonna
be in the same shape as an egg and then
what can the egg do
it can melt it can bounce huh
so there's our vinegar there's our egg
shall we see
and there it is
we submerged it in vinegar and is it big
yeah it's kind of a big egg
and how many days do we have to wait oh
two days two days we're gonna wait two
days and then see what happens
here's our egg and vinegar experiment
uh do you know why that works torn why
so
the vinegar has acetic acid in it
and
the shell
oh don't eat it yucky
gross
the shell has calcium carbonate in it
and when those two interact
it eats away the shell and turns it into
carbon dioxide which is the same gas
that we breathe out
so
it's slowly eating it away
and the shell is going to just disappear
oh yeah
yeah it touches soft and look the egg is
kind of changing colors a little bit
would be soft soft soft because we don't
want to break the egg
so probably in another day that egg will
be ready and then we can pull it out and
see if it we're not going to eat it what
are we going to do with it
um
make it bounce we're going to bounce
that egg
so here's our egg that we put in vinegar
and torn is going to pull it out and
we're going to see what it looks like
okay go ahead and reach in really
careful
yeah really careful
you're gonna have to use more than two
fingers i think
just pick it up oh
careful yeah put it on here
okay go wash your hands
and the shell is gone
question is is it gonna bounce
okay let it go let's see
it bounces it's a bouncy egg yeah okay
but we gotta be careful we don't want to
drop it really high
because it'll still smash
what do you think do you like your cool
new egg
yeah is that cool
smell it what does it smell like
i like vinegar
what does it feel like
feels bouncy does it feel like a bouncy
ball yeah it feels heavy too is it heavy
yeah
cool
i didn't know an it could
bounce if you
put an egg in vinegar
i didn't know it can bounce i know
that's pretty cool huh
hey bring it back over here
