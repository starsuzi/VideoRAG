hey everybody Dave from Red vacation
here today I wanted to talk about
different ways that I like to use the
whammy bar sometimes I like to color
chords with it other times I like to use
it for single note lines to give a
different texture so let's take a
[Music]
look so the chords I'm using here are
different inversions of minor major 7
chords going from a G minor key
to a D minor key so the first chord
here root position G minor major 7 and
then I'm playing it from the
seventh root position D Minor major 7th
chord and then
again the seventh and this higher
voicing as well so I go to a from a high
to a lower voicing to a low to a high
and I'm playing the
[Music]
chord I'm giving it the first two chords
just a little
shake with the whammy bar just to give
it a little warble and then for the
second two chords I'm actually dumping
the bar down so this
chord is Out Of
Tune and then I bring it up to
pitch and use the whammy bar with a
wider vibr and then for the second
chord I'm I'm double dipping so it
really gives this cool warbly sound uh
to the chord
[Music]
so for this example I'm moving up in the
constant structure and uh what the base
motion is
implying is a g sus to G major a sus a
major B sus B major and then C Shar sus
uh C major and I'm not picking any of
these little two note di that I'm
playing I'm hammering on
while the bar is dipped down so again
it's an Out Of Tune sound that comes
back up to pitch
[Music]
so creates a really really cool texture
over that you know cord motion that's
happening underneath it um the trick
with this is you really want to hammer
on good and
hard so that way both notes ring out
otherwise you're going to get a little
bit of a thinner sound so the whole um
approach with this is hammering on that
double
[Music]
stop so you get some overtones and
harmonics of both those notes ringing
out together and being Out Of Tune and
then coming into the right
[Music]
pitch so here I'm using the bar with
some single note lines and I'm dipping
down on the first note and the last out
and I'm just moving up in a whole tone
scale
[Music]
so it just gives the line a little bit
more of like an otherworldly character
especially when you have a little bit of
delay on there so here's a real life
application of this technique I use it
in a Solo section for a song called
monolithic ignorance so I'm going to
play the chords first and then I'll show
you uh the technique that I'm using
[Music]
so here's the chords to the solo section
uh it's an FSH Minor
7 and then it goes to like an F minor 13
sound and minor
6 then D major 7 to D major 7 with a
nine right I'm just taking this
off and then B minor 7 and then that
goes to another nine Sound and all this
uh this whole riff is in 5'4 so you're
feeling the punctuation
[Music]
as the strong five pulse so the way I
initiate the lick is this really big
stretch here and I'm dipping the bar
[Music]
down so I'm accentuating that five feel
without picking anything it's all the
attack is coming from the bar and like
really really strong hammer on so it can
be tricky especially when you have this
big uh you know stretch here from the
the ninth fret all the way up to the
16th fret so really have to have a you
know a good hammer on
there and then I'm going down
accentuating the
[Music]
chords that's basically like a D major 7
Dyan
[Music]
sound all with the bar and then finally
over the B
minor so that
slide and then giving a little vibr at
the end there um how you how I'm feeling
that that initial lick it's it's in five
but I'm breaking it up into different
pieces so it's like one two 3 one two
one two one two three so that's you know
three and two five and then two and
three is five um so it's all a five feel
but I'm breaking it into different
subdivisions of that beat to push the
Rhythm forward in interesting ways so I
hope you guys enjoyed this series of
lessons uh I always love coming to the
Guitar World and teaching for you guys
um pick up the new record great as our
sin when it comes out helps support us
and uh I hope you have a lot of fun with
these techniques and I hope they bring a
new dimension to your playing so thanks
a lot and see you on the road
