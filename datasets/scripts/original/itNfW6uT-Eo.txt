I got half cup of half cup of lukewarm
water into which I'm adding two
teaspoons of sugar
give it a stir and then add half a
sachet of instant yeast just to get half
associate
I've just folded the sachet into and
taken just the whole
stay girl and you may leave it for 10 to
15 minutes for it to rise
measure two little cups of rice flour
and that I'm adding half a cup of plain
flour plain flour
next you have one tin of coconut milk
stir it well put it in a jug
and microwave it under just lukewarm and
the milk is warm enough to take on the
yeast you can see starting to bubble
I've got 400 ml of warmed up coconut
milk into which I am going to add 200 ml
of water the reason then if the coconut
milk is too thick and it's still on
toilet the purpose can come up and you
may actually turn so we don't have a
very good coconut oil but they pick me
using a little whisk I'm adding two
coconut milk to the flour
I woke up just once it's telling us how
scary the story and see whether the
spawn gets quartered fairly thick that
should be about the right consistency
you can now see the yeast is nicely
risen and you add it to the mixture stir
it further
can cover this little bit of film at
leave it in the land place price just
make sure the bail is big enough for it
to rise probably about an inch I have
not added the salt because the salt has
to be and asked as the yeast will not
stopped to help the plowed rice if you
add that salt right now
the puppet has nicely risen you can see
the bubbles in it so to get this I
suggest that you put your batter in the
warmest place in the house which could
be if you have a warming drawer or if
you have a airing cupboard which is more
heat than the rest of the house
that would be nice and now it's almost
ready to make the hot purse but I am
adding the salt only now I didn't tell
it earlier because he can stop the
better fun rising so roughly about
approximately 1 and huh
teaspoons of salt
and if you like you can just distinct to
see
yep that's fine so it's all ready to be
supposed to be baked now you put the
hopper pan on the fire
a medium heat
to court because then the better tends
to come
you can see the consistency because when
you go it is not too thick it's not too
watery
but just
my poetic double cream unlived double
cream Desa texture
just test whether the pan is hot enough
just to put a few drops in it and if it
doesn't make the crispy mice a little
bit longer
hopefully should be key
with the later
but spoonful
turn it around
and did on fire and to see people eat
probably look like this half into the
baking process and you need each other
probably will take two minutes to flip
so it will be a good idea for a more
than one hand
you can see the hooker with just nicely
browned and at this stage it should just
come off the pan you actually do need or
you can just write it down see okay and
let the pan just cool down for about 30
seconds before you put the next time
because if it is too hot the better you
come off the edges if that happens just
put it aside and put the batter again
so I'm going to do another one now
if you want thick centers you can put a
little bit of extra pattern if you want
the puppetry thing all the way through
just put about
three quarters of the later
because it happen I step down and it's
yummy with my jam
Drako covering anything with its very
first our food I'm going to now show you
how to do an egg hope you don't put as
much better you can put a little bit
less
give it a twirl
and you break the egg - the same and
keep it covered and reduce the heat
as the igneous a bit of cooking my house
off top of you once sent to me you can
take it off the fire
I put something like this
the show quickly bubbles over here
maybe put my books
as you can see it's nicely cooked now
and you can sprinkle some salt and
pepper finish to where you can add a bit
of gravy to the top
we don't need to pay the rest of
brainpower thank you hope you enjoy the
