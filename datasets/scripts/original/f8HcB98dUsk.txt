greetings lovelies hi it's emmy welcome
back so today i'm going to share with
you my recipe for chicken enchiladas
really simple recipe that i make on a
weeknight i should mention this is not a
traditional mexican style enchilada it's
a tex-mex kind of recipe i don't know i
made up the recipe and we love it here
and i love it and i would say the
flavors are definitely not authentic so
if you're looking for authentic mexican
enchiladas this is definitely not it all
right enough blabbing let's go into the
kitchen and i'll show you how i made it
so take an eight ounce block of cheese
and grate it i'm using combination of
extra sharp and colby pour the shredded
cheese into a bowl and save a little bit
for garnish
next you're going to finally mince some
bell pepper you can use red or green
and then add a quarter cup of that to
your cheese
finely mince some onion and add 1 4 cup
to your bell pepper and cheese mixture
then we're going to finish off the
filling by adding some chopped cooked
chicken
so we're going to moisten up the mixture
by adding a couple teaspoons of
store-bought enchilada sauce give
everything a good mix
next we're just going to put everything
together so in a shallow pan add the
rest of your enchilada sauce and warm
this up on low
put a little sauce in the bottom of your
pan so your enchiladas won't stick
dip your corn tortilla into the warmed
up sauce and then place that onto a
plate then add a generous amount of your
stuffing and just roll it up
then place enchilada into your saucepan
and just fill it up until you run out of
stuffing once you get everything rolled
up then pour the remaining sauce on top
of your enchiladas and top with the last
of your shredded cheese
cover with foil and bake in a 350 degree
oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until the
center gets all melty and bubbly
so after 30 40 minutes remove the foil
and then turn your oven onto broil and
then you're gonna broil the cheese on
top so it gets nice and crusty and
bubbly
then i like to garnish it with a little
bit of cilantro
so this is how i like to serve it i like
to make a little bed of shredded iceberg
lettuce and i like to add a little bit
of arugula too because it gives a little
bit of pepperiness and a little bit of
green to kind of brightens things up
then top it with a generous scoop of
your enchiladas
some homemade salsa i'll put the link
down the description box if you haven't
seen that recipe
and then some guacamole and if you like
a little bit of sour cream
and there you have a thing of beauty
enjoy
all right
so good
i love this recipe part of the reason
why i love it so much is because of all
the additions i add to it i think alone
it would be just too heavy and cheesy
for me but then with the lettuce and the
avocado and the salsa
i usually have some i'll serve it with
tortilla chips
it becomes more of a salad
and it's just delicious and fresh i
always squeeze a little bit of lime
juice on top because it brightens
everything up and kind of cuts the
heaviness of the cheese
and it makes me very happy
it makes great leftovers as well it
freezes well
and great to take as a potluck too
because you can just warm it up in an
oven so yeah that's my chicken enchilada
dish i hope you guys try it it's really
one of my favorite recipes and yeah let
me know in the comments below what you
guys think if you do try it all right
thanks you guys for watching and i'll
see you in my next video
toodaloo take care bye
look
how adorable that filling is oh my
goodness so stinking cute it's half
white and half chocolate so they're like
little truffles and the filling is
actually quite similar to the bambina
here's my impression of a disingenuously
over concerned ant
which also could pass for a highly
constipated person
