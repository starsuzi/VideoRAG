hi drastic cuties today we're going to
draw a cup of white chocolate mocha from
starbucks so let's get started
to draw this yummy drink from starbucks
we're going to first start by drawing a
straight line for the top of the cup so
i'm going to come right here just go
ahead and draw a straight line right
across
[Music]
about that wide and then from there i'm
going to come to the
where i started
and end it and just round it off and
bring an angle lying down for my
cup so i'm going to do both sides slowly
build it all the way down
just makes it a little bit easier to see
as you go
and keep bringing it down so just a
small little cup
i saw this image from starbucks and i
had to draw it for you because it was so
cute it looked so yummy to celebrate
fall winter
so about right there
i'll stop it round off the bottom
and i'm just going to go ahead and
connect it with a very soft curve
all the way across
there so then from there let's come back
in here and i'm going to basically
follow my outside line
because it is a glass it is glass so
this way it makes it look like the drink
is inside a glass
so i'm just going to go all the way
oops
[Music]
and towards the bottom once again
[Music]
and connect it
okay so i have my cup in now now let's
come up and draw the yummy
whipped cream so if you want to follow
exactly what i'm doing
in terms of the whipped cream shape
first you would start right here you're
going to draw one little dollop right
here so come up
just draw a soft curve
and
bring it in
just kind of taper it in
then the second one is right here
twist this side now we're going to draw
a curve
and bring this part in
and then from there we're going to come
to right here and we're going to draw a
curve so basically we're just building
up this dollop so but right here i draw
a curve that comes up
[Music]
about that much
and then i'm going to aim to drop the
biggest dollop so we're going to end
about right here so i'm going to go up
see about right there and then from
there i'm going to start to bring it in
so just curve it
comes out
and one more
another curve
okay so then from there let's make this
a little bit
softer curve
okay so then from there to build it into
a dollop let's come let's see here let's
come to the first line which is this one
right here where this edge is and we're
just gonna come and build a curve
all the way down
soften this up
and then right there then from there
we're gonna come and build this dollop
right now on this edge and we're just
gonna bring this all the way up
so that way all our curves make sense
and i'm just going to build it up
oops all the way up
there so i have my nice little mount
okay so then from there i'm gonna
lightly come in here just give it some
more curves
some more details so these are gonna be
lighter lines
and in here so this part right here i'm
going to bring a lighter line
in
and one more
[Music]
there
nice and yummy now right and then i'm
going to come in there later and do the
sprinkles of a thinner sharpie but from
there now let's draw our um part right
here where the cream goes into the mocha
so about right here i'm just going to
draw a wavy line
and go back up
and then
stop right there and then from there i'm
going to draw eyes if you want to bring
this drink to life so about right here
i'm just going to add
a circle for some drawsecute eyes
and another one
and let's make them drastic cute eyes so
i'm going to put two small circles in
here for highlights
and a curved line at the bottom and
shade in the top
thank you guys for loving all my
starbucks drawings over the years if
you've been following me you know i love
starbucks
[Laughter]
it's my favorite place to go to get
drinks
and lines at the bottom right oh i mean
circles
so make sure if you love starbucks like
i do to check out my starbucks drinks
playlist
and the lines at the bottom
okay so then from there let's come to
the top right here we're just going to
draw a light curve above each eye and in
between the eyes right here just draw a
soft curve for a sweet smile and cap it
off
and if you want i'm going to add some of
these hands i usually put on my drinks
that comes to a little heart shape so
about right here
i'll start and bring a curve in
to the right
there
so same thing on this i'm going to drag
my point across about right there
once again curve and bring it all the
way
so then about right there i'm going to
stop and add
this heart shape
[Music]
and connect it back
[Music]
so now basically the drink is done i'm
going to come back in here with a
thinner sharpie and draw the sprinkles
so there's some brown
white sprinkles and then there's a lot
of
red sugar sprinkles so i'll just start
with the circle ones first maybe some
half ones here and there
[Music]
you can add as many as little sprinkles
as you want
okay so then for the sugar ones
they're more
rectangularish so
however many you want to add
[Music]
just make them at different angles
when you're
drawing them
[Music]
[Music]
let's see here
i think i'll end it about right there
and then right here where the whipped
cream meets the drink um you're gonna
see some swirls so
you can do that when you're coloring but
i just want to show you
just add some darks and lights so you
can see
the swirls
and the drink
[Music]

yummy white chocolate mocha from
starbucks to celebrate fall and winter
