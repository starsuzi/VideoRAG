hey everyone we're having a nice little
barbecue cookout today because it's a
gorgeous day out so for that I'm going
to make my artichoke dip which is so
easy and it's so good so what we're
going to do is we have one can of
artichokes here we just want to dry them
so we don't want all that nasty juice in
there just dry them a little
bit not be too
perfect all right so now I'm going to do
just chop them up a little bit this
one little kind of rough chop
them I don't want it too perfect want it
to look kind of
rustic
whoops
careful all right let's see here little
you would have want it small enough
where you can put on a cracker that's
for sure
right and I think this is done so now we
have our shallow baking dish right here
that we're going to use we're just going
to mix it all in here say very very
simple put our artichokes in
here which I love artichokes I love love
love artichokes and the flavor of them
this is perfect
ready going to put all those in
there all right so now we are just
chopping up three cloves of
gunet so going to take like this
chopping garlic people get so scared
about and buy that nasty stuff that's
bottle that has absolutely no flavor
please do not buy
that all right perfect right oh just a
warning this is
kind of
garlicky but it's so good all right so
now that's in
there we're going to put about a
qu4 cup of mayonnaise in here or half
cup sorry you want it just until it's
moist you don't want it to be like
really watery you just want it make it
so it's moist I can get anything out of
here all right let's mix this around
just a little bit more to make half
cup once again when you cook
measurements aren't important when you
bake they are all right perfect so now
we're going to put about 1/4 cup of
grated Parmesan in
here I love me some
Parmesan that now you can put as many
red pepper flakes as you want I'm going
to do about an eigh a teaspoon just cuz
I don't want it too spicy there you
go all right let's give this a nice stir
oh little bit of salt you don't need too
much because the parmesan has a lot of
salt all
righty mix it together now if you have a
bunch of people coming over just double
this recipe I can fit obvious lot more
in here
okay this looks
delicious SM it down a little
bit put just a little bit of Parmesan on
the
top just a little bit not too much and
you're
done to clean off the side a little bit
don't want to make make it look sloppy
all right so now we're going to put this
in a 3 250Â° oven and when we come back
nice bubbly artichoke
