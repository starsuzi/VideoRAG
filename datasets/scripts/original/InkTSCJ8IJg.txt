just by pulling along the track we'll
thread through the Thunder part however
when it's and this gray part reaches the
dis then you cannot adjust it anymore
it's went through the entire strap and
you can just pull a switch here to
shorten and thread that through sorry
I'm doing this with one hand so I'm
sorry it's a little crude
okay that is shorter and for just this
is too long you can just tuck it in the
elastic like so okay hope you understand
the concept of how to shorten the strap
