all right I'm going to show you a real
quick and easy way to cut laminate uh
for a lot of you Woodworkers that
haven't dealt with laminate a lot uh
somebody showed me a real easy way to do
it and and it's it's very accurate and
fast so I've cut one piece already and U
here's my list of laminates that I need
so I've cut 161 I'm going to cut another
61 and I'll show you how we do
it got here's one piece that we're use
later going to use a straight edge
clamps and a
router with a straight
bit and cut sheets
off
61 watch that
glare so we slide this St
my cutboard here's got a laminated Edge
on it so it's real hard and
smooth and my Mark is right there I'm
going to clamp right on that
Mark it's so accurate I can move this
board the 16th or 30 second one way or
the other and make really accurate
Cuts but I'm kind of just chopping these
off to
laminate these cabinet
fronts and the accuracy come later on
when
we uh when we route out the
openings all right so there's my Mark
here's my other Mark that's my straight
edge here's my bit straight
[Applause]
bit there's the cut just that
easy all right
