quietly in all of these buildings some
people presume the asbestos problems of
yesteryear have vanished since using the
material was banned in the UK far from
it we had inherited the asbestos legacy
over three thousand people die each year
as a result of exposure to asbestos
fibers making the remaining asbestos the
single biggest cause of UK work-related
deaths worryingly it's estimated that
asbestos remains in over one and a half
million UK premises often mixed with
other materials if it's damaged or
disturbed perhaps by maintenance or
refurbishment work it can prove to be
fatal if you're responsible for the
maintenance and general upkeep of a
building or premises you are also
responsible for its occupant staying
safe from asbestosis the Judy holder may
well be the landlord-tenant or managing
agent or in some situations the
responsibility may be shared
remember asbestos regulations also
cover common areas of domestic premises
including holes roof lift and stairways
