hi welcome to the full landscape lon
agile installation video today we'll be
installing some landscape edging with
lon edging or take it step by step help
me with my video let's get our hands
dirty
you
we've just finished one and this one we
made in a circle the circle is a little
bit small so on the next one we decided
to make it just a little bigger a little
different size we purchase the lawn
edging for about twenty dollars at Home
Depot and I had to get a couple extra
stakes so total looking at about thirty
bucks and that's going to do both the
lawn edging on this tree and this tree
so we started by digging the trench it
doesn't need to be very deep at all just
about the steep then lawn edging sits
right down inside of it and we started
by you putting in one stake here just
pound that right down into the little
edge very easy next we'll put in one
more stake here then we're going to
backfill from here to here maybe a
little fill here and that should do it
when we're done we're also going to take
remove the grass from this side so here
at the tree we're going to have just
mulch maybe some plants in the back but
no grass the grass will come up to it
here this is going to make it much
easier for weeding it will we'll be able
to weed eat up against this instead of
right into the mulch you can see now
even though we have mulch here we've got
so much of the grass coming into it
there's really no separation
so this lawn edging is going to help
give us that separation that we need
between these two lawn elements
so here we're doing the back filling
with some nice good black dirt get it
really packed in around
all right we've just finished removing
all the grass and that looks really good
might have to put a little bit more dirt
in there to get it built up and then
we'll cover it in the mulch again with
the plants in the back
it's going to give a nice degree of
separation and make it much easier for
the maintenance and the way to go along
this line and here's our finished
product looks really good
and over here and little baby come out
that looks really nice
