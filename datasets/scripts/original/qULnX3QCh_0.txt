Hi everyone
Welcome to another cooking with vida shows
In this video I want to show you how to make " Clotted Cream" (kaymak)
I hope you like this
In order to make homemade clotted cream
You only need one ingredient
Which is Whole milk or Heavy Cream
In this video I am using Heavy Cream
For every 1 liter of heavy cream you will get 350 ml clotted cream
Consider that if you use whole milk this will be less
Place a pan on the very low heat
You can use heat diffuser
In order to make sure the heat is distributed equally
Pour whole milk or heavy cream into the pan
Place it on low heat for 4 hours
Let it warm up gradually
By which time it will have a rich, deep-yellow, wrinkled crust
Note that the cream (milk) must not boil or simmer.
The order thing that I wanted to mention
Is that if you use a wider pan
You'll get more clotted cream
After 4 hours, as you see in video
There is a yellowish thick cream layer on top
Turn off the heat
And let it cool down to the room temperature
Then cover the pan with a plastic wrap
And pop it in the fridge for at least 8 hours
After refrigeration, clotted cream is ready
Lift off the crust using a spoon
And separate the thick from the thin
You can use the single cream
For baking cakes, making coffee or soup
Spoon the cream into sterilized glass jars, cover, and store in the fridge
Try to use it between 5 to 7 days
And if you noticed any changes in smell or color
Toss it away
Hope you give this a try very soon
This will be a good company beside honey or jams
