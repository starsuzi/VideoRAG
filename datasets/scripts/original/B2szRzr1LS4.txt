good day there snow crash here from Snow
Crash constructions today we've got a
quick and simple spider spawner XP
grinder to show you and it's quick and
simple for a real simple reason we don't
like spiders and they don't like us
spiders are difficult to work with
they're difficult to build things to
work work with them and quite frankly
most of the time we just couldn't be
bothered and cave spiders
well they're just a nightmare anyway
let's get on with the tutorial and
hopefully this will help a few
people it's pretty simple start clearing
out an 11 by 11 block area around the
spider spawner one block below the
spawner two blocks above the spawner
then you want to dig down a 3X3 hole in
the middle of the room 14 blocks
down but before you do that pop some
water into each corner of the spawning
room this will prevent us from having to
come back up
later okay okay just for illustration
here's the 14 blocks
down once you're down at the bottom you
just need to clear out a little tunnel
that's three wide by three high like
this there we
go hop in there and we'll put down our
chest some Hoppers facing into the
chest and then more Hoppers two facing
into the end one two facing into the
middle one and two facing into this
one now just clear out a little bit of
space above the uh killing room here
it's just
2x3 pop a couple of blocks above that
Hopper two blocks across the bottom here
two blocks across the top and then you
can put in your uh light detectors there
two trap doors there and well that's
pretty much it let's turn on the
difficulty and in a few moments the
spiders will start coming down
oh here they all are look at these
little guys they just love it don't they
well they're going to get some action in
a moment I can tell you there you go
nice simple spider spawner XP grinder
hope you enjoyed it anyway till next
time this is Snow Crash catch you later
