hello okay so we're doing a fire color
changing experiment this is kind of the
setup we have going on this is filled
with water and sodium chloride which is
you know iodized salt and this is water
softener potassium chloride which the
bag for it is huge it's a 40 lb big so
it's right here and you can find that at
Walmart
and then this is supposed to be this
salt the IOD eyes you know is supposed
to be yellow fire and the water softener
supposed to make a purple
fire and then we have in this bucket ice
melt which
has yep it's an extreme formula it
says and yep it's good stuff and it's
supposed to make make an orange
fire and then in this one we have epson
salt which you can get at Walmart also
so all these things you can get at
Walmart this is this has calcium
chloride in it so if you're getting ice
melt you need to make sure it has calci
it's a calcium chloride or else it's not
going to be orange like it's supposed to
so what I did was I put water in each of
the five gallon buckets and then
mixed some of the stuff in there like
the salt and it started out I was
measuring it and I was measuring it
until it was dissolved or it was barely
dissolving anymore and that didn't work
out in the first video so what I did was
is I just kept adding more to
this until it got to the point where it
was really cloudy it wasn't dissolving
and you could tell that there was too
much in it and that when I stopped and
we also have some
borax which will make a nice green flame
and what we're going to do we're not
going to soak this in
water like we did these because we don't
have as much of it so this will make a
green flame and what we'll do is we'll
sprinkle we'll put this denaturalized
alcohol on the pine cone and then we'll
sprinkle The Borax on it and light it on
fire
so this will be yellow Flame the salt
the water softener is supposed to be
purple the ice melt supposed to be
orange and the Epson salt is supposed to
be white breakdown of
that and we soaked pine cones for 24
hours in each of these before we didn't
we did it about 8 hours that didn't work
out so we're kind of doubling the time
we're also going to wait a lot longer
for them to dry
out okay so here we have our pine cones
that that I've been soaking for roughly
12 hours 24
hours right here and I have them labeled
so P for purple so this is the water
softener and hopefully the wind doesn't
pick up and drag these away cuz I wanted
them out in the sun to
dry all
right okay and this mess right here are
Crum crumpled up newspapers that I put
in a sour cream
container after they'd been soaking and
I hope that these will do a really good
job of showing the different colors we
won't need a you know a starter for it
we can just use a match and start it on
fire that way we're not going to need
alcohol or anything like that so maybe
these will give us a better indication
of the change in fire color all right
