when you braise a tough cut of meat such
as lamb shank brisket or pork shoulder
in a flavorful liquid you make it fall
off the bone tender we'll do a brown
braise
it's called brown because the meat is
seared and the veggies are browned
before the liquid is added
the first step is to season your meat
we're using lamb shanks
and get your pot nice and hot
you want a heavy bottomed deep pot with
a lid for braising like a dutch oven
add some oil
[Music]
then brown or sear the meat
you want it to be deep dark brown on all
sides
now remove and set aside
add the vegetables to the dutch oven
brown them up
and when they're nice and soft
deglaze with red wine
the acidity helps to balance the
richness of the meat and to release
those brown bits on the bottom of the
pan
be sure to scrape them up that's where
all the flavor lives
now place your meat back in the pot
add stock or water halfway up the sides
of the meat you're braising
and bring to a boil then immediately
lower to a simmer once it simmers add in
the aromatics your recipe suggests
like bay leaves
juniper
or orange peel
cover and keep it at a low simmer cook
on the stovetop or in the oven at 350
degrees
cooking low and slow gently breaks down
the tough meat into something tender and
delicious
check on it occasionally the liquid
level should be the same add more if you
need to it will take about one and a
half to three hours to become fork
tender depending on the size and cut of
the meat you use when it's just fork
tender it's done
and with just a little effort you've got
amazing results
