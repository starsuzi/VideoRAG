Hey friends today I'm going to show you how
to make your very own chalk.
For this you're going to need some plaster
of paris, some water, a mould, a mixing bowl,
a spoon some paints and a ziploc bag.
First take your plaster of paris in a bowl
and add some water in it, don't add too much
you just need to make a smooth paste.
Now you can leave it white or colour it with
your choice of paints . I'm using some red
paint.
Now 
take your plaster of paris and fill it in
a small ziploc bag this will make it easier
to pour it in your mould and now seal it.
Now take your mould.
I'm using one of the glue bottles from my
last videos.
Make a small slit in the corner of the ziploc
bag.
Now pour it in your moulds.
You can experiment with different colours
and different moulds.
Now let it set for 2-3 days and after 3 days
you can remove it from your moulds and there
you have it you're very own chalk.
See you can write with it.
Thanks for watching and don't forget to like.
