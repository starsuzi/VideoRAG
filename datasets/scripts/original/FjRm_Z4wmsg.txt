hey guys wanted to show you something
amazing I A friend of mine gave me this
old uh really really rusted cast iron
cook pot and it's it's
even worse on the inside been sitting
outside for looks like years but
searching on the internet I found out
that if you soak it in vinegar and water
that it'll dissolve the rest and take it
off and make it clean and so I did I
used about in this Rubbermaid bin
probably I don't know 3
l of uh of vinegar and the rest water
and soaked it in here disgusting the
first few days didn't really do much the
last couple of days it started making
this nasty stinky
foam and uh it looked looked like it was
doing a pretty good job so I took it out
to check my
progress and here you can see it is
completely
removed the rust well it was still
looking like this but if you just rub
it the rust comes right off it's
completely dissolved it I still have to
put it back in there for a few more days
to get this stuff on the inside out but
absolutely amazing so I'm going to be
able to use this awesome some soup
pot and I hope this works for you thanks
for watching
