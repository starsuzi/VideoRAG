green peas quarter cup of carrots less

cilantro corn red bell pepper in quarter
cup of chopped onions green chillies as
per your taste 2 TSP cumin seeds
2 TSP crushed coriander seeds 1/2 tbsp
garam masala powder few drops of lemon

sugar as per your taste
2 TSP of oil salt to taste and 1/2 tea
spoon of chaat masala we also need a
puff pastry here I have a store-bought

so let's make the filling here I have a
pan that's heating up and I'm going to
add 2 TSP of oil when the oil is hot add
cumin seeds and let it crack and add
chopped onions and we're going to saute

crushed coriander mix it really well and
we are going to saute this for about a
minute or two add salt as per your taste
and garam masala powder and chat masala
and few drops of lemon is I wanted to
make a little chat pata and sugar
add chopped coriander and cook this
mixture on high heat as we don't want
any moisture in it as we wanted to have
a dry filling and I'm going to mash it
with the potato masher just too so that
it binds the filling so here my savory
mixed vegetable filling is ready now
take the pastry sheet and I'm going to
fill the pastry sheet half in a triangle
shape I wanted to make it in a triangle
shape so I'm just filling half of the
part and then I'm going to turn it over
and before that I'm going to apply some
water on the edges so it sticks better
now close the edges tightly so here the
pastry is filled and I'm going to take a
baking sheet and spray with some cooking
spray and I'm going to place the pups on
the sheet and and I'm ready to bake this
in the oven my oven is preheated at 420
degrees and I'm going to bake this for
10 minutes
