so my Little Darlings have spilled
coffee on the
carpet stains all dried in I'm just
going to get the stain out now with Mrs
gleams carpet and upholstery
cleaner so I squirt I'm just going to
squirt on this half of the
stain um leave this for about 30 seconds
to do its work it's bleach free peroxide
free it's safe to use on all different
cards carpets so I know it's not going
to cause any damage to this one
now I'm just going to leave it just for
another few seconds and then blop the
stain out and see if the coffee has
gone t
