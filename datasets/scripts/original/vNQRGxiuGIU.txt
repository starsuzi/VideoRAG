dude this is nicole i wanted to do a
video and show you my gooseberry
i started the seed earlier this year and
it's got
fruit on it um
i am excited to see that it is
putting these husks on but i don't
really feel
anything inside yet so i just wanted to
show you it's still flowering it's still
putting on those husks
um and i guess it's like a relative of
the uh
tomatillo tomatillo plant
it was looking much healthier and some
kind of bug that
attacked it and looks like it's got leaf
miners or something on it but
it's still holding on so far i just
wanted to show you
what this looks like and
hopefully i'll get a chance to get a
fruit
and actually taste it i have no idea
what these taste like
all right y'all we'll take it easy i got
these
uh seeds from baker creek i actually had
the packet last year
and uh i just started them again because
i wasn't successful last year i didn't
give the plant
a big enough pot and this year i put it
in this size pot
so i think that's a sunflower one
accidentally dropped in
seed accidentally dropped in there all
right y'all i just wanted to share
my gooseberry plant um i have one in the
yard as well
it's not looking as healthy but um
hopefully this will this will
uh give me some fruit i don't know if i
needed another plant for
cross-pollination
maybe i need to put this back there
i need to do some more reading anyway
take care y'all
