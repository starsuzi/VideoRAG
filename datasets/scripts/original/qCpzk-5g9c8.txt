hi this is dan from a low post ree and
interiors today i'm going to show you
how to poster this so far so now we'll
be using the fabric here as the lining
because they didn't have it I'll be
using kind of felt on the deck after
that I'll be using quarter inch foam so
the fabric I'll be using will be a dark
gray chenille
now I'll be using a four inch curved
needle like this with a two-pound nylon
string to sew on the deck
now I'll be using one inch per fall for
the front edge so it goes a little
higher than the back
now I'll be using package fold followed
by a thin layer of fiber
so now I'll be using one-and-a-half-inch
firm foam the same like the original
now I'm using a thin layer fiber so it
gives it a nice soft look to it
now you're gonna cut where the wood is
for the back arm you just add a little
fiber so you look for the wood
for the back I'll be using one-inch
softball followed by thin layer
now you're gonna cut where the wood is
and cut up
Oh
Oh
you
now I'm using high-pitched cardboard to
trim the outside hair
now I'm using a thin layer fiber without
side back I'm using a quarter inch
piping
now I'm using a thin layer of fiber
now I'll be using packing scripts for
the outside back
for the facing I used half inch foam
plus fiber
here's how the finished product looks
