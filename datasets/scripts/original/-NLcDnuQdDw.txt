go to see an exotic Frozen desert is
undoubtedly one of the best sweet treats
that the Indian subcontinent has to
offer to the Delicacies of the world
today I'm very excited to be making some
kulfi for you so let's get started
you need to start off by pouring in
eight cups or two liters of milk into a
heavy bottomed pan
one can of condensed milk
1 cup milk powder
[Music]
you need to mix this all up together
[Music]
one of the secrets to making great kulfi
is to use top quality ingredients so you
need to use full cream milk here
and the other secret is the right amount
of caramelization of the milk once all
the ingredients are properly mixed
together
you need to raise the heat to medium and
allow the milk to come to a rolling boil
once the milk comes to a rolling boil
you need to turn down the heat and allow
the milk to cook for about 25 to 30
minutes
[Music]
wow
[Music]
so while you enjoy your music don't
forget to keep stirring in between to
prevent the milk from sticking to the
bottom of the pan
as the milk continues to thicken I'm
going to stir in about 4 tablespoons of
sugar

into the milk I'm gonna put in some
cardamom Powder made from the seeds of
about 8 to 10 cardamom pods
some nutmeg powder
mix it up together
[Music]
and then I'm going to pour in a little
full of the milk into the spice mixture
[Music]
and mix it up together
if you add the cardamom powder directly
then it might form into lumps which will
be difficult to disintegrate into the
milk
I'm going to stir this back into the
milk
[Music]
mix it up together
the milk is now thick and smooth and is
required this beautifully caramel color
[Music]
after the milk cools down you can pour
the thickened milk into the cookie molds
and freeze thinset it should take about
six to eight hours for the coffee is to
set properly
