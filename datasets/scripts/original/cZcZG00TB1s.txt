hello this is Tim with a Appliance in
Toledo Ohio and welcome back to another
inhome diagnostic video brought to you

uh we're on a Kenmore washing machine
that will not drain so the first thing
that we're going to do is put it into
its its drain and try and start
it there there's a little switch right
here when you close the lid you should
hear it actuate and I'm not hearing that
so what we're going to do is just try
and press this guy
down and it's not working either so I'm
just going to support it from the bottom
and hit the switch
and now it's now it is spinning and
draining so we know that we have a bad
lid switch and need to change that out
okay the tools that we'll need for this
repair are a common screwdriver with a
Phillips bit a 316 snut driver or socket
uh just a a tag puller or a common
screwdriver and a little common
screwdriver all right so to get the get
to the lid switch which you just need to
take off these side
pieces and if you just grab in the
middle
and pull they should come off pretty
easy that'll give us access to the
two uh Phillips screws that secure the
console to the
cabinet and I take these all the way out
otherwise when you flip the panel back
they fall and
they always seem to go in a bad spot or
a drain or
something so now we're going to unplug
our unit to be
safe put the control panel into the
service
position and here's where our lid switch
connector is so we'll lift up on this
little Tab and pull the connector out
next we'll take a you can use a common
screwdriver or
I have a tack puller okay so now we're
going to remove the
uh little mounts on here little clips
and to do that we'll insert our tool and
push that way it'll release them uh just
remember how they go in if you're not
used to them they're they're they get
kind of weird to put back together but
we'll do that on the same on the other
side okay so now we can pull the the
whole cabinet forward and there are two
uh little guides on the bottom that we
need to disengage and we can remove our
entire panel to gain uh easy access to
our lid switch okay the first step in
replacing the lid switch is we're going
to remove the elect electrical connector
and there are two tabs on each side that
we need to depress and push
down and that will free that connector
next we're going to remove the two
Phillips mounting screws and we'll
just take both of those guys
off with those free we'll now move to
the bottom and remove the the ground
screw and remove the wiring harness from
its clip okay so we're now going to
remove our uh 316 grounding
screw from the cabinet
and with that removed the only we have
the the the rest of the wires that come
from the switch
are have a little clip on them the
easiest way I've found is to take this
plastic
piece and push it so that it is no
longer in that clip and then if we just
pull the little part back it comes out
and we have another little clip right up
here and that's just the easiest way to
do it now on this switch we can
see uh where it started to come apart
right here where it's where it's
molded right there is where it broke so
that is confirmed uh we will have to
transfer this guard right here so what
we're going to do is just put a little
screwdriver in there and pry
up on that guy and we
will pull that out and put that on the
new Switch all right so when you get a
new Switch they'll have uh this whole
rubber guard the first thing to do is
crack that in half and remove the longer
of the
two and then we will just put our wires
through that same
clip and then pull it back a little bit
to
route that
uh wire protector part and then we can
uh reinstall our our electrical
connector and there is a little tab that
corresponds with a little tab up there
to get it properly seated then we will
route the rest of our wires through the
clip on the
back now we
can put on our our
guard and to do that we'll just lift
down on the the
switch clear some
room and push on this part to engage the
the clip
now we can put on our ground
screw and we'll take our 316 wrench and
tighten that down
then we'll just pull the little wiring
back to get a nice
little spot on there last but not least
we'll then uh remount our lid switch uh
up at the top here all right we're now
going to remount our lid switch and
we'll just line up the holes with the
the mounting holes on the
switch and tighten down our Phillips
screws
and then we'll seat the other one in
there and with those nice and tight
listen for the
click that's the click you want to hear
so now we're going to put the cabinet
back onto our washing machine all right
we're now going to put our cabinet back
on and there are two holes in the bottom
of this guy that correspond to the two
slots on our cabinet here or on our
frame so we're going to turn this guy
around get it just under the cabinet
under the
frame and slide it on back
and there are also two guides on the on
the on the back rails so if you come to
the back and just pull you'll see if
they line up or
not and the true test will be when we go
to put our Clips back in if they go in
nice then you've done it
right that was pretty
nice same thing on the other side
no problem we'll put our switch back
in make the
connection and now put our control panel
into its rifle
position now I always give it a test
before we button it back up so we're
going
to give the machine some
power and it is spinning as soon as we
close the lid so we have have a a good
fix now is a good time when you when you
uh after it's been spinning for a little
bit to lift up the lid and make sure
that the uh basket comes to a
nice slow stop if it's jerking or
anything you may need to adjust the
brake a little bit this one is perfect
so we're just going to reinstall our
mounting screws
one on each side our Phillip
screws these do not have to be highly
torqued or you'll crack the plastic so
just get them in there nice
and
firm and then we will reinstall our
corner pieces
and get our machine back into the right
position these have uh
adjustable legs in the back so if you
lift it up and down a couple times uh
they'll automatically adjust to the
right spot and we have completed our
repair thank you for watching another
