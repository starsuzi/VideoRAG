Turn mini- blinds into beautiful roman shades
all on your own.
You'll need white faux wood blinds, thick
upholstery fabric, pencil, scissors, decoupage,
bowl for decoupage, foam brush, clothes pins,
tape measure.
Iron.
First, figure out how long your blinds need
to be.
Using a large work area, lay out the blind
facing down and pull them out to the length
of the window.
Snip away only the ladder strings on both
sides.
This is the string that connects the slacks.
Whatever you do don't remove the single, thicker
cord.
This is what moves the Roman shade up and
down.
[ MUSIC ] The slats will need to be seven
inches apart.
Divide the length of your window in inches
by seven.
To determine how many slats you'll need.
[ MUSIC ] Snap off the slats you don't need.
[ MUSIC ] Lay out the fabric beneath the blind
and space out the remaining slats evenly,
about seven inches apart, which will provide
nice folds in the final shade.
[ MUSIC ] The fabric should extend beyond
the slats about two inches and about two inches
on the top and bottom.
The blind operation should be at the back.
Start at the top.
Pop out the stopper on the end of the top
bracket.
Notch the fabric, so it wraps nicely around
the end.
Coat both bracket and the fabric with glue,
called decoupage medium.
Wrap the fabric around the top bracket.
Use clothespins to clamp while it dries.
Glue the fabric around onto the backside of
the slats where you marked the slat placement
before.
You just need to glue the edges on the front
and back, not the whole slat.
[ MUSIC ] Place clothespins on the edges of
the slats to insure those areas adhere nicely.
Roll the edge of the fabric over, so you get
a clean edge.
Glue into place.
Wrap the fabric around the bottom bar and
clamp with clothespins.
Let dry completely before hanging.
Install like normal mini blinds and the best
part is they're operational like normal blinds,
but much prettier.
