hi my name is lani puang from dinner
bilani and today i'm going to teach you
how to make a balsamic vinegar
substitute
oftentimes i would look in my pantry and
i'm ready to make a wonderful balsamic
vinaigrette and there's no balsamic
vinegar but not to worry
you can easily substitute the balsamic
vinegar with two ingredients that you
will most likely have in your pantry
that is sugar and red wine vinegar if
you don't have red wine vinegar you can
also use apple cider vinegar or regular
vinegar would work just as great all
right so very simple and easy all you
have to do is use one tablespoon of your
vinegar
so just pour it in your little bowl
half teaspoon of sugar
whisk
and there you have it one tablespoon of
balsamic vinegar
you
