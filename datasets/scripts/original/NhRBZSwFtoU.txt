hi I'm my name is Luke I'm I've done
some videos for Mar's candies I'm I'm
Mar's
grandson So today we're making pork
sausages the
deliciousness well the first thing you
want to do is wash your hands cuz you
don't want anything to happen
so if you if you have seen some of my
videos I haven't been around that much
well that would be nice to make another
video with my
grandma and show you how to cook
things so first thing you want to do is
get your pork sausages well we got pork
sa pork sausages cuz we like pork
sausages and then you need
cast iron skillet and you need
water and a
lid
so
today going to be some beautiful
sausages okay so we want to cover them
with
water so they're
covered and then want to cover with the
lid
you want to turn the stove on
high so it
boils okay so you're going to bring it
to a boil and then let it simmer for 20
minutes so now it's boiling so now we're
going to turn it down to a medium and
whatever it takes for your oven to
simmer for how long for like for 20
minutes so whenever you're cooking
sausage you want to see that the steam
com coming out so you know that it's
simmering and don't let all the water
boil boil away so that the sausages get
burned okay they're done so you want to
turn the flame
down and this is very careful you want
to step back and P it off away from you
if you have any water in your pan you
want to put it in the
sink and then you're going to turn your
stove on
medium okay so this is what the flame
should look
like okay so you want to keep rolling
around so it don't
stick and a nice golden brown see like
that so that little beautifulness right
there or you can use a fork to move it
around
