this video is to show you how to clear a
clogged toilet first thing to note
underneath the toilet there are two
little knobs or at least one little knob
back there if for any reason this goes
wrong twist them until they come off um
you know shut the water off because
that's the water flow mechanism so if
this doesn't work for whatever reason
twist that till the water goes off but
this is how to toilet the easy way here
is a very large bucket of water it's um
probably about 2 gallons worth or more
or
less but when you this is for like when
it doesn't have like an obstruction
obstruction but just through normal use
through whatever happened to it but yeah
me
just and
toilet now what you want to do is dump
this whole thing in that Center Point
right where the stuff goes
down first start flushing
it now you're going to want to dump the
whole
bucket down that Center
Point all at
once the weight of the water forces the
whatever is obstructing it through yep
