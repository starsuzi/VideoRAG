hey guys
um so I've been watching a lot of videos
on YouTube about
hedgehogs and lots of them show you how
to clip their nails but they only show
how to do that on nice hedgehogs they
don't how to show they don't show how to
do it on aggressive
hedgehogs and I recently rescued an
aggressive Hedgehog who passed away cuz
he was was old but he was really
aggressive and he needed his nails
clipped and me and my mom couldn't
figure out how to do it and so finally
we realized don't do that stop we
figured out a way how to do it so this
is Hugo he's not aggressive but he'll
work okay for showing how to do it since
boss passed away anyways so here I'll
show you how to do it
so you got to put your hedgehog about
this way and then you got to grab
them along right
here so your fingers are touching the
furry part of them right here and then
you just kind of pull up sort of like a
mother cat would on her kitten and you
hold them like this now I didn't get a
very good grip so I'll have to do it
again so you just wait till they're
standing there
and you reach there I got a better one
and then their little
feet see are sticking out and to get
their back feet sometimes you have to
wait quite a
while to be able to get them but you see
how I'm holding and it doesn't hurt them
because they have really loose skin so
you just hold them like that and then
you take the nail clippers
and you
just
clip but you have to be really
careful not to get too much so his nails
don't actually need to be clipped right
now but I just wanted to show you how
and see even when he's
struggling he still can't get away
because you've got such a good grip and
then to do the back feet you just have
to wait until see his back feet were
coming out when they eventually give up
struggling then the back feet come out
in and you can do it that way too so
there you go that's how to trim an
aggressive Hedgehog's Nails hope it
works for you bye
