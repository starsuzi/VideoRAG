hey so something I was thinking about
while I was sitting here waiting for the
leather things to dry was
how many stages of sanding do you do how
many different ones and it is honestly
different for every
different type of rock you use
so I go from grinding
with my drill
and a diamond Grit
or diamond
let's see
caked up because I was using it last
night
polish this little beauty
so you can't see it here but look
it's gorgeous
okay
so
um
for a heart or stone like this which
this is an agate
it's translucent you can see that
um
I'll be posting pictures of this once
it's finished
on my chaos Rock and jewelry page
um
but looking over here you can see you
have different types of stones I got a
couple of agates Jaspers
Petoskey stone
so the harder the stone
the more steps you're going to need to
get a really great polish
so you're going to start
with your cut shape and then you're
going to grind out a dome
and you want it to be nice and even and
you don't want any flat spots
once you've achieved that then you're
going to take it over here
and use
a larger size
sandpaper which would be for me would be
probably a 180
on a leather pad and
that will get most of the scratches out
because once you go from that to the 320
paper
you're you're going to look through it
with a magnifying glass between each
step and you are going to see scratches
if you don't do enough different steps
so then you have Stones like parasite
okay parasite is a stone only found in
Utah
where I am and it it is very soft
[Music]
see
so it is very soft Stone
much like calcite
okay or banded Onyx those all I just
skip right up to the 320.
okay and then from there I do the 600
and then from there if I'm feeling
froggy I go up to 1 000 or 1200 and then
I shoot to 2000 then four thousand and
by then it's usually got an amazing
polish and I don't have to go any
further whereas with the harder stones
like this puppy Jasper
I will have to go at least
up to twelve thousand if if not all the
way up to using
50 000 grit Diamond powder
on
either a polishing cloth
that's been glued to a mandrel
or
um
a polishing
pad that already has the Polish built in
you need to be very careful that you do
not intermix these
and that you do not allow other grits to
touch
because once it's contaminated you're
going to end up with scratches now this
one is a fun one I collected
myself
I'll bring it in here where you can see
it in the light
so this is the opalite
now
when it's polished it is just gonna be
absolutely fantastic
but you can see
that I got tired of working it on the
320.
so there's a couple little spots that
I'm going to have to go over a lot
but the deal is if you
use the finer grit paper
I'm sorry the larger grit paper and work
work through as many different papers as
possible you'll find that this one's fun
you'll find that you will
not go through as much paper and it will
last longer and then once you get up to
the finer grits
that's where the paper goes really fast
so
that's the more expensive paper and you
don't want to go through it as fast so I
really work my stones at the lower
levels of 180 to 20 320 400 500 600
depending on what stone it is so this is
labradite
it was a bead that was broken
so I decided I would polish it and make
a cab out of it
and find the hole there's a hole there
and a hole there
has a lot of play a lot of color and
once I'm done polishing it it is going
to be absolutely fantastic
so I'm going to show you how to put
together the mandrels with the
leather now it's not very hard
thank you
I wish I had a better way of doing this
I don't even know
okay this might work sorry if I'm making
you all sick
okay well it's pretty simple you just
take one of these
little sandpaper do do my hickeys
and you take I went out and bought a
bunch of plastic washers
okay and I also use the washers that
come with the mandrel
so you're gonna make it so the Sandpaper
is facing outward
so that is why we're putting the
screw through the top there
it's really hard to do with one hand
sorry
I'm gonna have to figure out a better
way to videotape
that's only if people actually are
watching these videos
if you are go to my Facebook page chaos
Rock and jewelry and tell me that you
are learning something
and leave a comment below and subscribe
I'm gonna
really work hard to have
as many videos as possible
so take it
put it together okay
see usually goes a lot faster when I'm
not eat when I can use both hands okay
then you just uh for me I use pliers
okay
and I hold the back of the mandrel and I
screw it together
and then I'm going to put it in the
Dremel and I will come back to you then
okay so you can see I've put it together
tightened it down the next thing we're
going to do is turn the water on
just put the water on okay it's gonna
come down here and I just want to make
sure that it is as close
to my little PAD as possible so I can
get it to stay there even better
okay and then I'm just going to start
polishing
so I set my machine to the lowest
setting
turn it on
and I told you we're going to work this
Stone and make sure it's nice and wet
okay and then we're just gonna start
polishing okay you want to make sure
that the water is hitting
sandpaper
because that is what's going to keep the
Sandpaper from penetrating completely
and I'm just going to work around the
holes down take my time
I may go through one or two of these
leather pads
I just want to make sure that every
single itty bitty little scratch is gone
okay
so I will be back when I am done with it
hey so I know that I'm not done but I
wanted to show you a trick on how to see
if you're getting close enough
being done
okay so one of those is I just get my
little apron and I wipe this off
okay
then I hold it up to the light
like this
and when you hold it at an angle you can
see where there are holes okay I see two
holes cracks
no cracks that's good but there are a
couple holes
and a bunch of grinding
marks left from the diamonds
grinder so I'm gonna have to go over
this for quite some time just to make
sure that it is as perfect as I can make
it
and then I will get back with you
