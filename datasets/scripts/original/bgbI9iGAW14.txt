In this clip we're going to be drawing the
points of maximum camber and depth in the
sail. For this Omega 14 Jib we're going to
put the point of maximum camber at 32 % after
the left. Remember this sail is lofted Starbird
side up for good luck, so. We can take a ruler
or tape measure, go from our string that's
going to approximate our leech hollow, so
not from the straight line leech, but from
our hollowed leech, and go to our left position.
In this case it's 77 1/2 inches. Now the cell
you're building might have different measurements,
but it's all the same process. So I take 77
1/2 into the calculator, multiply by .32.
That means our point of maximum camber is
going to be at 24.8 inches. 24 and 3/4, I
usually make just a little mark there so I
know when I go to do my broad seaming, that's
where the maximum camber goes. When you're
doing your broad seaming marks it's also a
good time to kind of check the rest of your
sail and make sure that you've made all of
the marks where they need to be. If you mark
in this fashion you won't be confusing your
panels, and you'll make sure that everything
lines up good from the get go. So we'll keep
measuring all these panels all the way up
to sail. So like this seam width here is 60
inches, 60 times .32, 19.2 inches. We'll put
a little mark, and for our next seam map it's
42 1/2 inches long times .32, 13.6 inches,
and in our final seam, 27 inches. The top
seam is totally flat. Once you pull it up
off the floor there's no going back, so be
sure it's perfect. Okay, pull your pins with
confidence.
