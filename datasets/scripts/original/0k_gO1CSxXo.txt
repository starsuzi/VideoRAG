hi this is Michael and this is my review
of the frigidere 70 pint dehumidifier
the model is the F
a704
DWD that's this one right here this is
last year's model and this is The Fad
704
duud and uh they're identical the cases
are
identical front SI and back are
absolutely identical I just wanted to
show you this one which I currently own
and I've had operating for uh less than
a
year this then is the replacement and
this is the brand new 2013 model so just
want to show you the back panel
here there's a cord wrap it uses a three
pin grounded plug and if you want want
to use continuous operation and what
that means is if you want to hook a hose
up to this so it drains directly into a
drain you hook your hose to this
connector right here and this is just
the cap that closes that off in case you
do not want to use continuous
operation there are handles on the side
here to help pick it up and also there's
a really nice handle that just inserts
right into the top and then in the front
here is the water container here and
this just slides right out there's a
handle to help you pick it up but I did
find this is a little difficult to empty
I'm always spilling water I'm not sure
why it's just kind of an awkward shape
now when I got this this float here had
come detached and it was just flopping
around in the
inside and uh I fix that
myself pretty
handy and then then there is a little
indicator here you can see where the
water level is and then on this side
it's just
plain this is the control panel located
on the top of the unit onof timer this
is where you set your humidity levels
fan speed can be set to high or low and
then these are indicators for the bucket
full and the clean filter and this is
the button to reset the filter timer so
to turn this on you just push the onoff
button
and as you can hear it's very quiet I I
don't think this is could be considered
loud whatsoever uh this is at the high
speed and here's the low
speed now air is ejected out of the top
of the unit
here and settings are retained in the
event of uh power outage if you want to
set up continuous operation
you would just leave the timer off and
this will run continuously and that's
assuming you have a hose hooked up so
that it'll
drain however if you want timed
operation then you would just push the
timer and then set the number of hours
that you want this to operate and this
will go up to 24
hours uh function of that is how much
humidity you have and how fast your
water container fills
up
this is the carry handle here very easy
to get to and it just folds away out of
the way when you're not using it on the
front of the unit when you take out the
water container that gives you access to
the filter which is located up here and
this just simply pulls out and you can
clean it replace it whatever you'd like
and then it just slips right back in
there and the design in here is very
clean and uncluttered
and the unit does have Caster
wheels and they roll very
easily and this is the entire unit it's
very
slim doesn't take up a whole lot of
space operates very
quietly and I think it's a very
attractive design this is the third
frigid a 70p dehumidifier that I've
had and uh I think they operate very
well and I'm very happy with them
