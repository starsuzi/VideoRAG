hey all chef irick skye here back again
with the uh
weber one touch gold you can see i've
got it in the copper color
with that nice ash tray on the bottom
for convenience
and what i'm doing now i wanted to
explain how to
the best way to cook vegetables on a
weber one touch gold grill
this is a kettle style grill so what
i've got i've got the uh you can see
here in the aluminum full got the
vegetables marinated got
onions mushrooms etc
and i've got a little hole in there so
what i'll do i'm going to get the lid
to the weber one touch gold
i'm going to put that in what that'll do
and i'm actually cooking on a
combination
it's it's charcoal except it has a
little bit of hickory mixed in with it
so this kettle style grill is just
really cool for the uh
for the heat distribution it keeps a
really nice temperature in there
and then the uh since i've got a little
bit of
an opening in the top of the uh
aluminum foil that the vegetables are in
it'll allow that hickory flavor to go in
so i'm not only cooking them
but i'm adding an essence of hickory
and then when i get ready after those
cook for a while of course i've got
plenty of room
for the steaks that i'm also cooking but
vegetables take longer i like to make
them really soft and
and flavorful so just another awesome
awesome weber one touch gold grilling
idea so
