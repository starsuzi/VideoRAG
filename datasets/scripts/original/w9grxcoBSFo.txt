welcome back to the wolf pit today I'm
making goulash but this isn't the
American Style Goulash with ground beef
and elbow macaroni that most of us are
used to eating this is a Polish style
beef goulash which has bite-sized chunks
of chuck roast peppers onions and
mushrooms similar to Melting your mouth
perfection in a rich and savory sauce
it's very simple to make and very
delicious so let's get started
let's get started by seasoning the
chunks of chuck roast with salt and
black pepper you can find a full
printable copy of this recipe and many
more at thewolfpit.com
and now add some all-purpose flour and
this flour must have been vegan because
it did not want to come out of the
measuring cup and get mixed in with the
meat
once you finely coarse the flour out of
the measuring cup into the meat get your
hands in there and give it a good mix
and like I always say when you mix
things with your hands they taste better
and make sure all the meat is nicely
dusted with flour
now I'm adding olive oil to a preheated
cast iron skillet over medium heat if
you don't have a cast iron pan that's
fine just use the heaviest bottom pan
you have that's another great thing
about this goulash it's all prepared in
one pan one pan makes for an easy
cleanup
now shake off any excess flour and add
half of the meat
spread it out into a nice even layer and
let it sit there for about two minutes
to form a nice crust
after two minutes flip all the pieces
over and let them go for two more
minutes
after four to five minutes the meat will
have a nice crust now remove the meat
and add the second batch of meat and
repeat the same process
once all the meat has been browned
you're going to have bits and pieces
stuck to the bottom of the pan this is
called fond which will come off the
bottom of the pan as we add moisture and
add lots of flavor to the dish now add
sliced yellow onion red and yellow bell
pepper or you can just use green bell
pepper
now add sliced mushrooms give everything
a good mix let it cook down for about
five minutes over medium Heat
now mix in fresh chopped garlic
add the meat back to the skillet
followed by tomato paste
chicken broth
Hungarian paprika
and salt and pepper
and then give it a good mix
and if it's a little thick at this point
add a little bit of water
give it a good mix bring it up to a boil
cover reduce the heat to medium low and
let it simmer for two and a half to
three hours or until the meat is forked
tender after simmering for three hours
the meat is forked tender and everything
is cooked down now I'm going to thicken
it up a bit with a little bit of
cornstarch slurry which is equal parts
cornstarch and cold water
mix it in until it's thickened
now I'm serving it over classic potato
pancakes or you can serve it over
noodles or dumplings
and if you don't want to use beef for
this recipe you can also use pork
and there you have it polish style beef
goulash served over classic potato
pancakes with a little bit of sour cream
on top
this turned out absolutely delicious the
meat was melting your mouth tender the
sauce was rich Savory and absolutely
delicious
