I’m sharing with you how to make a Pavlova,
this a popular dessert here in New Zealand
made out of egg whites and sugar.
It’s kind of like a meringue on the outside
but like eating a sweet fluffy cloud on the
inside, served with freshly whipped cream
and whichever kind of fruit is in season.
It’s eaten all year round but especially
around Christmas you’ll find it everywhere.

You’re going to need 6 egg whites for this
dessert.
Separate the eggs one at a time in a seperate
bowl before adding it into a large bowl or
the bowl of your stand mixer.
It’s important to do this in a smaller bowl
first just incase an egg yolk breaks, it doesn’t
ruin the whole batch.
Any trace of yolk and the meringue just won’t
whip up properly as the fat in the egg yolk
suppresses it.
You’ll need some sort of mixer for this
recipe whether thats a hand mixer or a stand
mixer.
We’re going to be whipping the egg white
into a meringue on quite a high speed so there
is no way you’ll be able to do it by hand.
A stand mixer is easier as you have both of
your hands free for slowly adding your ingredients
but a hand mixer will be just fine.
If you would like the full recipe for this
Pavlova it will be on my website as well as
the full measurements in the description box
below.
Let me know in the comments below if you’ve
ever made or tried a Pavlova.
There is a little bit of a debate over whether
its a Kiwi or Australian dessert, but it’s
most definitely from New Zealand.
It’s named after a Russian ballerina who
visited in the 1920s.
Usually freshest is best put pavlova is actually
a great way to use up any older eggs you may
have.
The whites aren’t as tightly bound as they
age meaning they whip up for Pav much better.
You may be wondering what you should do with
all of those leftover egg yolks.
They’ll keep in the fridge for a few days
but a great way to use them up is to make
a lemon curd, this pairs perfectly on top
of a Pav.
If not they’re great to add into scrambled
eggs for a richer flavour.
When you’ve separated all of your eggs turn
your mixer onto a low speed at first until
the egg whites become foamy, then turn to
a medium speed.
When you’re make a meringue it’s important
to start on a low speed first as using a high
speed creates air bubbles much more quickly
but they aren’t uniform.
This makes the meringue much less stable and
more prone to collapsing.
While the egg whites are whipping up, measure
out the sugar.
You’ll need castor sugar for this recipe
or it may also be known as super fine sugar.
It’s not as fine as icing or powdered sugar
but a lot finer than granulated white sugar.
If you can’t find this just place your normal
sugar in a food processor and process until
it is finer.
We need this type of sugar as it dissolves
much easier and faster into the meringue.
You’ll need one and a half cups or 250g.
You’ll notice I give the measurements in
metric and imperial so no matter where you
are from in the world it should be easy enough
to follow the recipe.
Whip the egg whites until they form stiff
peaks.
Stiff peaks are when you remove the beater
and the egg whites form a peak that doesn’t
fall to the side.
Now with your mixer on a high speed start
to add your sugar about a tablespoon at a
time.
This makes sure all of the sugar dissolves
into the egg whites and if you were to just
pour in the whole lot your egg white would
completely collapse, loosing all of that air.
The meringue should get glossier, fluffier
and brighter white with each tablespoon of
sugar you add.
This is the time where it’s important that
you’ve used a large enough bowl as it will
grow in size considerably.
Don’t rush the sugar, it should take you
quite a few minutes to add it all in.
When all of the sugar has been added beat
the meringue for a further 5-7 minutes on
high speed.
After this time check your meringue.
Take a bit between your fingers and if you
can feel any grittiness from the sugar beat
for another minute and check again.
You want it to be completely smooth as this
means all of the sugar has dissolved.
If you ever make a pavlova and you get that
sugary water that comes out while baking this
is usually because some of the sugar hasn’t
dissolved and is melting in the oven.
The last couple of ingredients we’ll need
are corn flour or corn starch, same ingredient
just different names depending on where you
live in the world, and vinegar.
Turn the mixer off and measure out 2 teaspoon
of the corn flour and add it straight to the
bowl, followed with 1 teaspoon of white vinegar.
Turn your mixer onto high and beat for 30
seconds or so just until the ingredients are
fully incorporated.
Turn your meringue out onto a lined baking
sheet and shape it into a 9 inch or 23cm circle.
This doesn’t need to be exact, just eye
ball it.
You don’t want it to be smooth, this dessert
is the most rustic thing you can think of.
Place the pavlova into a 130C or 260F oven
for an hour and 5 minutes.
After this time turn your oven off and without
opening the door leave the pavlova to cool
completely for about 4 or 5 hours or overnight
is best.
Cooling gradually helps to stop the pavlova
from collapsing.
The pavlova keeps in an airtight container
for about a week.
To serve the pavlova whip up about a cup and
a half of cream.
If you’ve ever had trouble whipping cream
before I have a full video full of tips and
tricks and even how to fix over whipped cream.
Ill have it linked in the description box
below if you’re interested.
Top the pavlova with the whipped cream and
top with fresh fruit.
Traditional is strawberries and kiwi fruits
but pavlova goes with nearly everything so
use your favourites.
I’m going with a mix of in season fresh
berries.
