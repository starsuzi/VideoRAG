thank you for tuning in Jeff Feldman
food safety
education uh today the quickest way or
the most efficient way that I think uh
for dicing a tomato so tomato is washed
hands are washed clean gloves ready to
eat products so I'm going to put this
into a salsa uh so it's a ready to eat
food I have to have Clean Hands Clean
gloves clean knife clean board clean
surrounding area making sure there's no
cross-contamination
chef's knife holding the chef knife in
the pinch method uh the thumb and the
forefinger pinching the blade at the
back and then you wrap the other three
fingers around in order to control kind
of like choking up on a baseball bat so
you have more control same idea if I
hold way back here and I have my finger
up there I get wobbly so pinch
method wrap the fingers and you have
more control
we'll take off the
top we'll take off the
bottom now I'm going to what I call is
roll the Tomato so I only want the skin
at this
point I will use the seeds tomatoes and
other products cost quite a bit of money
uh if you're throwing out over the
course of the year you're wasting money
you're throwing money in the trash
I will use this uh for My Salsa so here
now I divide and conquer making it into
easily controlled pieces I'll start with
the top the only waste I want
is the
core from the
stem that's all the waste that I want
right there everything else I will use
uh because I have to maximize my money
so I make my Julien strips or my long
strips qu in for a small Dice and now I
come back
sideways and I have my small
dice okay same thing on the bottom
there's nothing to waste there so I will
use the entire
product turn
sideways go through 1/4
inch or about a/4 inch
right now I have my skin sides again
just roll through turn
sideways jully
uncut turn
sideways controllable size so if you
have a little too much for your hand
divide it you know push it off to the
side come back to it as soon as you can
get to it it's always about control in
the
kitchen they tease that uh in The
Culinary world that if you use your
wrist as I'm doing to roll the knife you
get carpel
tunnel If instead you use your elbow to
push through you hit 10 elbow so your
choice over the course of 30 years you
probably develop both anyway now for the
seeds Okay so I want that I'll cut it in
half and I'm just going to divide it
down
again Julian turn
it dice it push it down make it
flat go through to the end it's the same
as the skin just a little more
juicy right so I have a little green
piece here that I don't want so I'm
going to cut through that pour that
out turn it on the side pour that
out push
down go back to Julian spin sideways and
dice push down flatten it out
spin sideways and
dice I appreciate you joining me
today on how to dice this beautiful
tomato in a an efficient manner so here
I will bench my knife it's a safety
percussion I will use my bench scraper
to move the product again for safety the
bench scrap zipper is not
sharp if I were using my knife the
potential is to be in a rush and I'll
cut my hand as I move things from here
to there so safety first food safety
kitchen safety practice makes better
thank you very much
