this is going to uh show you how to
remove a vinyl sticker that's been
placed on your car for a little while uh
you really just need some glass cleaner
Windex and just a razor blade it's as
simple as that uh just give it a good
spray glass
cleaner then just take your razor
blade and just slide it behind the
letters comes off just as simple as that
it will leave behind just a little bit
of residue after the first
time so as you can see there's a little
residue here all you have to do is give
it a little another
spray come back again with your razor
blade give it a few scrapes
and that's how you remove it just grab
your
rag wipe it off and
it's gone
