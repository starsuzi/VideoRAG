hi this is evan and jillian welcome back
to part two of our science lab and the
first part we showed you i'm making
bluebird stress i love
vinegar and baking soda we're going to
show you how to blow up a balloon with
the same ingredients here's what you're
going to need baking soda
vinegar
butter bottle
and
first thing you have to do is put the
funnel
into the water bottle
then you have to
put
fill the bottle about halfway
stick the balloon onto the funnel
next thing you have to do is put the
baking soda into the funnel
[Music]
we put three tablespoons into the
balloon
when you put the baking soda in the
balloon it's time for the bottle
don't put the baking soda into the
vinegar yet
time for the safety goggles
[Music]
here we go
dump the baking soda into the vinegar
so
