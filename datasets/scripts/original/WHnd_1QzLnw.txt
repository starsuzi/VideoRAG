okay guys this video is actually to show
you how to
preserve
four leaf clovers mainly
in this video but leaves flowers
anything that
that's organic that you want to preserve
now
what you'll need
is a notebook or paper
anything that's going to end up sucking
up the moisture from these which will
prevent them from drying out and
shriveling and then obviously your
organic material in this case four leaf
clovers
uh that you will be preserving
and i like to have a little toothpick
when it comes to these four leaf clovers
just to
spread out any of the leaves to make
them
lie down a little more flat and
just help out a little bit hopefully we
won't need that but
sorry for the crappy volley
quality of the video but
it's very simple guys all you're gonna
do is take your four leaf over
we're gonna
lay it down
you want to try and lay it down as flat
as you can you don't have to press it or
go crazy
if it's one that keeps falling over
then you could press it down
gently and i try to bend these stems a
little bit i don't break them
but
just so that when you close it
it's not
gonna end up moving it in a bad position
and another thing is uh you have stems
that really stick up
put it towards the opening of the book
this way when you're
actually closing the book it's
gonna it's not gonna fall over as easy
again
if you have
uneven leaves
just use your
toothpick
and then once you got these guys pretty
decent
where's your book see i don't like that
one
again
just
hold it down a little bit
close it
and then you're gonna just take it
and sorry for the absolute mess but i am
not remodeling but uh cleaning up a lot
of the clutter in my room
but sorry this is all one-handed
you're gonna actually
we could
slide it in here at some point
sorry
that i had to put you down
but you're gonna actually just wait it
down so you see it's flat
and then i have a book on top to weight
it down uh
there are other things being weighted
down in there that's why
it's all a jumble
but
and that's it you wait two two days to
a week or two depending on what you're
actually uh
pressing but
that's it and then you take it out and
either make your
craft or
preserve it in a baggie or whatever
you're gonna do with it
thanks for watching
