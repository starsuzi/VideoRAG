hello YouTube
here today to show you something else
hopefully are having a good day and a
good week and ready for the real busy
weekend I know I am so anyways I'm here
today to show you all the catch master
what is the catch master the catch
master is something that helps me from
getting bit by spiders and I'm not
really an arachnophobia
but if you were you'd really want one
but I just don't I'd rather have the
extra security of something catching my
bugs for me so I'm going to show you all
the catch master right here
it folds up see how there's a slot right
there folds up into a little box and
then right from that point you set it by
your doors any openings in the house or
any doorways and it catches spiders for
you right now caught caught us a big
cricket and that's pretty cool I guess I
don't mind crickets
I like crickets better than other
spiders to be honest but let me turn it
around see a big old cricket
around where we live there's a bunch of
brown recluse spiders basically in the
southeast of the United States of
America and so if you if you were to
ever travel around this area if you live
in this area you may want to watch out
for them if you just do a Google or a
Yahoo search for brown recluse spiders
you'll see what I mean you don't want to
get bit by one so basically I'm gonna
fold this trap up and tell you
I followed it up and take it over here
to the door and set her down
right there folks catch your bugs and
that thing is screaming out to the bugs
hey come on in here here's a nice little
place to stay permanently now I'm not
mean to bugs but I just don't want no
brown recluses and I think you know why
so settle down all your animal lovers
I'm not anti animal I'm just anti brown
recluse and it happened to catch a
couple other bugs well if you're upset
about that then get over it because I
ain't getting bit if you want to search
the internet and find out see if you
want to get bit go ahead and do that but
I'm not going to do that so
ah
y'all take it easy and have a good
weekend
