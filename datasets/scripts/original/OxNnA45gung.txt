so today I'm going to be showing you how
to do the super easy super quick
do-it-yourself mercury glass I have six
candle vodes here and the first step is
you take a spray bottle with equal parts
vinegar and water and you're going to
stand at a distance and lightly Mist it
onto the
cups make sure you're not putting too
much
on or when you spray paint it it will uh
end up dribbling down which will kind of
ruin the look that you're going
for so after you've sprayed it with the
water you take your spray paint and
you're going to lightly and in short
bursts spray the
bives you're going to do this a couple
times in a couple coats so don't worry
about it
looking you know super shiny or
reflective right off the bat it's better
to be patient and take your
time than
to Del it with the spray paint all at
once resist the urge
all
right now I'm going to let this sit for
1 minute and then I will spray it with
the water again and spray paint it
again all right I've let them sit for a
minute now and you can see that the
spray paint dries really quickly and
they're already starting to look a
little shiny so I'm I'm going to spray
it with my mix
again again making sure to stay at a
distance and not putting too much on so
that it won't
drip all
right then same thing repeat with the
spray
paint short
bursts so that you're not getting too
many drips

all right now I've completed my second
coat and I'm going to let that sit for 2
minutes all right they've sat for 2
minutes now I will next take the paper
towel and and you're going to lightly
well actually it doesn't really matter
how hard you do it but um start just
blotting your jars uh they are now
pretty much dried to the touch so this
is where your texture comes in it does
not really matter you know how
rough you do it it might just add a
little more
um
detail so I'm going to keep doing this
to all the vases
all right I'm on my last
one um I haven't seen I've used the same
paper towel the whole way through I
haven't noticed a big difference on
whether you need to keep using the dry
part or if you blot with the wet part
that you've done um the rest of the
spots with it doesn't seem to impact the
look at all so you know don't worry
about
using three four five paper towel you
probably can get away with one depending
on how big your project is so I sprayed
it with the spray bottle one more time
and the spray paint uh to get the look
that I wanted I'm now going to just blot
it with the paper towel again and I
think I'll have reached the mercury
glass look that I was going for so all
said and
done I sprayed it with the squirt bottle
three times and I sprayed it with the
kryon Looking Glass spray paint three
times and I blotted it
twice and judging from what I'm seeing
after blotting it I'm pretty sure I got
the look I was going
for
and there you have it do it-yourself
mercury glass really
simple for
