Alright.
I'd like to talk to you very quickly about
using the bar, sometimes called the whammy
bar, sometimes called the vibrato bar.
And it's something that's overdone a lot,
so you have to be careful with it.
I actually stopped using it very early on
in my career.
But, it's fun to play around with it once
in a while, and if you're checking out the
styles of guitar players like Jeff Beck, or
Dave Gilmour, it's an integral part of their
playing.
So what they'll often do is play melodies,
and take a note and just enhance it with the
bar.
Something like.
So there you can really hear the vibrato,
that definitely gives it a vibrato bar feel,
makes it kind of anthemic.
Jimi Hendrix took the bar to whole new places.
He would do a lot of stuff with feedback and
harmonics.
So an example of that is, if we take the natural
harmonics, say on the 7th fret, I can play
with the bar, and it's going to make a really
cool sound.
Check it out.
So that also has to do with the amp feeding
back.
I'm going to just do a couple more examples,
and listen to how the amp feeds back, and
listen to how I take the feedback and use
the bar to enhance it.
And let's see where 
it goes.
Alright, that's it.
I hope you've enjoyed this lesson on the vibrato
bar and the whammy bar.
