one i'm susan alexander
the creator of vermont switzel switzel
is the original energy drink
this is what traditionally dairy farmers
across new england would drink during
the haying season
it would keep them well hydrated while
they worked in the hayfields and the
haymows
our grandfather joseph alexander was a
dairy farmer in glover vermont
where they pitched loose hay onto
horse-drawn wagons they claimed switchel
would slake their thirst
like nothing else we begin making
vermont switchel with the maple syrup
that we produced here on our farm and
cabot
we add lemon juice apple cider vinegar
blackstrap molasses all organic
and ginger root the result
is a thoroughly satisfying snappy ginger
flavor
combined with the sweetness of the maple
syrup
not at all cloying and it has a smooth
finish
that we attribute to the minerals in the
blackstrap molasses
so my journey with switzel started about
30 years ago at a family reunion
we made a batch of grampy switchel and i
remember
saying that day someday i'm going to
bottle this
it was truly love at first sip so
here i am two children and two careers
later
finally getting to the point where i've
decided it's time to share my
switchel take it out of my kitchen and
bring it into your home
while intended to be enjoyed ice cold on
a hot hot day
we also like to heat up switchel with a
little cinnamon
during the winter it makes a lovely mold
beverage
and it plays well with adult spirits as
well
so whether you're just kicking around a
soccer ball or kicking back
switchel is guaranteed to slake your
thirst
we thank you for enjoying our agrarian
heritage
in a bottle cheers american made
