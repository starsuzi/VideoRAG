and here on this brake we have a leaky
brake
situation take a look
at take a look at this wet stuff there
that's not normal I should be dry breake
dust in
here and this wet stuff is smeared on
there
this breake dust
is tolerable
but but
definitely definitely a leak happening
there it's wet there and it's wet
underneath on the
cam and it's not wet anywhere else but
uh this one is leaking somewhere
underneath here just give me a sec
there now it's drip in
see there it's leaking breake fluid now
it's dripping that
okay so this one is not good this needs
to be done
immediately okay and uh it's fairly
straightforward to do
it have to remove this wheel
cylinder and I'm sure it's got some
bolts behind it if I can't see anything
n it's too dark this time of the day
but I'll show you it's fairly
straightforward yeah but that leak is is
there it's obvious I know the Sun is
going down but that's how a minor leak
looks like before it pulls and puddles
anywhere cuz as is it's
fairly tolerable but yeah this one
should be T out of service
