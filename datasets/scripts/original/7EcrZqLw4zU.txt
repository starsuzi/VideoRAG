hi everyone on this episode I'm going to
tape the dry wall on my last video I
pre-fill the gaps in the holes with
topping before I start I'm going to
smooth over all the rough edges with my
drywall sponge don't forget to wear your
[Music]
mask
to tape the drywall we're going to need
a drill to go along with the mixing
paddle some paper
tape a mud pan with a joint
knife allpurpose joint compound and of
course a
[Music]
ladder
[Music]
I'm going to mix up the joint compound
till it's nice and
[Music]
[Music]
creamy
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I'm going to use the joint knife to
apply enough mud to cover the
joint paper tape comes with a crease and
you want to put the crease into the
groove
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay so when you put a corner piece in
you make sure increase it it makes it a
lot easier to put it up against the
wall
I'm going to let the tape dry overnight
and then I'm going to put the next
layer now I'm going to smooth over all
the rough edges with a drywall sponge
just remember we don't want to go over
the tape we don't want to mess it up
we're just going to sand around the
tape
oh okay now we're going to put our first
layer over the
[Music]
tape usually with the butt joint you
want to go out wide but I don't have
enough room because of the window sill
here you're supposed to go down one side
down the other and down the middle but
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to go down the middle
[Music]
so for this Factory seam I'm just going
to go one with
across for the corners I'm going to use
a 5-in joint knife unless you're really
good you should only do one side of of
the corner let it dry and then come back
and do the other side and that's what
I'm going to
[Music]
[Music]
do here again I'm just going to go over
one side and then do the other side
tomorrow once it
dries
[Music]
[Music]
today I'm going to finish the other side
of the corners but first i'm going to
smooth all the rough edges then that got
left behind from
[Music]
yesterday tip you could add a little
water to your joint compound to make it
[Music]
smoother
[Music]
[Music]
today I'm going to be applying the
second layer before I start I'm going to
sand it like I did last time this time
I'm going to be using my sanding
[Music]
pole
[Music]
another way to do the corners is with a
corner
[Music]
[Music]
trout I'm going to let this dry 24 hours
and tomorrow I'm doing the last
layer
[Music]
I just got done sanding I'm on the last
layer today and I'm going to use topping
cuz it's a little easier to
[Music]
sand each layer that you add you want to
Fan out a little further on the last
[Music]
[Music]
one
I'm just going to go for the screws one
more time with
[Music]
[Music]
topping that's it it's not that hard you
just have to have a little patience I'm
going to come back tomorrow and sand
this and then I'll be all
done
[Music]
