welcome back to the tutorial on how to
do the masking tape perler bead method
uh we are at the step where it's already
been taped down
but now we have to puncture holes in
every single bead
this is where your tool comes in handy
whether it be
a paint daughter if it's a
clay stylist or whatever you end up
using as long as it's small enough to go
through the center of each bead
and it's strong enough not to break from
doing that then
you'll be fine but the pain in the butt
part is you have to do this in the
middle of
every single bead otherwise it will warp
when you go to uh when you iron it so
it's a very time consuming part of this
it probably takes more time than
anything else
but on the plus side it's sort of like
popping bubble wrap
i won't show the entire process because
it's very
boring and tedious and takes a long time
but i'll give you the general gist of it
so this is why you have to rub down
the tape on top of it so you can see the
outline of where the beads are
so you just go through and pop
little holes in the center of every bead
just like that you just keep doing it
all over the place you can do them all
in one spot and then jump around
you can go across an
order it doesn't really matter how you
do it all that matters is that you get
all of them
so since the bottom's over here you can
just go along get the beads from the
bottom edge work your way up
work your way across whatever you want
to do it's up to you
doesn't really matter just have to hit
every single
bead i would recommend not using
anything
sharp because you still have your perler
pegboard
on the inside of this and you don't want
to break the pegs
just from puncturing your masking tape
i doubt there's too many things you
would use that actually be sharp enough
to
do that but i don't know
i don't want to be held accountable in
case you somehow mess up your peg board
but
most intensive purposes oops i went in
between needs there but yeah for most
intents and purposes
chances are yeah i'm trying to figure
out why
i feel something sticking out here
something may have shifted
when i pull this up i'll be able to take
a better look at it i think one move
from actually let's just peel this back
yeah one move for the bottom edge so
this is where
the tweezers come in handy you just move
it
right back in the spot where it's
supposed to go
and then tape it back down
and re-puncture it
and you just keep going it doesn't
really matter i mean
if you can't really see where the holes
are it is perfectly
okay and actually recommended
to take whatever tool you're using and
just sort of scratch
over the beads so you can see the
outlines and the indents
of where the centers are and just
go right along and once you can see
where they are it makes things
a hell of a lot easier so just go right
ahead
do your whole design
i think you guys have the general idea
here so
once i have all my holes punctured
i will be back for the next part
