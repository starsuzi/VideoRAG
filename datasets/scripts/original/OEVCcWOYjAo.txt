here's my new experiment I am trying out
making tip wash I don't know if that's
exactly how you pronounce it te PA CH e
and it's basically just the scraps from
a pineapple I cut up a pineapple through
the scraps and some of the fruit in
there I put a cup of sugar some tap
water some ground cinnamon if I had a
cinnamon stick I would have put the
stick in and I put a couple of cloves in
there so now I just let it ferment I'm
going to put that coffee filter and the
rubber band over top of it and I'm going
to put it up there on the fermenting
shelf and put it alongside next to the
other projects and we'll see how it goes
it should take about five days depending
on the temperature of the house so we'll
see how it goes I'll let you know
