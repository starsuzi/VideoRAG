hello and welcome to basic baking with
me a partner today we are going to
discuss how to measure your ingredients
correctly that will lead to a perfectly
baked product here we have some
measuring cups so measuring cup start
from 1 cup then 1/2 a cup 1/3 cup and
1/4 cup now we are going to measure a
measure in one cup so I recommend
filling your cup with a separate school
and avoid shaking it while filling
once you have filled the cup to the top
you have to level it out for this I am
taking a knife rested on your cup edge
and just slide it out this is exactly
one cup of flour now we are going to
measure granulated white sugar
so for this I'm taking 1/4 cup
[Music]
this we can level out by simply leveling
it or shaking the car but I am going to
use again the path of a 9 this is
exactly 1/4 cup of granulated white
sugar a standard 1 cup measure is 240 ml
now coming on to our measuring spoon
they start with 1 tablespoon half a
tablespoon 1 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon 1/4
teaspoon and sometimes 1/8 teaspoon also
so the standard measure for 1 tablespoon
is 15 grams and for 1 teaspoon is 5
grams now let's see how to measure our
liquid ingredients
for this I have a measuring jar that
help marking up to 300 ml but it also
comes up to 500 ml in some of the
measuring charm whenever you are
measuring your liquid ingredients I
recommend keeping your measuring jar on
a stable surface coming down to your eye
level and then pouring your liquid
so here we have exactly 150 ml of milk
this is how you measure your basic
ingredients accurately if you liked our
