Hi, I'm Jessica Hartshorn from American baby
magazine and I'm gonna show you how you can
soup your stroller with all kinds of fun accessories.
First, I'm gonna talk about stroller liners.
There are nice thick pad that you put on the
stroller like this one.
It's reversible and made of memory foam.
So obviously it's gonna give your baby a really
comfy ride in a stroller, but the other big
advantage to buying a stroller liner is that
when you need to clean the stroller seat,
you just pull the liner off and the whole
thing can go into wash.
Next, you can look for stroller toys that
will keep your baby happy and occupy them
a stroller.
There are plenty of toys with a link like
this that will attach to a stroller.
You can also buy links separately, which make
toys of their own or you can use them to attach
other toys.
There are things like portable mobiles that
will attach to your stroller or toy arches
that will go over a stroller and the best
part about stroller toys is your baby can
toss them overboard.
Finally, I'm gonna show you how you can soup
up the back of your stroller.
Most diaper bags are made with a long handle
that will fit over the back of a stroller,
but for any reason your diaper bag is not
matching to your stroller.
You can buy special hooks to attach your diaper
bag.
There is also an accessory called the Mommy
Hook that you can put on the back and you
can use this to hang any kind of purse or
plastic bags from the supermarket.
Just be sure you don't overload the back of
the stroller or it's gonna tip.
And so there you have it, your stroller is
all souped up.
