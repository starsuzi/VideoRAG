hi guys shocks here
ever wonder what to do with all that
extra melted chocolate that you have
left over
after a kitchen project here let me show
you what i did
so i had some extra chocolate from a
project i just did
and i didn't know what to do with it
so i cut out a piece of parchment paper
here
and i spread it out with my little
spatula
and then i sprinkled the leftover salted
almonds that i had
on top of it and popped it in the
freezer
so now we've got like a little chocolate
it's really thin
i mean we're probably gonna eat this but
you can use it on top of
cupcakes and cakes or something if you
wanted to do a
cool garnish but just thought i would
share this little tip with you
a little cup of chocolate bark
just like that
all right see you next time
