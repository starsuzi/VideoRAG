thank you
hey it's Michelle from planning with
mother bird and I'm just gonna shoot a
quick video to show you how you can take
off your Plum paper cover and laminate
it so it's more like an Erin Condren
cover all I've done this is the cover
that's on my plan paper family planner
and I took my pair of scissors and I
snipped it
in between the coils and I cut just to
the little hole I don't know if you can
see that that's the only step that I've
done I'm only doing my front cover
because as you can see in another video
which I'll link down below for you I
have attached a plastic dashboard to my
back cover and so I don't really have
any way of taking that off without
ruining it so I'm just leaving the
Frosted cover on the back of my planner
and just gonna try out laminating this
one for the front
um
I hope to maybe make some of my own
covers so I thought I would try this one
first and see how it went before I
started making some more so I'll show
you what I have as of supplies it's
pretty limited right now
um I have my Scotch brand thermal
laminator I set it on five in
millimeters Plus
the laminating pouches that I'm going to
be using are three millimeters but I
thought
it will be a little bit hotter I don't
know it may not but that's what I
thought it would be if I did it on five
okay so now my laminator is hot while I
was waiting I pulled out two of these
sheets they are like
all open on one side except for there's
one side that's sealed and I'm just
going to carefully try to line up this
cover inside one of them and then feed
it through the machine
so there's my cover in the
laminating pouch I gave myself a little
bit of extra room on the edges in case I
needed it and I just find the sealed
Edge and loaded in
[Music]
so there's my cover in one pouch it's
honestly already better
durability wise
and it's shinier so it makes the covers
colors stand out better for the cover
I'm gonna now trim it down I just have
these little
scissors that I use for cutting washi
tape and stuff I'm just going to cut it
down and then put it in the second pouch
I have it all trimmed out I don't know
if you can see but I trimmed right up to
the edge
of the cover
when I trim the second sheet I think I'm
going to leave a little bit of an edge
so I'm just going to try to do this
one-handed so you can see how easy it is
to load one of these sheets in case
you've never done it you can buy one of
these Scotch laminators at places like
Walmart Target I want to say I paid
about 20 bucks for it and then they sell
like Scotch brand sheets which entire
you so much for school like 200 will
last me the year for 20 bucks I thought
might as well so uh just gonna get this
bad boy out of there I just opened up
the sheets it has two sides one for the
frown for the back I'm just going to
place this in it doesn't really matter
if I line it up exactly I just want to
have a little bit of order all the way
around since I'm going to trim it again
so I have the laminated cover in another
sheet and I'm just going to load it in
[Music]
thank you
so here's my cover and it feels already
I mean it feels stronger definitely to
me
with the second one I even wonder if you
could do a third I don't think I'm going
to but if you wanted to even get closer
to that tin thickness
I'm going to take my scissors and trim a
little bit maybe not even a quarter of
an inch around the outside just because
I don't want to cut into this
seal that it's made
and so I'm going to use my scissors to
trim it out and then I'm going to run it
through the laminator one more time
trimmed just to make sure I sealed all
those edges well so I'll see you in a
sec okay so I've just used my scissors
and cut around the second sheet of
lamination it's really hard to tell on
this video but
um I did leave a little bit of an extra
Edge
away from the cardstock all the way
around
just to kind of protect that seal now
you can still see the little marks
around the punches where I cut it away
from the coil so what I'm going to do
now is use an eighth inch hole punch
this is a Contraption I had it's an
eyelet Setter and it has a hole puncher
on it it's I think it's called a
crocodile or something like that you do
not have to have this but it's just the
eight inch punch that I have
so this one I believe
yeah it's this one right here so you do
not have to have a Contraption like this
you can just buy a simple hole puncher
that's an eight inch size
but I don't have to buy one when I
already had this lying around so I'm
going to take this and punch the holes
right here where they're marked on my
cover now that I have my holes punched
there I'm just going to take my scissors
down here for you I'm just gonna take my
scissors
and cut
right along this line
that I already cut it's just lamination
there
so I'm going to do that for every hole
through that lamination up to where you
punch the hole so I'm going to do that
with both hands and I'll show you again
all of these have been cut it is now
movable
I've created little tabs
so here's my planner and I'm just going
to use my scissors
to run my fingers to poke
this back in between the coil
[Music]
and there you have a finished laminated
Plum paper planner cover since I did not
laminate the back I wanted to show you
this cover what it looks like with the
Frosted
it says the Frosted cover on it here's
just the cardstock
so I mean it is more vibrant and the
colors are much brighter on the front
this is the back like I said and here's
the dashboard I was speaking about
um
which is why see my dashboard I have
in the back which is why I chose not to
laminate my back cover because I did not
have to take that off so the back will
still have the Frosted cover and then
the front
has my newly laminated cover so I hope
you enjoyed this video I apologize that
I shot the whole thing on my phone but
hopefully you get an idea of how simple
and easy it was to take that sucker off
and laminate it so thanks for watching
bye
