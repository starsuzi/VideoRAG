I steal from Planet Hoke have you had a
little bit of a frustrating time trying
to get old blu-tac out of your carpet I
find quite a bit of this and as you can
see after a while it turns quite black
and it's really hard to get out so what
I've done is what I've warmed up a
little bit of white vinegar in this jar
in the microwave I've got a kitchen
knife to scrape it off let's see if we
can get it off it actually comes off why
well it's just coming once you think
you've got all you need is your old town
it's nice and dry
and your habit he's all clean again
thanks for watching
