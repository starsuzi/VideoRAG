Oh no what have I done.
Ahh good day everyone
and welcome to today's video where, we are going to be deep-frying random foods. Now, I don't normally eat fried foods but uh
today we're going to change that because I'm going to be deep-frying some really yummy foods like Oreos,
Starburst, gummy worms, and
popsicles. So, if you're excited about this video and you're curious what deep-frying these foods is gonna be like hit that like button.
Let's see if we can get this video to
50,000 likes! Go ahead and hit it right now, I'll wait  for you, go ahead. I'm waiting.
Click it or ticket. Okay, anyways, let's get on with the video.
Let's do it! Okay, so, I pre-made some batter um which it looks weird because it's made with gluten free flour,
not that it really matters because it's still gonna be deep-fried, but that's all I had so it looks a little brown and not the  most pretty.
Okay, so, we are just going to get started with
Pumpkin Spice Oreos. It's fall
so pumpkin spice everything is coming out. So,
let's try these I've never had a, deep-fried Oreo before so this will be interesting.
Mmh, actually it smells pretty good.
I smell the pumpkin and I smell the spice.
Okay! So, I got myself an oven mitt and some tongs, and we are gonna just dip these Oreos into the batter and
into our Fry-a-nator. Alright, let's do this thing!
Okay, so I'm just gonna take the Oreo  with the tongs and just, like, dip it into the batter and just, like,
move it all around...
Get it all nice and good like.
There we go! Let's drop it in.
(Gasp) Wow!
I don't even know how long I'm supposed to put it in there for! Oh, she's sizzling away.
I think it's done.
It doesn't look that pretty because it's the gluten-free thing.
But, let's just put it off to the side. We'll put it on our lovely plate.
Mmm doesn't that look good. Okay! Up next are
Starburst! So, let's unravel these bad boys... I've never seen deep-fried Starburst before
Ummm so I feel like they could be really good. Are they going to be oowegoowe on the inside, like, are they going to be melted? Lets do a pink one.
Alright! Come on little Starburst. You're going in there... Mmmm delicious. This is so weird.
There you go!
That's really weird, this is the strangest thing I think I've ever done.
Okay, we'll just let her sizzle. I don't think we really need to close it because it doesn't need to be in there that long.
Weird, you can kind of see some of the pink peeking through.
I don't know it's like melting
or what's going on I think it's melting. It's melting on the inside there. Okay let's take it out before it like fully melts.
Hardened Up. Oh my god.
Ewwww it has like little legs , oh that's weird. It did melt!
Oh that's Gonna be so freakin yummy. Okay, we'll just hold that off to the side.
All right let's move on to our next one.
Okay, so up next are some gummy
wormmyanias and I'm gonna do two right next to each other, just
to make it a little thicker. So let's just hold these in there,
Let's get them nice and battered.
They're no longer conjoined.
Okay.
That's sick.
Come on stop dripping I need to put you in the Fry-a-lator. Alright. Ready.
Steady
Go
That's weird, that looks like a frickin poop, a fried poop, gummy poop.
I wonder if the gummy is gonna melt inside there. What's going on, hello,
anything cool happening in there? Are the gummies melting? Oh, it's kind of sticking to the bottom of it, oh
Hello, oh no!
Sick! Oh gosh, we have ourselves a situation here.
Get out, quick, while you still can.
Okay, so that's what happens when you do that with gummies.
Okay, so the gummies, clearly, did not work as well as the Oreo or the Starbursts. Hence why
there probably aren't fried gummy worms. Last but not least, are
popsicles. Now, I've heard of like fried ice cream
but I've never heard of fried popsicles. So, we're gonna see if it's just the same thing or if this is basically just gonna melt
instantly. I feel like we'll have to do it very very quick, like a quick little dip in there. Batter her up.
It's like a corn dog but a popsicle. Wow, it does look like a freaking corn dog. Let's just,
lets get right in, oh.
It's not fully in you need to be fully covered.
Get down there.
Okay, let's be quick, oh Gosh
I have so many gummy things on this.
Agh! Oh no!
What have I done?
I don't know what I did wrong,
but I did something very very wrong there. Okay, so now it's time for the grand old taste test.
We're gonna start with the Oreo. Now it's cooled off quite a bit so, here we have it.
Let's Just bite on in.
That's frickin good.
Look at the inside, oh my gosh fried Oreos. Uh-uh.
That's frickin delicious.
That's dangerous. That's real frickin dangerous. So now this is our Starburst, which as
we saw melted. Alright, let's try it.
It was like an ooey gooey Starburst with a crunchy outer layer. That was something. That was good.
Yay! I discovered something. Okay, now I'll try the gummy worm which is still. She's still not doing so
well. She tried. She
tried her best.
Nuh- huh. Ugh.
Don't try that at home kids. That's not good. It was very ooey gooey, the texture was just disgusting and slimy.
It was like a big ol'
snot, ugh.
Okay, last but not least is the popsicle.
Girl, you probably had it the worst. You were squealing, and hooting, and hollering in there, but let's see how you taste now.
It just tastes like a popsicle. I mean it kind of tastes a little different, like a little battered. Girl,
she's the battered wrapped up in batter. It's pretty good though, so overall Oreo A plus.
Second, definitely the Starburst and the other two just kind of failed badly, but anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this video. If you
did and you want to see another one where I deep-fry other things. Give this video a thumbs up and if it hits
50,000 I will do another one of these. Another
reminder is that I am going on a book tour October 3rd. I'm going all across the U.S.
