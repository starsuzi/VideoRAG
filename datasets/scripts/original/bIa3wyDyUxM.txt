what Evan who do you need all that
cheese for haha some of you might know
some of you are gonna find out blamer
I've never made this before and I'm
supposed to have some sort of silicone
baking liner but I I also don't have a
top of my head cheese cheese cheese okay
see how this goes all right five minutes
on the clock see what it looks like
great it's been six minutes seven
minutes man that looks pretty good
well I mean eight minutes okay smoking
we got to get it out of there putting up
a deed what update day Oh was that me
okay like seven minutes next time daddy
another option is I could have made it
into like squares and it would have
crystal a little better wonder what the
center will taste like as compared to
like these crispy edges I think I'm
gonna wait till on to let it cool down I
think it'll get stuck Oh

harbajan whole thing that I made
- like 25% of it hey this little baggie
how many calories is it Evan the block
previously laid one point four nine
pounds so put it on this handy-dandy
scale one pound four point three ounces
which is approximately one in a quarter
pound so I made a quarter pound of
cheese and that would mean that I got to
read this part now 28 grams is 110
calories and I don't know grim two pound
ratio so I've got to look that up to
make it easier on myself I just switched
to grams so this was one and a half
pounds I used a quarter pound so that
means I used a fifth of it so this
number times 0.2 zero
like 100 grams and the serving is only
28 so let's say it would use four
servings so that's like four hundred
something calories okay final weigh-in
400 something calories that's a lot
don't eat it in one sitting
I'm gonna check my math
