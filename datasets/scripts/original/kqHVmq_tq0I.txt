hi guys my name is sumair and welcome to
matt's workshop today i'm going to make
a 30x incubator
manual incubator so that's starting from
the sizes this is a door which is like
13.5 inches to
one feet 12 inches and this one is
16 inches by 5 inches of two pieces
and this one is 5 inches by
12 inches of two pieces and this one
is for the panel and it is one uh
12 inches by four inches
and for the back side i'm going to use
this hard board
i'm going to make holes for
this one this part small part of the
side so let's make it only
sides are ready now i'm going to put the
panel over here first of all
now it's time to put the bag on it
alright so our body is ready now i'm
going to put
the door so i'm using this
hinge
all right i'm using this cover line for
the edges of the
this box
so the box is ready fully ready and
we need a milk holder bulb
and a 220 filling
and this is w1209
thermostat temperature controller
so let's start this
first of all
[Music]
from this measurement
which was one wire i operated it from
the center and it come to two
i haven't touched that wire
and it is going to be in
this folder right here
all right so i have
started it inside of it
this edge of the wire will be attached
to
this one plug
and this wire is going to be
those two wires are going to in the k 0
and k
1 of it folder inside of the panel
there it is
from which the relay wire will be come
out from the first one
[Music]
and this thing i am going to power up
this
circuit it works on 12 part so
obviously i have to make another wire
and put it right back
for the 12 part uh i'm using this coil
for
one or two amperes adapter
and i'm going to connect this edge from
here
and i'm going to power this
and this fan both from this adapter
so i have to make two of the wires
to be attached like this
all right so the 12 volt power is ready
i'm going to connect this to this one
and it will be outside and it will this
one will be
power this and this one will power the
[Music]
fan
i have put this fan on the stick and i
have
kind enough with the zip ties and the
bulb is over here
it's not touching any surface so
i have cut it out these parts by
measuring inside of the
and it will be inside of this it will be
a tray where the eggs will be
put it up
it will be sitting on it like that so i
am going to put it over here
two of them like this way and it will
[Music]
turn
is ready i'm using this aluminum
metal tape for putting up the water so
you have to put the water in here so
there's the
heat source and this is the fan is going
to suck up
all the heat being uh make here and it
will
throw it over here as soon as it will
hit this
it will create a worm and it will create
a humidity and it will turn on over here
and there will be a x over here
and the sensor will be over here with
the x
and one last thing we have to do is to
make some holes for
the fresh air to get in
so the
spot where i have to make the hole is
over here because
this part we have a fan and we'll suck
a fresh air and gather the heat
and it will grow over the eggs so this
is the part where i have to make some
holes
one time it is 50
always 38
and press the set button until you get
p0
and you get the p0 and press the set
again it is cooling
i have we don't want cooling your part
it's
hot right now and again we are going to
p1
i am going to put it p
over here let's see what's from here
bulb is on it have
forced the bulb to be on
when it reaches 38 it will turn on the
heat source
when it reach 37 it will turn on the
bulk
again so let's see it is working
perfectly
[Music]
