so hi this is an 8-bit farm chick and
this is my sweet Lola was about six and
a half maybe seven months old and hot
today
South Florida 96 right now they say so
sadly Lola had like a parasite infection
and took her to the vet
medicated and she's got there a couple
things and
feeling so much but somewhat better but
now with the integration of the new baby
chicks into the coop I don't know if
she's overwhelmed but her energy level
has gone back down a bit and she's still
suffering from tasty bug which is a very
disgusting thing and you really got to
love your chicken to take care of it I
mean you want to keep your life so I'm
going to show you a slightly graphic
picture of what she has right now and
this is just from two days of not
claiming it she's been okay with that
but I noticed this morning there was a
bunch and I think because she did not
get up and move around in the coop last
night that she's got a lot more than
normal so prepare yourself is not a
pretty picture
this here is a pasty but and you can see
the Flies and that's I don't know how
close this is but we are going to take
care of this now I left some water here
harkishen wants to get a drink and I'm
going to put my gloves on and get a
towel handy wipes I've got a little flea
comb to comb the feathers out and so I
have already mixed some Epsom salt into
the warm water here
too far away so I'm going to adjust the
camera
and you don't know if that helps because
this is my first time using Tom's camera
so I'm going to go ahead and put the
water in the little tub here that she
doesn't like that but it has to be done
and this water is going to get pretty
grody
so basically obviously you don't want it
too hot and this is definitely not too
hot but this is horrible two days work
and that's what's showing so you just
kind of get him in there and just have
her sit a bit and let the BC soften and
kind of give her a little swish around
and sometimes go back there and basic
massive dingleberry situation back here
but the warm water little agitation with
your fingers will loosen it up and I
think she's so tired she doesn't have
much fight in her but I feel a little
something now it's like what are you
doing to me
what am i doing and there goes Lucy you
might have seen her in the background so
there is more and takes a bit to coming
off pretty easy for a while there last
week all her poop had a yellow tint to
it
I looked everything up online and
different things could have been
possible like she might have actually
tried to create an egg and I was worried
she was egg bound which she would have
died within 48 hours if she was but I
massaged the area and I think what
happened was an egg didn't didn't fully
develop inside her and so it was the
yolk which is the initial stage of
making an egg I think the yolk part just
kept coming out until it worked through
her system so now I've got a disgusting
a little pool here but as you can see a
little wet but but it just kind of comes
off pretty good you got to get in there
you gotta get up and close and so this
handy dandy flea comb can help pull out
some of the other stuff
this is probably the grossest video I'll
ever make in my life but you love your
pets you got to do what you got to do so
it's my baby my little baby
and she hates me for it but you have to
really check the vent which the vent is
this little area up here it's like a
sighting if you can see it but that is
event and down below this dark area
which at first I thought was poof that's
actually a belly button
who would have thought that chickens
have belly buttons so I'm going to
continue cleaning in here and it doesn't
smell good
nunu so I'm so sorry baby
I know she's trying to fight but she
really doesn't know me so I don't like
this okay stop so actually only forward
half of the water and because what I
want to do is do a second batch so I'm
gonna pour out that first nasty batch go
ahead and for the next batch in to see a
little more off closer around the one of
the water is still warm it's okay baby
I think she might actually be cooler
than the rest of chickens because she
gave little mana so
okay so gotta pull off the
reach everything later so try to go
through just comb around the area make
sure you get everything
she's not happy okay I'm sorry baby
okay I know I'm gonna get you clean
I know you want to peck at me but you're
doing happy in her chance I know let's
just make sure I think you're just about
clean there's just a tiny bit more and
you don't want to tilt your chicken too
much could then
let's see what we have going on in here
and I find that combing the feathers out
helps them dry a lot better a lot
quicker
we really hate walking around with like
getting that haircut by your mom could
you hate second grade picture day she
decides to become a hair stylist sends
you to school with a haircut it looks I
keep it full on her head like everybody
experience that I did wish I could show
you a flash my second grade picture yes
funny thing is my brother and I took
exactly the same she allowed his hair to
be long
she kept lying
don't use the same bowl so okay so we're
down to the nitty-gritty here sometimes
a little feathers come out
you want it absolutely clean sick and
really see how often
there's sorry baby girl I'm so sorry
so do a little inspection here dollars
stuffs hard to get yeah you dry out okay
home out okay okay yeah she's ready to
kill me but
I know she's attacking Vidia off here
more harder
