welcome to Discount Graphics
instructional video on how to remove a
vinyl decal today we are going to show
you how to remove a vinyl decal using a
heat gun this method works well in most
all
conditions you can find a lowcost te gun
at most home improvement stores they
also sell at places like Harbor Freight
tools for around $10 each the heat gun
works best on metal or glass surfaces
for removing
decals to start aim your heat gun at the
decal and begin to heat the surface
across the decal some stubborn areas may
require more heat than others
once you have heated the area start
using your fingernail to lift up a
corner of the
decal then begin to pull up the decal at
an angle if the decal is not hot enough
to to release the decal easily from the
surface simply heat the area again and
repeat continue removing the section as
needed the removal as you can see
is much easier than using a
scraper scrapers can scratch the surface
when removing decals and is not
recommended they also leave behind the
adhesive residue that can be hard to
remove using the heat gun reduces the
amount of adhesive left behind
for
once you have completed removing all the
vinel then use a rag and rubbing alcohol
to clean the
surface rubbing alcohol will break down
the remaining adhesive and clean the
area better than other cleaners will
using alcohol keeps the surface free of
oil and residues left over from some
cleaners this completes the removal of
your vinyl
decal for more videos related to the
