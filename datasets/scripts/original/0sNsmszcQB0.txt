in this video I'm going to change out a
toilet seat uh I just did a video on
replacing a toilet but I didn't actually
have the seat handy at the time so uh
basically what you have here I'm going
to take this seat off of the old toilet
cuz it was fine you have a nut on the
bottom of the toilet and up on top these
covers you
just pop them out you can see there's a
flathead screwdriver in there gloves are
always handy to have for something like
this so what we're going to do is hold
that nut on the bottom and put a
flathead screwdriver in the
top so with your flathead
screwdriver in the top holding that
plastic
bolt just
reach
underneath should be able to do this
they're generally only hand tight but if
not just get a wrench of some kind hold
that nut on the
bottom unscrew
that like
so and then that just pops right into
there do the same thing on the other
side to install the new seat
let take the
seat slide it in
place over the
holes you can either depending on where
you want to position the seat on the
toilet line up the
forward or the holes that are towards
the
back slip
the bolts
down through the
top and then we got to place the uh nuts
on the underside of the toilet to match
up with those
bolts so here we can see the bolt
underneath of the uh toilet
seat take your
nut screw that
on go over to the other side put the nut
on over there and then just go once you
get it
tight Fair bit of thread on these so you
can see that goes up quite a ways and
just do the same thing on the other side
and then just go back and forth from one
to the other tighten them up until
they're uh
snug once you have the nut and the bolt
hand tight just to get a little extra on
on it hold the uh nut from down below
underneath the toilet bowl here have
your Screwdriver from the top and just
snug it up a little
extra pull over to the other
side do the same
thing I'm holding the nut from the
bottom turn the screw a bit there on the
top got to make sure that everything is
good and tight there
maybe a little extra on this
one and then basically
just snap your little covers down in
place all they do is co cover the
uh the bolt hole
there this one actually is a
uh recycled toilet seat from the old one
so it snapped off there but anyway just
push that into
place and that's it
for changing go the toilet
seat
