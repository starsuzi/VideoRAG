Hello everybody welcome back this is
Sarah today I'll be trying out another
Nickelodeon slime kit this is the slimy
Extravaganza lab now I know I have
showed you guys one of these kits before
but this one is a little bit different I
picked it up at Target and retails for
about
$20 the slime in this one is a little
bit different than the previous one this
one includes silly slime glow and the
dark
slime foam and party slime neon slime
scented slime and Galactic glitter
slime so let's get this box open and see
what they've included
[Music]
inside so here's all the materials that
they've included inside they give you
two bottles of white school glue two
bottles of clear
glue two plastic mixing bowls a bag of
slime making
powder a bag of foam
beads several different colors of
paint some glow-in-the-dark
paint two bottles of scents they give
you a cotton candy and a green apple in
this one some storage containers for
your finished
slime oh and here's some lids for those
containers some wooden popsicle
sticks a measuring
cup a plastic
spoon some plastic googly
eyes four different types of
glitter oo
pretty and of course some instructions
on how to make all those different
slimes
all right guys let's get
started for this first slime I'm going
to be making one of the neon colored
ones so I'm going to put 10 mL of white
glue into my mixing
[Music]
cup then I'm going to measure 30 mL of
water and also add that to the the
glue then I'm just going to mix those
two together really really
well for this neon slime I'm going to
make this one a neon
[Music]
pink now I'm going to mix the paint into
the glue and water mixture really really
well
now I'll grab my second mixing
bowl I'll be adding two scoops of this
lime making
[Music]
powder along with 15 mL of hot
water I'm going to mix the powder in
really well to the water and make sure
that it's fully
dissolved now the last step is to add
that into my first
bowl and it should start to make some
slime you just have to keep mixing until
it gets thicker and
[Music]
thicker that looks pretty good
ooh how pretty is this color of slime I
love the pink
now as you continue playing with this it
should become a much better slime as you
can see it's already thickened up quite
a bit from when I took it out of the
mixing
bowl this is rubbery I like
it I also like the fact that it's not at
all sticky
[Music]
now when you're done making the Slime it
fits nicely right inside one of the
storage cups that way it doesn't dry
out let's make another slime
[Music]
this time let's make a slime that glows
in the dark
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now for the test let's see if it glow
clows in the
dark yes it sure
does oo that's creepy that looks like a
[Music]
face Yay this slime was a success let's
make one more
[Music]
[Music]
this one came out pretty good I like the
texture of the
Slime I added some green paint and some
of the googly eyes to make the silly
slime you could use any color with this
particular one I chose green because it
reminded me of a
monster
[Music]
ooh all right guys those are just three
of the slimes you can make with this kit
tomorrow I will post the second part of
this video where I make the rest of the
slimes so guys be sure to subscribe and
stay tuned for that thank you so much
