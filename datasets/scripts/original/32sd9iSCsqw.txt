Today, I will show you how to make Plain Curds!
For that, we need only milk and little curds.
Pour the milk in a deep pan and boil on a medium flame for 
 1 to 2 minutes or till the milk is lukewarm, while stirring occasionally.
If the milk is too hot while making the curds, 
 then water will ooze out of the curds.
Switch off the flame and keep aside. 
Now, Spread the curds evenly at the bottom of a deep bowl.
Check whether the milk is not enough. It should be lukewarm.
Setting time of the curds varies in summer and winter. In 
 summer, it may set faster as compare to the winter.
When you making the curds in winter season, 
 make sure you cover the vessel properly.
Mix well.
Cover with a lid and keep aside in a warm place 
 for 4 hours or till the curds set. 
Refrigerate and use as required.
