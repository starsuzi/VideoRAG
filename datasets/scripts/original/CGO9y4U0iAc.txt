hello this is how to bob and in this
video i'm going to show you how to make
rainbow flames in your campfire
start out you're going to need a piece
of garden hose
and a copper pipe
what you do with the copper pipe is you
drill holes at random around the outside
of it and you take your regular old
garden hose the ones with the fiberglass
reinforcement are probably the best they
get the best coloring and what you do
with the garden hose is slide it inside
just push it inside the pipe now this
pipe is about
15 years old and it's been through many
fires so this will this is what it's
going to look like after a few fires and
once you do that you just toss it in the
fire that's already going and you'll get
rainbow colors like this
if you do use your campfire for cooking
i highly recommend that you do your
cooking before
you put the copper pipe with the
garden hose in it because of the
chemical reaction that's occurring in
the fire to make these colors
now in this part here i went ahead and
took the copper pipe out just so you can
see that it is glowing
hot so be very very careful
and as for the garden hose you can
usually find those on garbage night if
you drive around you'll find an old one
that somebody's discarded
so you can have fun with the colors in
this this is how to bob
thanks for watching
