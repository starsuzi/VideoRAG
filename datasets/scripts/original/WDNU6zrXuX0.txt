stop before beginning any repair always
be sure to disconnect the power to the
Appliance it is also recommended to test
the outlet for proper
voltage tools needed for this repair is
a putty knife a tack puller or flat
blade screwdriver and a/ Quin nut
driver okay what we're on is a Whirlpool
topload washer what it's not doing is
it's not uh finishing Cycles so what
we're going to do is start with in
diagnostic mode the way you achieve that
is you go clockwise or counterclockwise
once and then clockwise three clicks
counterclockwise one click back to uh
counterclockwise one click and then to
put it in um to see what the fault codes
are you're going to uh rotate it until
it says done and then you hit the start
button and then you rotate another click
to see if there's any fault
codes and right now there is no fault
codes in this machine what we did is we
reference a service pointer on this
particular model and uh what that
indicates is that the board uh
programming is bad so what we're going
to do is uh replace the board today
first I'm going to remove a screw in the
back it's a/ Quin screw then I'm going
to take the knob
off I'm going to take a putty knife and
I'm going to there's two clips I got to
release those clips so I
can the
console tip it back and then here's the
board so I can replace
it okay to replace this board first what
I'm going to do is I'm going to take all
the the connectors off
I'm going to remove the two screws from
the side
to remove the
board now with the new board we're going
to install it you put your clip in
there put the two screws back in and
then you start hooking up all your
connections they only go one way so
there you can't mess them up
okay what we're going to do is put the
console back on what we do is rotate it
put the Clips in the holes and then push
down and now it's attached all we need
to do now is put the knob back
on and the screw that we took out from
the
back now we're going to put it back into
diagnostic mode and we're going to
recalibrate after doing the board it's
very important that you do this so again
you rotate it counterclockwise once
clockwise three times counterclockwise
once and clockwise one
more and to put it in calibration mode
what you're going to do is you're going
to rotate the knob until only the rinse
light is displayed you hit start it's
going to take 3 to 5 minutes for the
calibration mode to uh complete
[Music]
and with that calibration is completed
and this will finish your
repair thank you for watching another
