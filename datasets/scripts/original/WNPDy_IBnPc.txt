you can make a very nice Newton's Disc using
an old CD, a marble, a card sheet and some
sketch pens. take a card sheet and make a
hole in the middle and draw all the seven
colors of the rainbow on it. the colors should
be interspersed with white color. then take
an old compact disc, an old CD, and apply
rubber adhesive on top. take your color disc
and stick it on the CD, smooth it out. then
take a marble and lift the CD and apply a
little bit of rubber adhesive in the hole
at the center. then place the marble in the
hole. wait for a while for the marble to dry.
now your disc is ready to spin. this is the
back side. if you spin it on a smooth floor.
it would keep spinning for a very very long
time, all the colors will coalesce and you
will see a greyish white. the CD spins on
the marble for a very very long time. its
got a low center of gravity. has a large moment
of inertia, so spins for a very very long
time.
