hey guys it's Mia and today's video will
be a little bit different
unfortunately I can't film a braid
tutorial for you guys today
because I broke my finger and it makes
it pretty difficult to braid and I
didn't always think that a tutor would
be the best thing to film today so I
decided that I would show you guys how I
wash my mannequins hair is a means of
what has I've watched my videos before
you may notice my mannequins hair is
shorter and it was before and that's
because I cut it and if you actually
like a video on how to cut your
mannequins hair or anyone's hair really
then comment down below and I'll be sure
to make that video the next time that I
cut her hair
so what I'm Eddie wash Mario is is what
grab a shampoo and I'm using my
conditioner by running the water on our
head
so now it's shampoo time
okay now that I shampoo our hair I'm
going to what ring do it again

I'm not going to use too much condition

conditioner
