we're about to do some upholstery
cleaning on our lounge with the sv8d
i just wanted to show you the clean
water that we're starting off with you
only need a very small amount of water
and we'll go ahead and do some cleaning
and then we'll have a look at the
watercolor when we're finished we're
using the sp8d with the
detergent injection to give our lounge a
clean
and
i just wanted to show the
dirt that it's actually pulling out of
the fabric
i'm
amazed actually the lounge is a few
years old and we haven't had it clean
before
but we realized we
our dogs had a few fleas so we decided
to get the sdhd out to
go over our upholstery and carpet in our
lounge area
and thought we'd give the upholstery a
decent clean while we were doing it
and
you can see that
it's actually really
dirty you don't notice it so much
because of the color of the lounge but
seeing what's coming out of it
you realize
how much dirt is actually engrained into
the fabric
it's doing a great job
let's have a look at the watercolor
the actual water that's come out of
cleaning that cushion
and as you can see it's it's actually
pulled a lot of dirt out of that one
cushion
so it is quite dirty which
yeah
feels nice to be able to see
um how much dirt is actually out of it
wasn't nice to see how much was in it
just have a look at the water as we pour
it down the sink from the cleaning the
cushion on the lounge
yeah that's pretty dirty
yeah
yeah
