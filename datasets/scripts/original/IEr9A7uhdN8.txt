hi my name is Brian with Ace Appliance
in Toledo Ohio and welcome back to
another quality video from applian
video.com right we have a Kenmore
topload washer and the complaint is that
it stops in the rinse cycle and won't
advance um or it won't spin so uh the
first thing uh that I noticed when we
open the lid here is I don't hear um the
sound of the lid switch clicking usually
when you open and close this lid you'll
hear the switch clicking on and off or
open and close um so if we look here um
where our lid switches in the back right
corner here um if you take something and
and press down in there uh you can just
see that it's it's not it's not
springing back uh up and down when you
push it down and that it's just not
clicking so
um by feel of it you can just tell that
it's broken so um what we're going to
have to do is replace our lid switch to
repair a washer the tools needed for
this repair are a Phillips screwdriver a
flathead screwdriver and a 516 snut
driver all right the first thing we'll
have to do is access our lid switch
harness inside the console here so what
we're going to do is uh both of our end
caps here we're just going to take the
take and pry on the top to remove
the tabs that release the end
caps and then underneath there there's
going to be two filli screws down at the
bottom to
remove and now we can uh Slide the the
bottom of the console towards us and
then lift up and it's hinged so we can
uh flip it up and then this right here
is going to be our lid switch harness so
we're going to unplug our lid switch
harness all right next thing we got to
do is remove our two clips that hold our
cabinet in place all right uh and then
the one on the right side as well just
insert your screwdriver here uh push
your screwdriver towards the back which
releases the clip towards the front and
removes it from the cabinet all right so
now we can remove the cabinet from the
base
uh we're just going to pull the top of
the cabinet off like this and lift up
the
bottom slide it
out like
that all right so underneath here
there's one screw that we got to take
out for the ground
wire and then our wires for our lid
switch are held in um a clip that's on
the bottom here so we're going to pull
the clip
out here and release our
wires there's also a clip on the back
side here for the other
wires so now we got all that loosened
here our harness that goes up through
the cabinet here there's just two tabs
to push in on either side of it and it
will release it down and out there and
then um inside of uh here when we open
the lid up you'll see the two Phillips
head screws that you have to
remove to unmount the lid
switch now we can remove our old lid
switch all right this is our new lid
switch um and this is the conduit that
the wires go through the switch we're
going to match up our old one with the
new one you can see our old one is much
smaller uh for the conduit so they have
a a breakoff point on the new one uh
this works for a couple different styles
short or long on the Conduit so we're
just going to snap that off there to
make it the right
length and remove the
extra and now we can install our lid
switch onto the cabinet all right so
install our new lid switch first thing
I'm going to do is uh take the harness
and push it up through the cabinet it's
a keyed so it's only going to go up
there one one way and next uh starting
from that point the next uh location for
our job here would be to um put these
wires into our clip
here and then the next uh spot is over
here our other clip for the
conduit snap that behind the clip
there and now we'll go ahead and attach
our our ground screw
our
5/16 M driver all right we'll install
our ground wire with our 5/16
screw and now we can mount our Li switch
in
place right there all right we're going
take a lid switch here uh these are
where the two screws go in uh through
the two screws of the cabinet here and
this is the switch part of it when our
lid closes the actuator hits the switch
and um closes the switch so we'll put
that in
place install our two
screws now next we can reinstall our
cabinet onto the base and you're going
to line up um there's a tab at the
bottom of the base uh in some notches
that the cabinet's going to go on so
you're going to slide it underneath the
front lip and onto the Side
Tracks or the side part of the cabinet
there and then uh kind of tip it like
that with the back the front tipped out
and the back tipped
up and then bring it down into
position to sit onto the
cabinet all right and with that in
position you can take your two clips
insert it into the back panel first and
then push it down into the holes of the
cabinet we
removed left and right
side uh and then we can put our wire
harness back into our new uh lid switch
harness there's a tab here that will
lock into place on the tab there push it
in make sure it clips and locks into
place where you can't pull it back
out and then we can uh bring our control
panel back down we on the control panel
there's going to be tabs two tabs on
each side that'll line up with the holes
on the uh top of the cabinet
there so you'll line those up push it
down and and push it back you shouldn't
be able to lift it up now and your screw
holes will line up if you line that up
right we can go ahead and put our screws
back
in all right we can to put our plastic
endcaps back in place um I'm going to
insert the top of them first and then
snap the bottoms into
place or you can uh you can also insert
the
bottom first and then snap the top into
place actually that's what I prefer to
do is SN is uh the bottoms first and
then snap the tops into place to it's a
little bit easier that way so all right
now uh we got it all back together and
you can hear when we open and close the
lid you'll be able to hear the click of
the
switch we go ahead and uh fill it up and
run it through a test cycle thank you
