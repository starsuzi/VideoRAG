what you want to take note of is this
little Notch you'll know when you've got
the proper tension that you're squeezing
hard enough right when that goes in
that's when you stop as soon as it hits
that Notch so you don't continue to
squeeze after that so right here that's
not enough keep squeezing right to that
point so that's when you know you have
proper tension so my you want to do the
honors got to take your shirt off
buddy so for men the three different
sides the first is going to be at an
angle on the side of your chest halfway
in between your nipple yeah I said
nipple and your armpit
so the first thing that I'm going to do
I'm going to probably turn this way a
little so they can see so like I said
it's that angle right there halfway in
between and what I'm going to do is
pinch vertically at that
angle and here's the important thing
with a
pinch start nice and wide and you want
to dig down until you feel your
fingertips hitting the muscle why that's
because you want to pull the fat away
from the muscle it's going to not hurt
but you can feel the tension a little
bit so you want to make sure that you
pull the fat away from the muscle you
don't want to squeeze the muscle
otherwise you're going to get a bad
reading so once you do
that make sure that you get the calipers
close to your fingertips just about a
centimeter away from your
fingertips and we're going to
squeeze I'm at a bad angle here so I
can't really see let me flip it
[Music]
around 22 now you want to do this three
separate times and you want to take the
average of all three so the first one
was
22 pull it away from the
muscle get close to my
fingers's about
21 one more
[Music]
time about 21 now we're going to move on
to the
[Music]
abdomen what we want to
do is we're going to come about an inch
over from the belly button and we're
going to squeeze vertically now you want
to do the same thing you want to make
sure that you pull away from the muscle
right next to the
[Music]
fingertips like
29 do a second
time
29 and the third
[Music]
time
29 so for men we've got one more
location
and that is the front of the thigh so
Mike pke your shorts up
buddy
so again this is going to be a vertical
pull and you want to do it halfway up
the
thigh so the same thing you want to pull
the fat away from the
[Music]
muscle 20 all
right so here's the difference
between men and women men turn to the
front we do the abdomen on women we go
right above the iliac crest so that
would be that bone right here that's
your hip bone that's the easiest way to
explain it but not on the side we want
to come more towards the front and this
too as an angle but a slight angle like
this so what we're going to do is we're
going to take a pinch right here so for
women it's the iliac crest or right
above it's probably about an inch above
the iliac
crest and you're going to take your
caliper reading just like that so it's
not
vertical it's not horizontal it's at a
slight angle there so that's one of the
locations for females now the second
location is the same for men and women
and that's going to be the middle of the
thigh but instead of doing the chest for
women might turn
around
yeah you're going to do the back of the
tricep so halfway in between the
shoulder and the elbow will take a
vertical pinch just like that so for
women it's going to be the tricep it's
going to be above the iliac crest and
the thigh now here's one thing try to
take it all from the same side of the
body so you notice I took it from the
right side of his hip the right tricep
and right thigh I you could do the left
for whatever reason I don't remember the
exact reason it's recommended that you
do it on the right side I don't think it
really matters just be consistent it's
either the right or pick the left one or
the other so put your shirt back
on we'll go ahead and go to
numbers in punch these numbers in we're
going to go to sixpack university.com
