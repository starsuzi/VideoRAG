hey you guys okay it's me Kiana coming
at you today and I'm coming at you with
a really quick and easy recipe that is
great for the summer actually it's great
for all times of the year but being that
we are in the spring versus Well Spring
transferring into the summer um season
this is a great recipe not only for your
own home but also for when you're doing
get togethers and things like that and
as all my recipes they are going to save
you some money so you're going to be to
cut the cost and serve really great
items now when you're talking about
seafood salad and when you're talking
about it from buying it from your like
your deadly section in your local food
market you're looking at per pound
about7 or 8 well I'm going to show you
how you can make a huge mixing bowl full
of this for about
$8 okay so you're getting more bang for
your buff and you're also being able to
um you're also being being able to uh
know what's actually in the product or
in the salad itself and you can tweak it
to whatever you like so if you like
certain kind of vegetables and all that
then you can you can add
that all right so the things that you're
going to need of course you're going to
need some imitation crab meat now um
with the seafood salad you usually want
to use the imitation crab meat not
because you're being cheap but because
it just is the traditional way of fixing
crab salad
okay um I got this for
$628 and it's a big old package as you
can see um this is almost 3 lb okay so
this is a great value again while we're
going along check out the prices of what
I'm showing you and how much I'm showing
you as far as the pound because when
you're dealing with crab salad out of
your Deli you're paying about $8 per
pound we're going to make approximately
about 3 and 1/2 lbs of crab salad and
we're going to spend $8 meaning that
you're basically getting like a a
bargain because you're getting 3 lb
versus one lb an extra 2 lbs so this
would be great for like a cookout or get
together so you're going to need your
imitation crab
meat you're going to need salary now
depending on how much you're fixing and
how much people like that salary taste
I'm only using one stock why because
Daddy really does not eat salary and
this is specifically really for him
because this is something that he's had
a crave for so um because he doesn't
like cery okay whatever a Chu anyway
because he doesn't like it you know he
is I'm going to go use one stall all
right you're going to need also
oy now this is not just a Merin thing
this is a good cook thing if you do not
use oying your salads I'm sorry I don't
understand why you are eating that bland
salad because it is Bland salt does not
give flavor okay okay it's it does give
flavor but that's not the only thing
that you use and it does not give it a
uh great salad taste okay oey does the
trick you guys if you have not tried oey
seasoning go get it it is a blend of a
lot of different things so you don't
have to use salt with this all right
because it has salt in it but it does
have other things that is a must for a
salad that is not Bland so go check this
out you can get this out of your season
um section in your local food market oey
is a
must you're going to need black pepper
now you can use fresh ground uh black
pepper you can use any of that but you
are going to need black pepper another
ingredient you're going to need
is you're going to
need sliced black
olives and of course you're going to
need Mayo now you can use whatever brand
you like but that's up to you but these
are the things that you're going to need
for your salad all
right you're going to go ahead and slice
and dice up that uh that stalk of
celery and you want to dice
it as fine as to your liking I mean if
you like big chunks then go ahead and do
that but if you like it you want it fine
so that everybody is not you know that
doesn't like celery can't like taste big
huge chunks I would stick with the
finely diced that way again if you have
somebody that's eating it that doesn't
eat cery is not going to be like a big
huge thing to
them all
right now the black olives are already
sliced so that's the great thing so
that's why I said buy the slic ones cuz
it just saves you a little bit of time
you're going to need a mixing bowl and
you're going to also need need a mixing
spoon all
right after this recipe I'm going to be
making a fried eggplant
sandwich which is great for vegans and
vegetarians out there so be looking out
for that video as
well now we have our mixing
bowl you're going to add those
chunks that's all
you're going to add those
chunks you're going to add those chunks
to that
bowl all
right who
Nelly and we're going to break that up a
little bit you guys so I'm going to show
you how to do
that because you don't want humongous
chunks like this I mean you don't want
it to be chunks like let me show you
guys you don't want it to be chunks like
that so you're just going to break that
up you can also use your
uh your
uh your cutting board but that's up to
you I just simply just rough chop
it wow daddy these these knives these
new knives are sharp as I don't know
what
are yes I'll probably do a review on
those uh the new knife set that we
splurged and
got and also tell you some tips on how
to look for what you look for in KN
knife sets and not just getting the ones
that you see on sale or whatever but
looking for a certain quality and what
features to look for as far as getting a
quality knife set so I'll do a video on
that some other time for you guys so be
looking out for that as well so it's
pretty much after we go ahead and chop
this up you guys into chunks it's pretty
much believe it or not it's it's it's
it's all about assembly after that part
seasoning and
assembly so it's not something that's
going to take up much of your time um
what I would recommend is if you're
going to fix this for your own home or a
cookout or whatever to fix just a couple
of hours ahead of time and then to sit
it wrapped in saram WRA in the
refrigerator and that just lets the
seasonings and the Mayo all incorporate
and uh soak in marinate in shall I say
and
um it just is a really great
summary um dish to fix but again you can
fix this all year
round and you can also tweak it as far
as it being um low cal because you you
can add um a ratio of mayo lowfat Mayo
if you like or fat-free mayo and add a
little bit of Dijon um because then that
gives you you know you don't have to use
as much Mayo of course Dijon is less
Mayo than uh I mean less calories than
Mayo so that'll be a way that you can TW
tweak it you can also add some extra
vegetables if you like whatever kind you
like now um you can add a little bit of
onion to this diced up small um however
uh as you all know people that's been
viewing me for a while Daddy doesn't
like onion so we're not going to go
there with the onion but I'm just giving
you options of what you can do while I'm
cutting this up this is also great to
have with some crackers on the side um
and you can also fix it on a row believe
it or not or you can just eat it as a
side dish like on the side of you know
hamburgers or uh steak or whatever that
you put on the grill
all right so we're almost basically
almost finished with the
uh now you can also
buy um the crab salad it's called
shredded where it's already shredded
like they're basic like I'm doing right
now you can also buy the chunks um the
chunk sometimes is a little bit uh less
chunky than what I opened up my pack
packag and
had and I did a recipe with this you
guys this is
my garlic bread I made from scratch I
did a recipe on this and showed you guys
this just came out the
oven so yeah if you want to see a recipe
on how to make this Delicious from
scratch fresh garlic
bread
yeah
[Music]
delish stay tuned for that
video all
right so we're almost done with this you
guys thank you for bearing with
me tastes fresh doesn't it
mhm has a slight little different taste
to it but it's a it's a good
taste that's cuz it's
fresh imagine that with like your uh
lasagna or your stuff shell your
vegetarian stuff shell I
mean I let my daughter uh always sit
where I'm
cooking and watch me because it's
important for them to know how to fix
these things and feed their own families
in the future that they'll have on a
budget you know no matter what income
level you are it's always wise and in
fact this is biblical to be good
stewards over your finances and your
money it frees up money for other things
as well maybe you want to grow a
business or start a business maybe you
want to pay for your own schooling you
don't want to rely on just grants or uh
financial aid it just gives you um
more opportunities in life when you are
wise with your finances so I want her to
be able to that way if she decides to go
out of state going to college she'll be
able to feed herself and she doesn't
have to rely on McDonald's to do so she
doesn't have to relow Burger King a Taco
Bell when they running unhealthy
special she'll be able to feed
herself and she'll be a to do so not
with taking every inch of her check to
do
so so as you're cooking
ladies show your children how to do so
and to do quick and easy meals you know
it doesn't have to always be something
difficult this is not too difficult the
most is the cutting up this which like I
said you can avoid what I'm doing and
buy it already
flaked but look at how many times a
person can eat on on
this and it only cost about eight bucks
so we've
already done this as you can see and
compare this again to how much you get
at the
deli which is usually Bland as I don't
know what to be honest quite frankly at
the deli in your food market you would
get a pound this is about 3 lb for that
$8 all right so now we've done
The Chopping all right so that's what
it's going to look like once it's all
chopped up into
chunks what we're going to do now is
we're going to add
in I'm going to separate some of this
because daddy is so funny acting you
guys he really does not like salery so
I'm going to go ahead and be
nice separate a portion for
him and then I'll have the rest for the
house and if any guests come over and
all
that all right so I'm going to do his
separately and I'll do that off camera
because it's going to be pretty bland as
far as not the seasoning but he doesn't
like the salary he doesn't like the
black oliv he just wants some seafood
salad with some mayo and some seasoning
so I'm going to do his off camera it's
not that exciting but I'm going to go
ahead and do the bulk of it on camera
and that's going to have the other
ingredients in it
all right so we're going to go ahead and
add in our stalk of cery that we've
already diced
up we're going to also add in that whole
can of black olives
drained and if you're wanting to know
the measurements of mayo we're going to
add
in about two cups of mayo for a 3 lb
salad
okay that's about one
cup that's about two cups so we're going
to see how if we have to add more but
you probably won't have to but we'll
see all
right and then we're going to add in oy
now if you're wanting to know about the
amount o b we're going to use I would
say that's probably about
um it's probably about I would say about
two
tpoon and black pepper you're going to
add probably
about I say one
teaspoon and you're going to mix that
all together you guys now again we can
add more of that
Mayo if you need
it and of course you can add in a little
bit of dejon mayo I mean um
mustard or you can use spicy mustard to
give it a little kick that's up to
you but you want to incorporate
everything together we're going to add a
little bit more Mayo in a second we just
I just want to make sure I cover it
most of it so that I can see accurately
how much Mayo we have to use because you
have to understand that once you put
this in the refrigerator let it sit it's
going to soak in all right so because
it's going to soak in it's going to draw
in some of that Mayo we're going to add
probably about
another half a cup 1/4 cup that's
probably about 1/4 cup um it's going to
draw in that Mayo
so I would rather it be a little moist
or a little bit moist than moist than I
would want it to be because once it
draws in and after
setting then it be the consistency that
I really wanted it in the first place if
you're following what I'm saying and
that's enough right there actually
that's enough
Mayo but that's it you guys now you can
add a little bit more um oey on the
top make it look pretty and also to give
it make sure that people get that oey
taste but that that is it believe it or
not this is very
easy very easy and you've made about 3
lbs of seafood salad literally within
minutes and you only paid about eight
bucks and you have a big mix in bowl
full also another way to stretch this
dish you guys is add some Penny Noodles
yes boil some Penny Noodles make sure
you add a little bit of salt to the
water boil them put them underneath with
the cold water one once they've all
cooled down make sure they cooled down
because you don't want to mix the hot
noodles with this mayil once it's cooled
down add a little bit more oy because
you had to season the uh Penny Noodles
as well but mix that add a little bit
more Mayo mix all of that together and
you have a wonderful pasta seafood salad
and it once you add the pasta this bowl
will be totally full this big huge
mixing bowl will be totally full that's
another way to stretch the dish that's
another way to bring something that's
economical to a potop easy on your
pockets beautiful on the eyes and
wonderful on the taste buds so on that
note you guys I hope that you've enjoyed
this video I thank you for viewing I
thank you for allowing me to share and I
thank you for finding value in that of
which I do until next time talk to you
