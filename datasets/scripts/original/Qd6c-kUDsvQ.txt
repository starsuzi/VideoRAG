hi I'm Stephanie jorski of Joy
baking.com today we're going to make a
crispy oatmeal cookie so the first thing
you need to do is preheat your up to
375° fenhe which is 190° C and then you
will need uh two baking sheets and uh
you can either line them with a piece of
parchment paper like I've done here or
you could just lightly butter or even
spray them with one of those non-stick
sprays so um if you're using a Stam
mixer like I am here use a paddle
attachment but you could just as easily
use a uh hand mixer for this so the
first thing we need is one cup that's
226 G of butter I like to use the
unsalted butter cuz I like the flavor
better but you could use salted if
that's what you want and have it at room
temperature and then what we're going to
do first is just beat the uh butter just
until it gets nice and creamy and smooth
like maybe a minute or
so
okay so just um scrape down the sides of
your
bowl and then we're going to add both
white and brown sugar to this oatmeal
cookie so I'm going to add 1 cup 200 g
of granulated white sugar and 2/3 of a
cup which is 140 G of light brown sugar
if you're not weighing it if you're
measuring make sure you really uh pack
it into your measuring
cup and then I'm just going to beat this
just until it's all Incorporated you
know maybe a couple minutes
okay so again scrape down the sides if
you need to and make sure you do the
bottom and then next we're going to add
two large eggs and have those at room
temperature along with h one teaspoon of
pure vanilla
extract and then an oatmeal cookie is
quite soft and chewy in texture so what
I'm going to do is is just add just to
help with with that um really nice soft
and chewy texture I'm going to add just
a half a tablespoon of light corn syrup
now if you don't have corn syrup you
could use golden syrup you could use um
honey or glucose or you could just leave
it out it's really not that much but I
just find just a little bit
helps the
texture and then just beat that
in okay you can see this is a really
fast and easy batter to make like all
cookies or most cookies I should
say so now that's our
uh wet ingredients so now for our dry
ingredients in a separate Bowl I have
two cups that's 260 g of allpurpose
flour you may know that is plain flour
and to that I'm adding one teaspoon of
baking soda now that the baking soda um
is a leaver of course but it also when
you use it in this cookie it helps to uh
make the edges of the cookie nice and
crisp and then uh a/4 teaspoon of salt
I'm using the kosher salt now if you use
salted butter I would just leave out
that salt and then what I'm also adding
a little different is just one teaspoon
of ground coffee coffee not the instant
this is like just the ground coffee
coffee you use in your coffee maker in
the morning I find it just adds a little
depth of flavor to the cookie now again
you could leave that out if you don't
like
coffee and then just
whisk your ingredients together cuz you
want to make sure that baking soda is
really mixed into your
flour and then I'm just going to
add my dry ingredients to the batter
and just start at um low speed you don't
want that flour coming up in your face
just until it's mixed
[Music]
in Okay so um I'll just show you it's
not quite mixed in all of the flour but
what I'm going to do right now I'm going
to scrape down my
sides but I'm going to start these
oatmeal cookies have lots of extras um
in it the batter so I'm going to start
adding that
now so I'm going to add 1 and 1/2 cups
that's 360 mL of rolled o I'm using the
oldfashioned roll dos um because they're
a little thicker and than the instant
ones which then gives us some more chewy
texture to our cookie um if you don't
have oldfashioned you could use uh
instant and then I'm also going to be
adding 1 and 1/2 cups that's 360 M of
chocolate chips now you could um use
semi bittersweet
white milk chocolate or you could even
kind of use a combination of those so
I'm just going to add some of my
chocolate chips now if you um if you
have a Stam mixer like I have you can do
this in your mixer but if you have a
hand mixer you might want to start
folding these ingredients just by hand
[Music]
okay going add the rest chocolate
chips
okay a lot of batter here so I'm just
going
to sure you get down to the bottom
want to make sure that the uh the rolled
oats and the chocolate chips are mixed
into all the batter that's why you know
you might want to do
this by hand if you don't have a
heavyduty
mixer okay so now the last kind of a
surprise
ingredient is I'm going to put in some
rice cereal that's why I call these
crispy oatmeal cookies because we're
adding 1 and 1/2 cups that's 36 60 mL of
rice cereal and that's what I mean these
you have the crispy edges of the cookie
you have the soft and chewy texture and
then this just kind of adds this little
bit of um crispy
crunch now gently mix this in again you
could do it by
hand okay so that's are
batter now this um makes a lot of
cookies if you're making uh I'm going to
make large cookies here you will
probably get about
30 um if you make small ones you could
get 60 so if you think that's a little
too much then just half the
recipe Okay so
to form our
cookies like I said I'm going to make
large cookies so I'm using um an ice
cream scoop that's maybe a little less
than a/4 of a cup 60 milliliters you
could just use a/4 cup measuring or if
you want to make smaller you could just
do like a tablespoon or so onto your um
cookie sheet just try to make all your
cookies the uh same size so they'll bake
in the same time time now if your batter
was really soft you might want to
refrigerate the batter for like an hour
to firm it up and what is really great
about this um batter you could just
store it in the fridge for a couple days
and then kind of bake your cookies off
when you want
some what I would do if I was going to
do that I would form my cookies like
this just put them all in a cookie sheet
cover it with a piece of plastic wrap
and pop it in the fridge and then you
can just take them out and bake them
when you
want because while the the uh outside
edges are nice and crispy that if you
store the cookies overnight in an
airtight container they will soften so
that's a good thing about um baking them
and eating them the same
day so I would space them they do
because I'm making these large ones you
know
don't put too many on your cookie
sheet I'm just going to put
six and
then just with my fingers I'm just going
to flatten those
Mounds like so okay so now um depending
on the size for this size I would say
anywhere from 10 to 13 minutes they will
spread and what what you're looking for
because everybody's oven is a little
different what you're looking for is the
outside edges of the cookies to be nice
and golden brown but the centers of the
cookies will still be quite
soft okay our crispy oatmeal cookies are
done you can see the outsides are
beautifully golden brown well the S the
inside if you can see I'm touching it
it's quite soft so you really can vary
um the texture of the oatmeal cookie
depending on how long you bake it if you
want a little more soft and chewy bake
it a little less if you want it more
crispy you can bake it a little more now
these are really quite soft so I would
let them cool on the uh baking sheet on
a wire rack for about 5 minutes and then
transfer them um off of the uh baking
pan onto a wire wack to finish cooling
so um you can cover and store these for
a few days so until next time I'm
