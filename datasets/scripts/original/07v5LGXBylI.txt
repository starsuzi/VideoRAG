Welcome to the Nespresso Assistance video on cleaning your Lattissima Touch Machine.
In order to obtain a perfect cup of coffee, time after time, we suggest you follow some simple instructions.
After every use, it is important to remove the used capsule and not let it remain in the extraction system.
We recommend that you regularly empty the capsule container and drip tray in order to avoid overflowing.
The quality of water is essential for enhancing the quality aroma of your espresso,
so we suggest you refill the water tank on a daily basis, using fresh water. 
Next, place a cup under the coffee outlet and press the «Lungo» in order to wash away any residue left in the flow system.
Do not put any machine components in the dishwasher, except the Rapid Cappuccino components.
Use a clean, damp cloth and mild cleaning agent to clean the surface of the machine, 
being careful not to use any strong agent or solvent cleaner
