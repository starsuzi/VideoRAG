hi I'm Margie from margery's candies and
I'm going to make today for you soapas
which is a Mexican dessert that is
served with honey and what we'll need to
start is flour one cup of flour one
teaspoon of baking powder a tablespoon
of Crisco a half a teaspoon of salt
you'll combine that and then you're
going to add just enough hot water to
bring all
together okay so I'm going to start with
the flour just going to of combine all
the dry
ingredients okay I'm going to mix that
together I'm going to cut
in I'm going to cut in this little bit
of
shortening I say Crisco that's
shortening kind of just like you would
be if you were making a pie crust
prob be just
fine let me get a little bit of hot
water just going to add a little
bit okay just enough to make a make it
come together just like a pie crust okay
can't be more than a couple of
tablespoons it's just half water
now because you're using the baking
powder that's double acting again I'm
going to make these and I'm I'm going to
um I'm right now I am heating up oil
[Music]
slowly very slowly because like I said
I'm going to roll these out and let them
sit while the oil is heating up to about
400° it's going to be very
hot I'm just going to try to get that
oil to go in there
now this is a half2 cup uh
dish and it was almost
full like I said you add it
slowly
okay
Co that put a little flour down on my
board and we'll just bring this together
kneaded
together I'm going to roll it out to
about an eighth of an inch thick
these are going when we fry these
they're going to puff up into big
balls big Pockets I call it like B
you serve them with lots of honey it's a
dessert sometimes when you go to a
restaurant um and they have soapa Peas
on the menu if they're not really the
authentic they um to um soapa Pia they
might just be frying up a flour
tortilla that really isn't a
soopa
so it gets a little bit too um thin just
push it together okay I'm going to cut
it
a pizza
cutter and maybe I'll cut it
into I'll just make three or I'm sorry
six maybe we'll cut them a little
smaller okay and I'm going to set them
on a board on this little r just to
sit because I I said the baking powder
will rise with the moisture there's not
too much moisture in here but there's
enough to let let it sit for a few
minutes while this is heating up okay
I'm going to turn that to high and in
about 10 minutes or five 5 to 10 minutes
it should be ready almost up to 400 and
we'll I'll show you what happens when
you fry them okay well now the fat has
reached 400° and I've just actually
turned down a little bit and I'm going
to drop in a soap ofia and you can be
able to see what happens
puffs up into a little pillow
I'm going to drop another one in because
the temperature did not drop so it's
okay
you want to give them lots of room so
three is enough I don't have that many
that I'm
cooking they shouldn't be too dark
you serve these with lots of honey I
also like these with a cinnamon sugar it
just depends on what you like but I'm
going to serve these with honey because
that is the traditional way to serve a
soap
ofia you want to keep the fat very hot
it's up to 400
I'm going to take this little guy out
here's a little
pillow okay I took them out of the all
the out of the fat and they've cooled
down just a little bit and what you do
is you you serve them they make it
there's a hole in there they puff up and
you put a little put a little or a lot
however much honey you like that's how
you serve them and you eat
them that's a soap ofia little pockets
little pocket bread
