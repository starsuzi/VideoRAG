hi everyone acen here I know it's been a
while since I made a cooking video but
today I'm going to show you how to make
a Filipino food called P for this recipe
you will need the following
ingredients 2 cups of coconut
milk 2 cups of rice flour you can get
rice flour at any type of Asian store
typically a Filipino store one 1 cup of
granulated sugar half a teaspoon of salt
3 TPO of baking powder and since it's
optional but you can also use cheese
that you put on top of the
bo the other materials needed for this
Bole recipe is a sifter also known as a
strainer you need silicone mini cupcake
liners it's best to use silicone so they
can slip out
easily a mixing bowl to mix everything
in and a
steamer to steam my PO though today I'm
using a Denny food steamer you can cook
you can steam any type of food well most
foods fish vegetables more
vegetables it's really handy to have
around the
house the first step to our procedures
is taking the sifter and put bring it
into the bowl well on top of the bowl
and you're going to take your rice
flour pour it all
in take your
sugar pour it all
in your
salt C it there we
go and you're baking
powder and now if any of you are into
baking you know how to sit you're just
going to lift it up and just tap the
side until all of your dry ingredients
are
done now our next procedure is we're
going to take our coconut milk
and pour it into all of our dry
ingredients now we're going to take our
whisk hand mixer and have a mixer little
thingy want to use I'm just going to
going to stir it until it becomes
smooth now that it's completely Blended
in we're going to spread out our liners
and I use a little cup up to scoop it up
and put it in here
so scoop it and scrap it on the side a
little
bit and
then pour it in and fill it at least 2/3
full not all the
way that's about
it now that I have completed placing the
batter inside the liners I am going to
add my cheese now you can also use
blocks of cheese but you'll have to cut
those into little rectangles so they can
fit on top I'm using strips of cheese
and I already have some set up right
here only put about three or four strips
of cheese on each
one
before you start with your steaming if
you use the steamer you put the water in
the very bottom and this is the steam
catcher so when the water goes to this
just
steam it drips in here so don't forget
that now I've placed my brle inside the
Steamers making sure it's not on the
edge and that they're not completely
touching
my second
level then the
cover demo purposes I'm only using two
of the three levels and down here it
says 43 that's just a default so you
press the minus
button let it
Ste be careful not to touch it cuz it's
[Music]
