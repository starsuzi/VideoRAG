help my washing machine is not reliably
emptying the water from the spin cycle
I got on wikiHow and I've checked the
drain hose it's not clogged up it's
draining but the water is just not going
up where it's supposed to go into the
wall and then I show you some footage of
that
kintel so here if you have any ideas I
surely would like to know them so
Kenmore washer 80 series I opened it
earlier today and it was not draining
water this is not the load I did get it
to drain out of my towels and they've
been successfully laundry today but I
went on wikiHow and I pulled everything
out took the cord off put it in the
bathtub ran hot water through it it
wasn't clogged up at all and got the
towels who successfully drain I checked
it and water was just pouring through
here it worked
work just fine so I decided to test it
with a smaller load of clothes to make
sure it was working before I felt like a
big huge load of heavy towels and again
and these felt to drink so I can show
you like when I put it on spin
the noise it makes
there's no water cutting out
let me close it show you that no water's
coming out
however if I take this get lower yeah
water's coming out now
nasty dirty water something it's a comp
right because it just doesn't want to
push that water up that pipe but it will
push it out when it's lower even though
the washing machine is not spinning then
you really get that water out
so I got stopping it this handled now I
have that to deal with Oh God
so now I'm doing this I have something
under there in case it's hot bucks off
again
and that this people like didn't notice
it unless it is going to come
wastebasket lowest level but I need to
rent please plays because they still had
a lot of studs on them I was able to
rinse the clothes and get them drained
like this but obviously I don't want to
have to go through this every time I do
a load of clothes at least not for very
long
and I'm thinking it might be the pump
because the water will drain as long as
the pump and as low it just doesn't do
it at the end when there is not a lot of
pressure pushing it out so I'm thinking
as a pop what do you guys think
