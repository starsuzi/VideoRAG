okay so Rea has this little skin growth
on his leg and it hasn't been anything
serious but he caught it on something
and now he is all bloody so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to wash it up
really good and then I'm going to use
cayenne powder to stop the bleeding he's
got blood everywhere on his tail and
both back legs all over the house and I
have actually used the cayenne powder
on quite a few cuts and one of them I
was butchering a chicken and I cut
myself really deep and it took quite a
few applications of the cayenne powder
for that one but it didn't sting it
didn't sting at all so I feel safe using
it on my dog okay there there is a lot
of blood this thing is
bleeding really bad I just got it all
cleaned up and it's
just just
crazy so what I'm going to do
let's put some cayenne powder you want
to make sure that it doesn't have any
wheat in it you want to make sure it's
pure cayenne
powder and you can see he's not freaking
out there's no pain he's shaking because
I'm doing something to him and oh
my everybody knows what
a what a manly dog he
is so I'm just going to keep applying
pressure and may have to do this a few
times this seems like a a pretty good
one okay so I could do a video showing
me using Cayenne to um stop bleeding on
a wound and I could fake it if it didn't
hurt but if I'm actually doing it to a
dog and an open wound and he's not
reacting at
all this proves that Cayenne does not
stand when you put it on a on a
wound so this may take a few
applications this one is bleeding really
good um but I'm going to clean it up
again after I'm done and then dress it
and keep an eye on them for a long time
tonight okay it's kind of hard to see
cuz my my lighting isn't very good but
obviously he was up here bleeding for
quite a while before I even realized
it
um yeah there's there's a lot of blood
looks like I massed somebody in
here oh and there's more spots up here
but like I said the lighting is bad
so poor kid okay so what I'm going to do
is just uh I'm not going to put any more
pressure on this because the pressure
might just open that wound back
up no I'm not a doctor I just play one
on YouTube I really have no idea what
I'm talking about I almost had him rush
him up to the clinic and call one of the
doctors come in cuz was really
bad so I'm just going to oh first I'm
going to put some
more cayenne
powder just going to sprinkle it on
there because this stuff is the shiz
knit I'm just going to wrap this back up
and wrap the tape snugly around
here and then I'm just going to keep
checking his toes to make sure that I
didn't get it too tight
and and go from there and he's just such
a good
boy he's just lays around
and what a good
puppy I think you need to have a green
bean mom needs to get a green bean for
you cuz that's her favorite in the whole
wide
world
and there we
go there we
go good pop AR
