This is the Karcher K2 Compact Pressure Washer.
It has the power of a standard sized Karcher
unit but packed into a much smaller lightweight
package.
It's ideally suited for cleaning things such
as patios, cars, caravans and boats and it
comes supplied with two lances, a foam lance,
a car cleaning brush, the T50 Patio Cleaning
attachment, two packs of detergents as well
as the hose and hand gun.
Now, before I get cleaning with it, let's
have a look at how it's all connected together.
The water supply plugs in at the back, while
the hose screws in at the front here as I've
done and the other end of the hose plugs into
the hand gun.
Now that's plugged in I just need to connect
it to the mains power.
Let's take a look at some of the attachments.
The T50 Patio Cleaning attachment is great
for use on concrete, stone and decking.
While the dirt blaster attachment is designed
for more targeted cleaning.
The car cleaning brush is a brilliant all-purpose,
vehicle cleaning tool and it works equally
well with both water and Karcher shampoo.
This is the foam lance attachment for all
Karcher pressure washers.
It's designed to produce a rich foamy lather
to get your car's finish looking sparkling
and streak-free.
It's really simple to use, just fill the tank
with some Karcher shampoo, attach it to the
hand gun on your pressure washer and you're
ready to get spraying.
The K2 Compact is available on the eSpares
website, along with a range of other spares
for Karcher and other manufacturers.
Thanks for watching!
