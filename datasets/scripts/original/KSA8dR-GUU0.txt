hello and welcome i'm shannon the daily
diyer
for today's project i have a unique way
to display your child's chore chart
so stay tuned
so for this diy project i'm actually
going to be using a
1x4 piece of common board that i just
picked up
at my home depot store i cut this one
down to 40 inches long
you can adjust your sizes to your skin
i'm also going to be using these
chalkboard clothes pins
these i picked up at michael's they come
in a pack of two
like this um i believe these were in the
like dollar
bin section these were like a dollar
fifty i'm also going to be using
some miniature black clothes pins that i
also picked up at michael's
in their scrapbooking section so the
things that i went ahead
and pre-did and prepped for this project
was i cut my wood down to that 40 inch
length you cut yours down to the size
that you need
and i went ahead and i stained the wood
i added a picture
a sawtooth picture and i also cut out
alyssa's chores um with my silhouette
machine
and went ahead and put that on there
um the other vinyl that i added was to
the chalkboard clothespin clip
and this one says done the other thing
that i did
and i used my silhouette machine for was
i cut out
these tags i just used plain white
cardstock so it was a little bit thicker
and chunky
so i cut out several of these tags and i
went ahead and i
put the black clothes pins
i'm going to be using six of the black
clothes pins for this 40 inch length
and i went ahead and i clipped one tag
onto each of the black clothes pins
and i'll show you why this is going to
give me
my spacing for how i glue on
the clips to the board so i'm using six
of these
you can adjust yours to the length that
you'll be using
and i'm just going to line these up down
the length of the board
and then at the very bottom i'm going to
be putting my done
chalkboard and for these i'm actually
going to clip on
one lengthwise like this
and put this towards the very bottom so
once you have these on here you can
adjust
so you have even spacing
and you can kind of spread them out a
little once you have your clothes pins
evenly spaced out and looking nice
and even i'm just going to be using my
hot glue gun and hot glue gun sticks
and i'm going to put a bead of glue on
the back of each one of these clothes
pins
to adhere them to the board
super quick and easy
make sure you center your clothes pin
and it just takes a few seconds for it
to adhere and dry
so you're just going to work your way
down the board until you're all the way
finished
here is our finished chore chart which
is a little bit long for me to show
the whole thing at once so make sure you
stay tuned to the end and i'll make sure
to insert some videos of the whole thing
and also some close-ups of the details
but i think that this was such a nice
different kind of way to
create a chore chart that would also
kind of blend in with your home's decor
and it's easy for you to write down the
chores that need to be done either
during the day
or during that week and then your little
one can
unclip them by themselves and just put
it down here at the done
clip and um that shows what they i hope
that this project
