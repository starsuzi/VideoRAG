welcome to e Plastics today we're going
to show you how to Flame polish
acrylic while a sanded or saw cut Edge
can be polished we at e Plastics always
prepare our edges with a fine miled Edge
before
polishing always debur frayed paper
before
polishing one of the ways to polish
acrylic with the paper on is to place it
on an aluminum sheet and block the top
with an aluminum
bar at e Plastics we use a hydrogen
oxygen mix for flame polishing
acrylic in the absence of this ideal
setup a map gas torch can
work
beveled or rounded over edges can be
polished the same
way in the absence of aluminum you can
pull the paper back to Flame
polish
flame polishing introduces a higher
level of stress to this
material gluing or wiping these edges
with chemicals can lead to
crazing you can see here how a flame
polished Edge crazes once you apply
glue thanks for
watching
