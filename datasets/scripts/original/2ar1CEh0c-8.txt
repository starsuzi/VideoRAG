today we are replacing
the front brake pads and rotors on a
nissan
frontier se 2005 version
i guess and first of all you have to
take the tire off
which if you don't know how to do that
there's probably a youtube video on it
and here we go
we're getting in the way
first of all there are two
bolts behind you i don't know if you can
see this
he's taking them off right now there's
one up here
right here and then there's one at the
very bottom
down here down here i don't know if you
can see there we go
okay you don't need to get in that close
shut up this is going on youtube so
they gotta know exactly how to do it
otherwise there's
no point in making this video and then
you take the brake
calipers off and you can just really
put them anywhere make sure you don't
stress the brake cable
cable it holds the brake fluid because
you don't want any holes in that or
anything
then you take the brake pads off
there's a lot of wear on this one
especially on the back there's a big
groove
that's why i'm replacing it
okay
now here comes the hard part again
next part for this is you have to take
these two bolts off in the back i don't
know if you guys can see this there's
one right here
at the top there's one at the bottom
these were a pain to take off last time
we already did the other side
took like half an hour just to get those
things off
so you can get off first time
if you have trouble getting it off you
can use your foot
because your legs are the strongest part
of your body
that was a lot easier that time yeah
last time we had to use the air gun
[Music]
geez this is like the fastest one so far
right now that we have those off
well loosened at least
what do you have air gun for a little
bit easier
we're going to use air gun just to take
it off fast because we're lazy
there you go the whole caliper
assembly's off
now you have to do is hit the brake pad
brake rotor
until it falls
yo me do it i'll kick it
you can use any type of hammer usually
it's stuck on there pretty good
there we go
hopefully they can hear our voice pretty
well
otherwise it's not really that great
yeah pretty much i mean if they don't
know what we're doing
these are the new rotors hey put them
next to each other so we can see what
they look like
when you get that one out of there
this is the old brake rotor
it's all rusted and everything on the
side it's a big old there's a lot of
grooves
you really wore these things down and
these are the new ones
nice and shiny
now we're just positioning it
our mechanics obviously having a bit of
trouble with this
there he goes
and now basically you just do the same
thing in reverse
for when you are taking it off put the
two
bolts back on first
tighten down
need me hold that for you the rotors
now we're going to use the air gun again
because it's way faster
huh
now put the brake
caliper back on
and uh which bolt do you put on first
bottom one you're gonna keep the bottom
one on this time yes
all right you put the bottom one on
first
so it stays in place but you can still
put your brake pads on you just
fall down like that you need the uh yeah
what's it called wood clamp yeah and
you can use there's plenty of methods
for
getting these pistons depressed but
we're using a wood clamp
which we find the easiest method
with least stress
you just put on the edge of the piston
and simply screw it in
and they should stay depressed after
you've tightened it so you don't need to
keep it on there
do you mind if your face you know gets
in the shot i don't care right
now for the brake pads this is like
unbelievably fast i can't believe we
even wanted this pass
and we got nice ceramic brake pads
for extra stopping power i guess
you got it
and you take the lube that you get in
the
packaging you just
you have to buy it separately yeah that
didn't come with it no
okay well you have to buy it separately
and you just put it on the
edges what would that be called like
ears the lips or whatever ears
the gears ears the ears you put on the
ears of the brake pad
those two little things right there that
you obviously can see
with purple
and the back one you just kind of
slip it into place there should be two
clamps right
yeah there's two clamps you have to push
into
can't really get a good shot of it
because
he's lubing it up ready for insertion
anyways you just
kind of get into the clamps there
i don't know if you guys can see it it's
right there
it's not that hard
and then lubes up the uh
edges of the caliper and the pistons
so it doesn't squeal so it doesn't make
a lot of noise
any squeakage while you're breaking
all right it's pretty easy
and just puts it back up there and
tightens down the top bolts
you need a wrench what size was it you
got it
also you don't want to have anything
under the brake rotor in case you're a
jack
which we wouldn't really shouldn't be
using to jack we should be using a jack
stand but we don't have one
but you don't want to keep your hands or
legs under the rotors
in case it falls so it doesn't like
crush you
because cars are heavy
anyways i'm just tightening up the bolts
on the caliper
to get it back in place you want it
pretty tight really tight actually so it
doesn't
come undone while you're driving down
the road
i've been bad
now for the tire
you got that special yeah dog get them
for
all you
now i put the tire on
got it
let's pick it up
you got it all lined up
you just want to position it onto the
bolts and you put the lug nuts on
sometimes it can be a bit of a pain if
your cameraman's not helping you do this
or if you're by yourself but he got it
fortunately there's a special one
and when you're tightening lug nuts
when you're hand tightening you don't
really have to go across but
just leave that down there
just go across to show them what you
should do see you want to go across
so the tight tire tightens evenly on the
and that's how to that's how i change a
brake pad
and rotor on a nissan 2005 nissan
frontier sc
thanks
