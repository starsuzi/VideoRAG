so today we're going to be doing a
really simple
natural disinfectant spray
super
simple smells great
what you'll need is vinegar so
you can use just the regular vinegar or
you can get a cleaning vinegar and i
think it's six percent
um acidic acid or something
so i just use the regular vinegar from
costco it's you know
two big containers for under ten dollars
so what i've done
is i have peeled a lemon
so i've took the rind of a lemon and
i've infused it
in a vinegar solution so i just poured
vinegar over top
and
so once you've done that
you want to just let it sit for a while
in a cabinet
left it in my cabinet for around a month
and this way
the lemon
gets super infused into the vinegar and
you don't even really smell the vinegar
smell anymore so
a really super clean
lemon smell
you can keep it longer you don't have to
do it as long but the longer it sits the
more
lemon smell you get
and then once you have
done that step
you just want to dilute it
a one-to-one ratio so
you'll fill it up
let's say your spray bottles
those big
you'll want to fill it up
half with the vinegar solution
and then the rest you want to fill up
with water
and there you go you have yourself a
really natural clean disinfectant spray
i use this including my kitchen the
bathroom
after my little guy
yeah
and i really like it you can
skip the whole
lemon phase just use vinegar but
i don't personally like the smell of
vinegar all that much it does go away
after you
[Music]
after it dries so it's not really a big
issue but
super simple
