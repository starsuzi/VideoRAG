Hi.
I'm Jennifer from Workroom Social, and today
we are going to talk about fabric puckering.
So, sometimes you're sewing and you think
everything is going really well, and then
you pull your fabric out from behind your
machine and you look at it, and the fabric
is all puckered.
So, let's talk about a couple things that
you can do to troubleshoot that problem.
First thing is you want to look at your tension
on your thread.
If your tension is too high, it might be causing
the fabric to bunch up because everything
is really tight.
So, you might want to try loosening your thread
tension so everything is kind of just a little
bit more relaxed.
Another thing you should try to check if your
fabric is puckering is your needle.
If you're sewing with a dull needle, especially
if you are sewing woven fabrics, if the needle
is having a hard time puncturing the fabric,
that might cause your fabric to pucker.
And then the last thing I would say, if you
are having a problem with puckering, is to
look at the way you are actually maneuvering
and handling the fabric in your machine.
So, as you are sewing, you want to try your
best to let the feed dogs, which are the little
teeth that sit on the bottom of your sewing
machine, you want to let the feed dogs pull
the fabric on its own, at its own pace.
A lot of times, new sewers try to either push
the fabric through.
Or, sometimes you get this motion where you're
pulling it from behind.
You really want to let the feed dogs do all
the work and you don't really want to help
the fabric.
You just want to guide the fabric so it's
going straight and you're sewing in a straight
line.
So, see how you're sewing and maneuvering
the fabric, and hopefully those things will
help you fix any of your puckering problems.
