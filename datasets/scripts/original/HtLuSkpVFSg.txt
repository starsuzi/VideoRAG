hi I'm Christina Jackson natural food
chef and holistic health coach today I'm
here to show you how to make some
delicious dairyfree chocolate milk now
the base of this milk since we're not
using Dairy is going to be cashews and
cashews are absolutely sweet and tasty
and creamy as well so it's a great
alternative um we have about a half a
cup of raw cashews we have about a/4 to
1/ half a cup of pitted dates 1/4 cup of
raw cacao powder this is going to be the
base of our milk now put a a good
quantity of water here but you want to
make sure it's high quality water that's
going to really increase the quality of
your milk so it could be distilled or
natural spring water but you want to
make sure it's high quality okay so
let's go ahead and combine all the
ingredients into our high-speed blender
so add your
cashews go ahead and add your pitted
dates add your cacao
powder we'll start that off with a
little bit of water just to get it
started place the top
on Let It
Roll okay it looks like it needs a
little more water so what I'm going to
do is probably pour about half of this
in which is about 2 cups
having fun in there getting all
creamy you know I'm going to add a
little bit more
water about I'd say another half2 cup
and that should do it
let me grab my
cup that is some chocolate milk so not
only is it creamy but it's frothy as
well and that's how you make chocolate
cashew milk
enjoy well thanks for watching be sure
