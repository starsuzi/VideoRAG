anybody knows me that knows how much I
like being outdoors and I like cooking
outside and being outside and and uh you
know just just enjoying the Sun and and
you know
whatever but the worst thing that can
happen to you when you're having a
barbecue or an outdoor party is
mosquitoes now every knows about
citrella candles and Cella torches and I
love the Torches actually but the
candles I think are a waste of time I
mean what happens to them you burn them
one day and they burn pretty good
um the next day you burn them and what's
it do it burns down the middle and you
got all this wax left on the
outside so I decided to make my own
kind now the ones you buy in the store
probably have anywhere from one to one
and 12 O of citrinella oil per per pound
of
wax well I'm using two maybe a little
more than two now what I've done is I've
taken a pound of wax and i' I've melted
it just in an old coffee pot set in a
pan of boiling water I've melted it and
I pour it in my bucket
here now what we did with these wigs is
we've taken actually the Centrella torch
Wick
Wicks and we we soaked them in wax and
cill oil okay and we did this one
yesterday
um we split them in
half and I stick it down in the wax and
I just got some bread and butter knives
to hold it in
place now you may have to have four
because they like to slide I mean us
think you want pels pin
anything anything that just holds it in
place I let that thing set for for 24
hours some people say 24 some people say
48 we've let this one sit for 24 hours
well we met this thing about 3:00
yesterday 3 or 4:00 yesterday and it's
about 7
now and look how good it's doing it's
like having a mini
fireplace on your patio table
so we'll see how this thing does I mean
I I don't know how it's going to turn
out but it's looking pretty good right
now I mean the M the wax is melting on
the outside I don't think we're going to
waste anything I think we burn every bit
of wax in that candle
