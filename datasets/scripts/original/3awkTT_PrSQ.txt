hi welcome Carol Fitzgerald here from
vegan recipes for health.com today we
are going to talk about dandelion
greens this used to be known as a weed
in our Lawns my dad would go out and
pick these up dig them up from the lawn
because they made his Lawn Lawn look
terrible but also my mother and father
used to go to the countryside and pick
these dandelion greens and bring them
home and cook them as a child I never
you know developed a taste for dandelion
greens but they have many many health
benefits and today we're going to talk
about them in a smoothie so this many
dandelion greens can you imagine eating
that many it is a little bit of a bitter
green so uh I don't know if you could
eat it plain we're going to put this
right into our blender here our Vitamix
blender along with with a cup of
ice a frozen
banana this is a two cup
measure and as you can see it's not
quite filled with strawberries so maybe
a cup and a half of
strawberries with the stems intact there
are nutrients there
too and into the blender it
goes we're going to secure our
lid
and turn it
on and it's done about 45
seconds going to pour it into our
glass I know
why they call these smoothies
because they're really smooth going
down you can taste the
strawberries you might want to put two
bananas in to sweeten it up a little bit
this is good for me but if you'd like it
just a little bit
sweeter do two frozen bananas you know
how bananas have this very short window
of time before they get over ripe you
only have about 2 days when they're just
right to eat they're either too green or
they're too ripe so just before they get
too ripe and you don't want to eat them
that way uh peel them and put them in
your freezer I put them in one or two
bananas at a time sometimes I will mash
them before I put them in the freezer
and let them thaw and then use them in
banana bread uh but you can use them
whole and it makes the drink the
smoothie that you make cold also along
with the ice dandelion green smoothie it
dandelion greens are cleansing they're
hydrating they're full of calcium and
pottassium
really a very very healthy food for you
to eat and get it in the green in the
drink the green smoothie and you don't
even realize you're eating the greens
they're very very very high in vitamins
a c and k so if you want lots of health
benefits try dandelion greens in your
smoothie if you're watching this on
