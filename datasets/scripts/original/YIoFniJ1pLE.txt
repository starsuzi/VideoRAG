hi this is Troy from Ace Appliance in
too Ohio welcome back to another inhome
diagnostic video brought to you by
appliancevideo.com
okay what we're looking at today we're
looking at a Whirlpool Cabrio uh
customer situation when he puts it on
drain and spin and push starts it it
doesn't drain this particular one I can
hear the pump making a noise like it's
trying to drain so what we're going to
do is we're going to turn it off
disconnect power you're going to need
for this job a putty knife a tack puller
SL flat blade screwdriver pair of pliers
a
7/16 socket and a quinch nut driver for
your drill along the front of the unit
um now that I have it popped open you
can see better the there's these two
tabs you use a flat putty knife to slide
up and push it back and allows the top
to be released once the top is released
and you can lift it up um after you turn
the power off of course after the power
is off pull the
power and then you take the
unit and you flip the unit top
back and this one is got to spring it so
we're going to tape the top closed so it
won't flop open because since the pump
is coming on and I can hear the pump
most likely what our problem is if we
have something clogged inside the
drain if we do terrific we'll pull the
clog if there is damage to the unit from
there we will talk to the customer in
reference to repairing it properly um
but if it is
just a clog drain we'll remove the
debris put the unit back together and it
should operate properly from
there once you got it taped you can flip
it open let it set the tape will hold it
so the door doesn't flop better the top
doesn't flop back down on you so now
I've got the top up essentially what I
have to do is I have to
remove this top band inside here uh if
you look at it closely there's little
tabs all the way around the outside that
you're going to break pop loose with
your
fingers okay so now I was saying the
tabs the tabs go right inside these
little slots are on the plastic Rim you
pull them up so they'd come there's also
a
recirculating uh pump hose right here I
going to loosen that one
up just move it back so I can slide the
rubber piece off once that's sliding off
this whole top will come
loose once you remove the top down in
the tub there's going to be a cap a
center cap for the agitator this unit
you can see the center cap for the
agitator there's going to be a little
notch in it we're going use it to pop
the center cap off once the center cap
is popped off you're going to need to
remove this bolt we're going going to
have to pull the we're basically pulling
the agitator so we can get to the inner
tub and get that Loose as well and once
I get to the pump then I'm able to
loosen up or remove whatever may be
causing it to be
clogged once you have that screw
released
set that to the
side so once you removed the bolt and
the agitator in the bottom push down on
your inner tub see if it goes down if it
goes down pull back up on it you're
trying to dislodge it from the inside of
the unit um and you should be able to do
so cuz it should just come right out for
you so with the tub out I was able to
put my hand in here and I was able to
find a worker's glove which is down in
the water your pump is typically back
here on this back
side which is right
here don't necess I feel anything else
in there so I'm going to do now is I'm
going to tilt the unit back forward
top back
down top back down I'm going to plug the
unit back in and I'm going to see if we
have drainage now all right so what I've
done now is I know about where the pump
cover is inside so I've removed the two
screws okay once I removed the top I was
able to find a couple more coins down
inside there I'm going to do is I'm
trying to find and locate this grw head
that I just
dropped able to find
it I've located those I'm now going to
put the unit back down you just there a
couple uh coins down in where
the water drains out of so now we're
going to try again is we're going to try
to start this and spin it out
again I did that the last time where it
would fill just a little bit but
now hear it make
noise you still hear that pump TR trying
to
go and it is not so there's something
further down inside this
pump okay well it needs a drain this
unit needs a new drain pump so I'm going
to leave it um taking apart talk to the
customer about doing the repair and
we'll work from there okay so what we
found is that the unit needs a new pump
the pump is currently uh either tied up
with something or is burned out from
having a coin blocking the hole so
tomorrow when're going to make it back
I'm going to change the pump out uh to
do so you either a need to drink the
water out of the inside or B be prepared
for water to get on your floor when you
change your pump out you change the pump
from the bottom of the unit it does
Mount into place by two hoses and a
couple screws to mount to the bottom of
the outer basket
