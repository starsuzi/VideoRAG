- Hi Youtube friends!
- Hey everyone!
- Thank you for tuning
in to Cook with April!
Today I'm going to show you how to make
cream cheese frosting, which is a
delicious frosting for everything.
Cookies, cupcakes, the best is when I
make it with carrot cake.
I do have a recipe for carrot cake,
I'll have it in the description box below,
but stay tuned so you can learn
how to make this yummy frosting.
In a medium bowl, place room temperature
cream cheese as well as softened butter
and mix until creamy.
Then you're ready to gradually add
powdered sugar and mix
again with your hand mixer.
This is also a great
time to add a teaspoon of
vanilla extract if you like.
This is completely optional, but you can
also add food coloring if you'd like
a specific color to your frosting.
Now is a great time.
And again thoroughly mix with your
hand mixer until the color shows up.
And that is cream cheese frosting.
I hope that you enjoy.
Alrighty, so now the taste tester Justin
is here to try the cream cheese frosting!
I added some pink,
you can add any food
coloring you like, but,
here you go!
- Alright. Here we go.
Oh, this is so good.
I don't know why but cream cheese frosting
tastes so much better than store bought
just like regular frosting.
- [April] Yes!
- [Justin] I don't know why but
it just has, regular store bought frosting
just has that really
like artificial taste.
- And it's probably too sweet.
I add less sugar, just because I like
the cream cheese flavor
more so than the sugar.
- [Justin] Exactly,
yeah. So it's delicious.
My favorite thing that you make it with
is definitely the carrot cake.
It's just so good.
- So thank you friends
so much for watching,
I hope you enjoy this
yummy cream cheese frosting
and have a beautiful day!
Bye!
- [Justin] Bye.
