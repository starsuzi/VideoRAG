You say Yorkshire puddings and I think about
Sundays at home all the family around the
table they've got everything haven't they
they've got the crunch they've got that toastiness
on the outside but they've also got that pillowy
softness to them that can absorb the gravy
from the plate it's just a blanket of love
so I'm gonna show you guys my ultimate Yorkshire
pudding recipe I start by making my batter
and I'm gonna use flour eggs and milk so first
I beat my free range eggs in a large bowl
I add milk and beat it together next I sift
in my flour sifting the flour will help make
sure that the mix is smooth and there are
no lumps it also adds air to the mixture I
whisk this until it achieves the consistency
of single cream just like this it is key to
really give your batter a thorough whisk as
the gluten within the flour reacts with the
water from the eggs and the milk it forms
long mesh like molecule structures protein
from the eggs also aided by adding a stretchiness
to the mesh once thoroughly whisked I'm going
to pour it into each jug and leave it to rest
for 15 minutes now I've got time to focus
on what oil and oven, I need a preheated oven
so I'm popping the oven on at 230 Celsius
I'm going to fill a deep sided muffin tray
with 1 cm of oil per space using a high smoking
point oil then I pop the oil into the oven
to heat if you want to use different oils
check on the smoking points of your oil I'm
using vegetable oil so I'm going to heat the
oil for 15 minutes and lower the temperature
to 210 Celsius this is always my favourite
bit you've gotta be rapid take the oil out
the oven closing the door immediately, ready
your batter, to pour into the bubbling oil
this is super important if your batter doesn't
sizzle when you first pour it in the oil isn't
hot enough if it does you're on the right
road distribute your batter into all the pockets
of bubbling oil so picking up from the last
sciencey bit the protein type of mesh we whipped
up earlier is now capturing the evaporating
water from the milk and the eggs that steam
pushes up the batter encasing and this is
where the beautiful lift begins no time for
messing about here peeps you want to get this
straight into the oven to cook for another
15 minutes now to get perfect yorkies do not
open the door no peeking! we just want these
little babies to rise filling with gorgeous
air pockets that give Yorkshire puddings their
wonderful light texture I should also note
that having an oven that spreads heat evenly
is mega vital otherwise you may only end up
with half of them properly done so now these
bad boys are done you can serve them up with
anything turkey chicken pork but today it's
gonna be beef there's nothing like it light
fluffy and perfect for capturing gravy this
looks scrumy I've gotta try it baked to perfection
everything you want in a Yorkshire pudding
this is delicious but show me your yorkie
