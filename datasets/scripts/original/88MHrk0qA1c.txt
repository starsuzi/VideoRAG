Christmas special time of the year bit
like this bird this is a goose don't be
scared about cooking Goose at Christmas
because it really is a special treat
everyone's worried about the fat content
in there but the secret is is to get the
fat out and put flavor into it spice mix
now the most important thing about this
spice mix is making it sort of um zesty
going to start off with two lemons and
one
orange the secret of the oranges and
lemon it cuts the richness of the goose
I like serving the goose to the kids
because it's seen as a bit of a treat
and it's such a nice alternative to
Turkey
okay
oranges and lemons into the pest and
morar and then a tablespoon of rock
salt 2 tbsp of Chinese F
Spice
in and then bring all those flavors
together and just mix it down don't have
to go crazy
grind into a bit of a
paste already it smells very sort of
christmy spicy aromatic and fresh which
is really really
nice now mix is ready we're going to
score the
goose and start from the bottom of the
breast and just go
round
now don't go too deep you can just see
look it's still nice and white in there
if you've got a touch of red show and
then you've gone too deep you've gone
into the actual flesh just the fat turn
the bird around and start from the
bottom again so as the whole Goose has
got these little diamonds all over
it there you go look crisscrossed all
the way around now get the seasoning
and just rub it all over the
goose now when you have got time do this
the night before because a it takes a
lot of pressure off from the morning and
B all that flavor is far
deeper but treat it as if you're giving
your partner a real nice
massage you really want to go around the
goose
360° coat it completely in
spices you can you can actually start to
see the
diamonds get our oranges and lemons that
we zested cut them in half and then
stick them inside the goose and you know
what that smells delicious it's not even
roasted yet so now into a hot oven 250°
and then turn it down after 15 minutes
normally you'd cook a bird like this 15
minutes for every kilo so about an hour
and 20 minutes for the
Bird right half an hour before the goose
comes out bit of a chef's treat now
because this is gold dust we're now
going to get the goose fat because we
can use that for absolutely
everything the perfect roast potato or
even caramelizing past and goose
fat or sneak down at half 5 in the
morning and make yourself the most
amazing fried egg sandwich cooked in
goose fat hello the perfect Christmas
present and look Gold
Dust now we're going to give a second
layer of flavor we get some clear honey
now so just drizzle the
honey generously over the goose and what
it does now it just gives the bird a
little bit more sweet
weakness the secret about cooking a
goose perfectly is making sure the legs
and the breast are cooked evenly the
legs take longer to cook than the
breasts so open up the goose legs so it
all Cooks
evenly into the
oven and then half an hour
180°
perfect
the goose really important now to take
it out and leave it to rest you'd never
slice it piping hot absolutely crazy
because all the goodness runs out of it
so we cover it with Tim foil the reason
why we do this is to sort of make it
cool down slowly so we keep the heat in
there it doesn't cool down too fast and
then the carcass doesn't separate from
the meat so leave it to cool down for a
good 15 to 20
minutes
the most important thing when you come
to carve the goose is to make sure you
get rid of the awkward
Parts take off the wings and take off
the legs make your life
easier just lift it on its side and pull
the legs back and just wait for that
joint to pop out and then get your knife
and remove it from the bottom of the
carcass
look how easy I've made my life already
most important thing about carving is
feel comfortable with what you're doing
so turn the bird around make it work
around you don't work around the bird
take the knife and just slice all the
way down and lay them on top of the
Wings
beautiful we don't need to slice it
thick and each slice of goose has got
the that lovely roasted fat around the
outside that just tastes amazing the
best way to carve the leg is there's the
drum and there's the thigh just place it
down on the board and slice through the
drum get the bone and just pop it out
and slice through now you've got the
drum place the drum on the board and
just slice down all the way around and
look at it and this way we maximize on
our portions we don't waste any of the
meat that's what we want a nice clean
bone at the
end just have a look what came off that
one
goose and that now is ready for the
table and you can quite honestly say
Merry Christmas to you all you've now
cooked your goose
properly
