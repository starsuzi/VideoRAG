This is Susie and she's a Sansevieria. But
you might have heard her called a few
other things; she's also known as a snake
plant or a mother-in-law's tongue. She's
actually one of those rare plants that
gives out oxygen at night rather than
taking it in. This means that if you keep
her in your bedroom, she might even help
you sleep a little better. Susie's also
one of Patch's unkillable plants. She
hails from the deserts of western Africa
which means she actually prefers it if
you forget to water her occasionally. She
can put up with pretty much any light
level but she's happiest in bright light.

much water or light your house plant
needs, find Patch's Houseplant Parenting
