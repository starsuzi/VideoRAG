ladies and gentlemen my favorite snack
of all time Mom I love these babies with
some pigeon peas cooked in coconut gravy
hungry
yet start by adding flour sugar and cam
on to bowl followed by a mix of coconut
milk and instant yeast you want to form
a dough that's soft but not
sticky my dough was still sticky here
and all you need to do in this instances
add a little flour if this
happens turn you're back for 1 second
and here's an example of cooking with a
toddler in case you're wondering
no no I did not know there was a cookie
in my mixer but I will find out soon
enough it was at this precise moment
that I discovered something was wrong
with my
dough took me a while to get all the
pieces out thanks little
man I like to need my dough by hand for
a few minutes even after I take it out
of the
mixer cut your dough in
half and take each piece and cut it in
half again so you end up with four
pieces that should be
equal
technically form each piece of dough
into a round
Bowl okay semi round gosh I'm terrible
at
this transfer the dough pieces into a
lightly flowered container cover and
leave for an hour to
rise B
there we go nice and
fluffy next you want to roll out each
piece of dough into a disc shape and try
and get it as round as you
can yeah I'm definitely not getting any
words for Rolling
gosh cut your semi round discs into
triangles I usually cut it into four but
I have a toddler as you saw earlier and
he has itty bitty hands so the size is
ideal for him repeat this step with all
the pieces and
then cover and let them rise a second
time once your oil is ready which it
obviously wasn't here drop your dough
and move it around in the
oil you can check if your oil is ready
by putting a wooden skewer into the oil
and if bubbles form around it then
you're good to go now a crucial step in
making mamry is the frying there's a
method here that's important to note you
have to keep the Maham moving in the oil
the bit over a couple of times so that
it doesn't
crack if you can see I didn't flip it
over enough initially so it cracked
slightly um also moving it around in the
hot oil helps it puff up
once your mamry is golden brown take it
out and lay it on some kitchen paper to
get rid of excess
oil I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and
