this is Tom Hawk and welcome back guys
to another DIY video now today I going
to show you guys how to create
yourselves some
DIY Dr
Pepper ice
cream that's so good
need to spill it down with some more Dr
Pepper so let's move on to the kitchen
and show you guys how to make this so
here are the ingredients that we're
going to need to make our DIY Dr Pepper
ice cream so first of all what we're
going to need is some double cream now I
have got two of these they are 250
milliliters so we're going to use two of
those we're also going to have some
black food coloring that'll be good for
like dot pepper and Coca-Cola ice cream
too also we're going to have ourselves
some granulated sugar um we definitely
need some of this what else we've got
some salt and we have ourselves some
dark to Pepper of course it's the main
ingredient for this ice
cream we also are going to use a mixing
bowl and some of these little Beacon
like the like little glasses we also got
ourself this beautiful little cereal Bow
Box a cup this is an natural half cup a
whisk and a Pyrex measuring jug so first
of all what we need to do for this is we
need to add our cream
in so we got two lots of this remember
250 that's like 8 oz if you're
American one of them nicely in there
then the second one nicely in there look
at all that cream that is ridiculous
amount of cream in there so next what
we're going to do is going to grab some
sugar so we've got the half cup here
we're going to add four of them so
that's basically two normal cup
measurements but for this we've got four
cuz it's only half cup
measurement so there's
one
[Music]
two three
three
four so next what you want to do is you
need to grab your whisk and you need to
give it a good old whisker mix and mix
make sure you mix is all in it's very
sugary and creamy right there give it a
good old
mix get it all mixed up in
there so next we need to add a pinch of
salt a pinch nothing more than a pinch a
little bit of a Sprinkle up in there
little bit of a Sprinkle yeah that's
that's probably about enough that we'll
add a teeny bit more just a little bit
more of a Sprinkle right that's fine so
next we need to give a Wix whisk it
whisk it whisk it whisk it whisk it
whisk it whisk it keep mixing it all up
it's very important to mix up all the
sugar so it
dissolves next is the secret ingredient
Dr Pepper we're going to add about 250
ml in here if you are liking more of a
stronger Dr Pepper taste and add a
little bit more it is all down to your
preference for me I have only added 250
ml but you can add more to your
mixture so we're just going to pour this
into the bowl look at all that smells
absolutely amazing in there right time
to give it a good old whisk need to make
sure all the sugars are going to
dissolve and then we're going to grab
our food coloring and pop some of that
in because we want to make it look like
Dr Pepper so we need to add quite a fair
amount of black food col going in here
this should be enough this should be
enough hopefully this will turn it a
nice little black color uh we hope right
let's give it some
[Music]
mix there we go it's turning a little
bit I'm going to add a little bit more
so we get the perfect color in there
okay that's a little bit more yeah this
will work this will be fine it'll turn
it'll turn to a nice color there there
we go that's what we wanted that is a
perfect color for it let give it more of
a whiskey in there we'll get get
everything Blended up look at my foam my
foam's
covered so now what we need to do is we
need to leave to sit for 2 hours so the
ice cream has just been chilling here
for about 2 hours now what the plan is
is to put the ice screen mixture into
this little tub and then to put it into
this cereal box holder container this
normally keeps you cereal fresh and
stuff my idea is to put it inside of
here and fill it full of ice so let's
get this mixture into here without
spilling yeah I'm going to do a S sink
okay Tom do not spill it this is going
to go
[Music]
absolutely oh oh oh oh we got some lump
we got some
lump spill in a little
bit little bit more okay we still got a
whole load of mixure in there maybe I
should try and do two I have got two
containers okay so let's put the lid on
that
okay so now we've got our mixture inside
here now look at that that looks a
little bit like Dr Pepper I hope as long
as it tastes like doed pepper I'm not
first right so we've got our cereal box
container here we going to pop the
mixture inside there just so you guys
can see right the next step is what we
need to do is need to grab some
ice now where's the
hole there it is right so we're just
going to fill this all of ice
make sure we get it down both sides of
the ice
cream okay so there's a lot of ice
around it there next what we need to do
is this is where the magic happens we
need to add the salt so we've got here
some sea salt now I have seen other
YouTubers do this and they've use
something called ice cream pal salt now
all that essentially is is rock salt so
if you can get a hold of some rock salt
that's what you want to do just put
loads in
there give it a mix around
[Music]
sure you get it
everywhere all down the sides right then
next you want to add some more ice in
there fully freeze that in there let's
put the whole bag
in add some more
salt okay now all that's in there what
we want to do is we want to grab the top
of it put the container lid on make sure
it's nice and
tight so all we have to do now is shake
this and then we're going to get
ourselves some delicious Dr Pepper ice
cream ice ice cream ice cream
ice now you need to do this for about 20
minutes it's going to be a long 20
minutes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
right it has been two and a half hours
of shaking this tub this is how people
used to make ice cream back in the day
