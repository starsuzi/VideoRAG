Well, first of all this plant is yellow.
Most of the nutrients are back down into the
root and I'm going to dig down and if it is
not the size of at least my pinky, I don't
want it because it's too small for me.
I use this digger to start exposing the root.
Being that it has a little bulb on this side,
I'm going to say that it has maybe a prong,
no, I think this will be alright.
I also use this to pry tree roots up.
I want to get as much of this root as I possibly
can.
There we go.
There's my pinky.
I know this root is probably going to weigh
9 - 10 grams.
I snap this off, put this in my man purse
and then every time I dig one, I always want
to put twenty seeds back in the ground.
But being there is a lot of ginseng in this
area, I will go...I'll find a place there
isn't that many...possibly here.
There's my ten berries.
