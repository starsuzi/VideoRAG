Oh
all right so today thanks Evan we're
going to be making a stir-fry it's an
all vegetable stir-fry no meat so this
can be one of your meatless Monday's so
it's a sweeter stir-fry I add brown
sugar to the sauce and what-have-you
make sure that you don't skip out on
fresh ginger and fresh garlic it makes
all the world of difference to me in
Asian dishes especially a stir-fry I
have a couple of ingredients you can do
it a simpler way my kids love this dish
even though it's all vegetables they
like to pair theirs with noodles there
was mommy can we have to stir fry I love
to pair my with rice so either/or is
just fine all I'm going to show is the
vegetables owns a ton of vegetables
there's an easier way to do it if you
don't want to if you don't have all the
ingredients that I have on here just do
the soy sauce with the brown sugar and
the ginger and the garlic and it'll come
out just fine um that's just another
creative way to do it after then we'll
and daven with so many different Asian
dishes because I love Asian food um this
is something that I came up with and I
just hope you like it I hope you enjoy
it as much as we do hey don't forget to

let's go okay so with my vegetable
stir-fry these are my ingredients as far
as my vegetables I do broccoli carrots
purple cabbage and onion and then when I
do my oil I'll do coconut oil and then
to the coconut oil in order to season it
I add garlic and ginger and then do to
the rest of my ingredients I need Myriam
sauce soy sauce red pepper flakes brown
sugar and this is a
tamarind sauce so those are my
ingredients for
my vegetable
stir-fry let's go okay so all my
ingredients are chopped I have onion
cabbage
carrots and
my broccoli now I'm going to heat up my
wok and I'm going to add the coconut oil
the ginger and the garlic okay now as
far as garlic I have two large cloves of
garlic okay and then I have a tiny piece
pretty small piece of ginger now the
garlic
myth
like I always do
and like I always say y'all fresh
ingredients makes food taste that much
better
okay so along with the garlic I'm adding
that piece of ginger I'm just using a
cheese grater and grate it on the cheese
grater the best I can
I already did most of it and it wasn't
recording for some reason so I'm going
to take this ginger I'm just going to
add it to the garlic
okay so while I'm warming up my walk I'm
gonna add about four tablespoons one
two
three
four of coconut oil and the reason I'm
adding so much is because I have a ton
of vegetables and we're just going to
warm that up so that we can get our
ginger and our garlic going
okay so now I'm going to add my onions
first
just so they're on the bottom
hook it up a little bit
see
I'm going to add everything else except
for my broccoli my broccoli I do laughs
because I don't like overcook broccoli I
like my broccoli to be like perfectly
tender
you
I like a lot of rock they must right I
mean it's just good to have all these
vegetables my kids eat this they love it
even my one-year-old and whenever I say
we're gonna have stir-fry nobody
complains so it's a wonderful dish
especially to get vegetables in
I don't even add meat to it that's how
good it is no egg no chicken no beef no
nothing I mean you can always do that
I'm sure to be absolutely wonderful but
this is the way okay now for the sauce
so soy sauce first first things first
we're going to do about 1/3 cup of soy
sauce and that's because I have a lot of
edges for stuff okay so that's about 1/3
cup
and we're going to do about tablespoon
of the tamarind sauce
almost out of this
I usually go measure by measuring just
for you guys
coming out but I'm gonna do bout
tablespoon of Mirror Mirror I probably
pronounced all this stuff wrong but
about Marysol's
and we're gonna do 2 tablespoons of
brown sugar
1/2
and we're going to add about
red pepper flakes it gives it a nice
kick because it's like a sweet lips
sweet but spicy kick I guess you can say
I will say at about 1/8 a a teaspoon of
red pepper flakes okay
that's just me doing what I do ok we're
going to stir everything together
and we're going to pour it onto the
vestibules
look how beautiful it looks
that beautiful
goodness so now I'm going to add the
sauce to it and it's pretty much
done and
we're going to go for man
so you just pour it on
and then you're going to start
everything together
and it's wonderful you guys
to my own creation once again
just mix of flavors take the stuff and
just it's wonderful so there you have it
you have your homemade stir fry tons of
veggies and it's absolutely delicious
now I'm going to pair mine I paired it
with the noodles because my kids love
noodles I'm going to here my rice I love
mine with veggies and rice it's filling
stomach don't hurt after you beat but
it's wonderful
so oh oh my god
you
