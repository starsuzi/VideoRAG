try this do it yourself lupia with my
mom
put ground pork in a bowl then add
your ingredients
which is water chestnut
carrots
garlic and onion
this is chicken powder
but black pepper
it's up to you guys if you don't want um
that much carrots on it it's up to you
if you don't want to put too much so
that's how easy it is
after all the ingredients are mixed
cover it and put in the refrigerator for
an hour the flavor can soak in the meat
you can be creative whatever you like
you can add shrimp
and add
like a white shrimp not the tiger shrimp
because that's
uh kind of chewy so while we're waiting
for that we're gonna peel the we're
gonna teach you how to
separate the lumpia wrapper
this is really really thin
so you have to do it really slowly
you can do it fast
otherwise you're gonna repeat what
you're gonna do you cut it in half
[Music]
okay tablecloth is clean
so but usually you can do this in bulk
right yep
[Music]
we use the egg to wrap the lumpia
wrapper
take about two tablespoons of the
mixture and spread it horizontally at
the end of the wrapper
secure the meat by folding the wrapper
and also tucking in the ends
[Music]
roll it up and secure it with egg yolk
[Music]
do
[Music]
so we're ready to fry the egg roll
it's advisable for you to use vegetable
oil or canola oil
so make sure the heat is medium to high
heat
not too hot because if you do it too hot
your lumpia will burn and the insides
will still be raw
you could freeze the uncooked ones
yeah you can freeze it up to
two months
and then just fry when you're ready so
there you go that's the simple way to
make lumpia
and i love to have it with
this
sweet chili sauce it's delicious with
that so that's it i hope you guys enjoy
thanks again mom
you're welcome
oh hi
hmm
um
[Music]
so here's how i like to do it
i'll grab a little bit and i don't like
it to make it too thick
and i just straight up use my fingers
take it
i'll start rolling it
fold in the inside
and then i just dip my finger in here
like this
it's a little messier but
i like to do things fast
voila
is that pretty
much look at this outfit no my mom said
that hers looks prettier
might just
one cup of chopped carrots one chop
