There are many ways to enhance the outdoor
space of a residential property.
It's fairly common to see paver patios, outdoor
kitchens, water features, landscape lighting,
even entertainment systems.
Fire features are another enhancement that
have become more and more popular over the
years.
Today these fire features can be added more
easily and affordably using RTF ready to finish
products, like the 36 and 42 inch modular
outdoor fireplace kits.
Recently we spoke to our resident RTF expert,
Bryan Hensley, to learn more about the product.
One of the benefits of the RTF fireplace kit
is it's fully welded construction broke up
into modules.
The entire unit shows up on two pallets that
are already assembled into four core units
and four additional add on units.
The only tools that are required to assemble
this is a drill, a level, and a number two
Phillips bit.
Because of the materials used in this kit,
the product's very safe.
It is one hundred percent class A noncombustible
materials.
Starting with a 16 gauge galvanized steel
sub frame and clad with a ceramic cement board
exterior.
That ceramic cement board is tested at 62
hundred degrees Fahrenheit with an acetylene
torch.
RTF literally stands for ready to finish,
meaning that it's going to allow you the flexibility
you need to match any of your finish materials
to those found on the job site.
This may include stucco, natural stone, or
manufactured stone.
The real benefit of the RTF system is its
time in construction.
You can have this unit ready for veneer in
less than an hour, as opposed to days if not
weeks using traditional construction methods.
You can imagine the labor savings alone.
As you heard from Bryan the RTF outdoor modular
fireplace kits are relatively simple to construct
compared to traditional methods.
After marking off the location for the fireplace
on a solid level foundation you'll start the
assembly process by removing the insert from
the firebox.
To do this remove the screws attaching the
three panels that surround the insert and
set the panels out of the way.
Be sure to save the screws for later use.
Next, remove the screws from the tabs securing
the insert to the sub frame.
Once this is done you can slide the insert
out and set it to the side.
The insert is fairly heavy, so be careful
when removing it.
The four components of the traditional RTF
fireplace kit are simply stacked then secured
to each adjoining section using the included
screws.
Begin by setting the hearth into place and
use composite shims to level it if necessary.
This is followed by placing the firebox on
top of the hearth, making sure that the base
is fitted into the cut-out on the top side
of the hearth.
Secure the two sections together with the
self tapping screws.
The sweep can then be assembled next in the
same fashion.
The chimney will be installed at a later time.
Now you can reinstall the insert and secure
it to the frame.
Do not replace the surrounding masonry boards
at this time.
Each kit comes with two sets of flue pipes,
one set longer than the other.
Each set has a small and large diameter pipe.
Install the long, small diameter pipe first
by dropping it down through the hole at the
top of the sweep.
The end with the locking tabs should be at
the top.
Press the bottom end securely into the flue
at the top of the fire insert.
Install the large diameter section in the
same manner, except that the end with the
locking tabs should be at the bottom.
The chimney section can now be attached to
the top of the sweep.
This section is slightly rectangular so make
sure you have it positioned correctly.
Once the chimney is in place you can install
the last sections of the flue pipe in the
same manner as the longer set.
The short sections will snap onto the top
of each longer section.
Once the flue pipes are in place you can then
replace the cement boards that surround the
fire insert.
The screws used for the ceramic cement board
panels are different from the shorter stainless
screws for the sub frame so be sure to use
the correct ones.
If you are using the optional wood boxes be
sure that they are plumb and level with the
hearth and firebox.
They will be secured to the main fireplace
by mortar or stucco during the finishing process.
At this point the RTF fireplace is ready to
finish with the veneer of choice.
Once the finish has been applied the last
component to be added is the exhaust cap to
the top of the flue pipe.
Finally, in order to provide the needed flow
of air to move smoke up through the flue the
fire insert manufacturer recommends installing
ventilation just above the hearth on the back
side of the firebox.
Vents are included in the kit with detailed
instructions for installation.
The RTF modular outdoor fireplace kit is an
easy and affordable way to enhance any outdoor
space.
Best of all, it can be done in a fraction
of the time of traditional block construction
methods.
