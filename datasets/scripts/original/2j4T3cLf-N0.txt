okay this video step-by-step how I make
bread enchiladas from my friend Linda in
Tennessee Kirtland I just cook these
chili pods
so he says New Mexico hot chili and then
I used to tear the heads off and throw
the seats in the trash but my aunt make
the of Angie showed me that you can
throw them in the pot and you put water
in the pot and they turn to mine and I'm
gonna let them boil some people like to
cover them some don't just depends how
hot they are and if I don't I don't
cover it at first but if the chili gets
too hot and if my grandbabies in the
house they put a lid on it but just boil
them till they're nice and soft
oh as the chili cooks like that I get my
tongs and they move them around like go
in the pot it's a nut at the bottom on
top so they all get stuck shall we bring
two ladders
it's almost ready you could tell it's
ready when it turns up right red and
they're very soft see how they're soft
and bright red compared to this dark but
see this dark one is still dark so I
move the bright red ones to the top and
my dark ones to the bottom here's a
troll waiting for enchiladas and right
okay this is how you make Spanish rice
during my rice so it gets a bit Brown
good time recently my fair lady
okay now I'm gonna get some of these
the cumin ground cumin powder I just do
a pinch Tomatoes
chicken breasts
baby business the garlic
hey the cumin
season
filling it tomato paste
chicken breath
and I'm doing this with me
cover it turn your back excuse me excuse
me I put the lid
it's a 375 Spanish rice I hear that on
high for 25 when typical even added
letter in the chicken broth once it
starts boiling I'm going to put it down
let it cook about 30
today the rice is boiling and like
winning down
275 the chili pods are done I just turn
them up okay the Chili's done so what I
do and my lady ready
I get the chili up see how it's topping
get the heads off and I put all the
chili
when I say heads I mean these hands
right here it's up to you if you like
hot chili or not we do
so I leave all the seeds in I don't need
take the head about for everything else
goes in there but not the water okay I
just need my room cuz I'm on my iPhone
right okay since I like hot chili soda
thankful since all this is just juice
that's in the parent is push juice
here's the the heads that I pinched off
the chili and the chili with the seeds
by in the blender see it's just the
chili pots with all the seeds because if
I like new chili hot okay then I get
water and I just pour it in enough to
cover the the chili
okay then I get some sea salt
and then I get some of this garlic that
I use for my Spanish rice its garlic
gonna put that in okay so I got my
little spoon plenty of garlic the more
garlic for less hot the more salt
the more hot is so why don't hire
you have more small that you want it
less read more better okay and then I
just start to blend it make sure you
live
till he's done he's all nice and smooth
so then I get some olive oil I put it in
a small pan to make my factor theorem
and she got honest I put a little bit of
olive oil and a bigger pan from the
chilli sauce and my right side and
Abel's doing the Sun hello hello

Chile pen and a lot of olive oil from
the cords of beers
spend 30 minutes okay and then my chili
some people add flour to that pan of oil
