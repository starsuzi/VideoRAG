welcome back to my chaos everyone today
we are taking on the octopus hoodie I
got from dress Lily a few months back
that did not fit me it was too tight in
the collar it was too tight around the
arms and it was just a size too
small so we're going to take with the
side seams we are going to take off the
hood and we are going to fix the
collar and we are going to be awesome
doing it I've never done this before so
I'm just hoping it works but I can't
wear it as it is so I got to do
something all right the first thing
we're going to do is we're going to take
out the side seams from the waist to The
Wristband on both sides I left my w
waistband I left my waistband and my
wristband both intact I did not cut
them and I used whatever method I could
I used the seam ripper I used scissors
and I used a tiny pair of scissors just
do what you ever H just do whatever you
have to to get it
done once that's all out
I you can once that's all out you can
see here what it looks like big open
side on the left big open side why did
you get it if it's a size too small and
I took the hoodie and opened it up from
shoulder to shoulder and it's still
attached in the back so I didn't take
the whole thing
out now find yourself the middle of your
hoodie mark it with a piece of Taylor's
chop
and make a 1 and 1/2 in cut right down
the middle I say it's 1 and 1/2 in I
didn't really measure I just kind of
like cut a little cut and then I figured
if it's too small I can just make a
bigger cut later but if it's too big I'm
kind of screwed because you can't
exactly make a big cut smaller it it
don't work like that
I cut myself a 3in wide band of black
black fabric for each side of the hoodie
now once I had that done I pinned it
into place on one side and sewed it
[Music]
up and when I sewed the other side I
just let the
fabric sew itself
into a triangle at the bottom where the
wrist and the
um the waistband
was so it just kind of like tapers off
instead of just mix a square and
stopping abruptly
so it's really hard to explain what I
did but I'm not exactly sure what I
did and you do that to both sides
I didn't feel safe or confident enough
in my skills it's going to put a
straight line on this hoodie for the
neck like an actual V so I did um a soft
v-neck without any sharp angles and I'm
glad I did cuz it was a heck of a lot
easier I just cut it down a bit more
with the
[Music]
scissors I surg the hood back to the
sweater when I really should have just
outright sewed it like normal but you
know live and learn cuz then afterwards
I had to actually go over and REO it
again because the serger had skipped a
few small places
then sew yourself a top stitch in the
color mat matching your fabric that you
have the best cut off all your loose
threads and voila you are
done this process not knowing what I was
doing when I went into it probably took
me about 2
hours
but it was worth it because now I have
something that fits me and I can wear it
and I love it and I'm trying to talk
myself out of actually buying a purple
one so I can turn it into like a zipup
hoodie in the front because I don't need
two octopus hoodies I mean I could
definitely wear two of them but I don't
need to my God I love
it the dancing is not acting I am really
just that
happy oh my God I'm just happy I love it
I love it I love it I love it I love it
I love it I love it I love it I wish I
had done this
when it first came in instead of just
letting it hang in my
closet in the hopes that I'll lose 20
lbs magically by doing absolutely
nothing anyway I thank you everybody and
I will see you next week hopefully with
another video bye
