hello everyone this is B Denia and today
I'm going to make a tutorial of how I
make my crab meat very simple I do this
all the time when I do like a a little
gathering in my house and it tastes
really really good um few ingredients
that's all you need
and I wanted to tell you something
yes okay when you do this recipe it is
you know important that when you make it
leave it in the refrigerator for at
least 4 hours before you serve it or it
is better if you do it a day before like
I'm doing because I'm having company
tomorrow so I want to do it today for
tomorrow all those flavors could be
infused into that crab salad and it
really tastes good the next day but
let's say if you don't have no time it's
good to serve this within like 4 hours
you got to make sure that you let all
the oils and vinegars marinate you know
so it could soak into the crab meat so
let's get
started we got here a pack of crab
meat and I'm going to show it to
you all right this is the pack but you
know what this is the first time I'm
actually buying this pack pack I usually
buy another you know pack another brand
so it just goes to show that yes you can
buy any kind of crab meat like this let
me show it to
you it looks like this and it's going to
I'll show you how to you know break it
apart and all that other stuff which is
really really
simple they do have to crab meat in like
cans I would not suggest you buy from
the can when you're going to do this
recipe I would suggest you buy it like
this
okay so there goes a pack of that and I
got here some veggies I got here some
red peppers green peppers yellow pepper
and red onions I got here which I'm
going to show you better um salad olives
and I chose these specifically because
as you can see it has the little you
know the peppers inside and it
has you know all the olives nice and
chopped so it really helps me out a lot
I I will suggest you buy that you don't
have to buy the Goya ones you could buy
any kind I'm just saying you know and
right here I have extra virgin olive oil
I got here a little bottle of lemon
juice I have here some salt some pepper
and if you look in the back we got some
White vinegar so this is all you need to
make this recipe so let's get started I
wanted to quickly show you how it looks
when it comes out of the package so as
you can see well it'll break apart once
I pull it but comes out like this okay
and you pull it out like this okay now
I'm just going to do a little bit for
you and I'm going to finish the rest off
camera so what I do is
which let me get my little
knife you put
oops okay I did a boo
boo you could
um do the side like this hole I think
that's just too too much crab to just
take in one bite I like mine is small
pieces for you could mix in with the
vegetables and the olives so I like to
cut mine
like little bite size like
that hold
on we do another one so you can see more
or less how I am doing and it it it it
pulls apart like nothing you see like
nothing so it's not like you're going to
struggle with
it so right here right here while you're
mixing it it also tends to break a
little bit more apart so don't doing no
more than
this as you can see one more and that's
it so this is what you want to do just
in case you don't get to see it in the
lighting like that you don't
want a big piece of crab let's
say like the oops wait one
fell okay sorry you guys it's really
slippery
you don't want it like this size you
know want cute little bike size well you
know all the onions and peppers could
blend in beautifully together so I will
be doing this and then I'll show you how
to mix everything
up so I have my um pot here and I'm
going to do it here
um rather than do it here I was going to
mix it here but I want like a bigger pot
for me to really get in there and really
mix everything well then I will put it
back in here so as you could see I did
um cut them into little
pieces okay beautiful bits let me put it
back cuz you know this camera
sucks and hold
on okay
so all right and I'm sorry the water is
running but I am making food um um for
tomorrow and I'm just prepping here and
there yeah hold
on okay so I'll put this aside I made a
lot because me and my friend we love
Seafood so um I'm basically going to
eyeball everything but more or less you
do it to your tasting if you feel like
it needs a little bit more vinegar by
all means add it if you feel like it
need a little bit more salt
added you know stuff like that so I'm
going to add all the veggies
first put this
aside I'm going to add some
pepper and I am going to add a decent
amount of pepper I forgot to even add
parsley oh my goodness hold on I now got
to go to the pantry and get the parsley
oh my goodness hold
on and I got dry parsley but if you got
fresh parsley M by all
means
um I'm not going to lie I probably even
would have added some
cilantro but I think my friend had told
me she don't like cilantro so that's why
I'm not going to add it so you could do
this in in a a in a variety of ways okay
if you want to add fresh parsley go
ahead if you want to add um fresh
cilantro go ahead you know I would have
added I'm going to be honest I would
have added the cilantro and I have but
I'm not going to add it because I'm
making this for my friend as well so
this is how I'm making it today I'm just
giving you guys a suggestion and I got
here parsley oh my goodness is it really
finished I'll be back to see if I got
more my
pantry okay so
[Music]
unfortunately my parsley
finished anyway I'm going to have to add
more
tomorrow because I am not going to the
store so as you saw I added just a few
parsley flakes I didn't get to add what
I really wanted to add but it's okay
because tomorrow I'll take this out of
the refrigerator and I still got to cook
a little bit more more tomorrow and I'll
be able to add more so no biggie um I
got here some salt don't go crazy on the
salt just add a little
bit because this is going to be
marinating for like well I'm doing it
today and it's for tomorrow so you know
I don't want to add too much salt and I
got here a little bit of
lemon
juice I'll probably still call my friend
and ask her she want want me to ask
cantop because I should have SW she told
me she don't like none but I could be
wrong I'm going to bang this so excuse
the
noise I'm going to ask her and if she
likes you know like if she wants me to
add it then I'll add
it okay and I got here
my
Spanish my my not Spanish um olives um
my my my Al that's how we say it in
Spanish and this is salad olives so I'm
not going to
lie I like a
lot they don't like it and I'm going to
add some of the juice too cuz that
little juice believe me makes it nice
and good I like olives a lot everything
I could eat like this out of the
jar okay one more
[Applause]
yes okay back to
this I'm going to add some extra verin
olive
oil I do a little at a time and then I
like I mix it around and if I feel like
I need to add maybe a little bit more
then I'll add a little bit
more and white
vinegar I'll add a little bit of this
too okay there a lot in this I go
I
mean sorry I
cursed in
Spanish
okay now let me mix this
[Music]
up you know what I also forgot I add
corn to
mine as weird as it may
sound so I'm also going to add a can of
corn with this or at least half a can
matter of fact let me get it
now I got here a can of corn and I'm so
sorry that I didn't add this in the very
beginning you know of you know sometime
I tell you what you need for a recipe
and sometime out of nowhere I be like oh
snap I forgot this or that it's just
that I'm food prepping today and
sometime when you're doing like five or
six different kind Foods it it it
sometime get a little distracting
because you know I got to always go back
and forth in the refrigerator back and
forth into the pantry so pardon me and
this is optional if you only want to
make it the way I you see it right here
like this it tastes good just like this
as well
but I like to add corn and it really
does tastes good it gives it a little
sweeter taste to
it and
I even add some of the
juice to
it don't even criticize trust me make it
and you'll know that it'll taste good so
I'm only going to add just a little bit
you want as much juice as you can in
there so let me get
a let me get some
corn and I make this all the time all
the time but I'm not going to lie I
haven't made this in a few
months my older son was like Mom I want
you to make the crab salad so I was like
you know what my friends is coming
tomorrow I'm going to make
it
and all
right I'm going to taste it and then I'm
going to see if it needs to be more
stuff in here I'll probably add more
Olive
and more onions
though and I'm going to text my friend
to see if she wants me to add a
cilantro so that I'm going to do
first
okay and I have onions in the
refrigerator give me a minute
[Music]
see I just cut this for this and look I
need
more okay I should just add the whole
freaking
thing all
[Music]
right all right let me mix this up
you some fresh parsley would have really
brought out this recipe right
here
okay all right
let's let's taste
it
okay want to get it in the bottom cuz
that's where all the juices is at you
know the oil vinegar
tastes really good I'm about to have a
little bowl
myself but I am going to add
more um I am going to add more oil
vinegar and lemon juice because to me
this is supposed to have a little juice
in the bottom see wait a minute let me
see if I can show see that little juice
right
there this is really supposed to be like
the kind of like the salad dressing to
this and to me it's not enough
and we want that soaked in a little bit
in
there so I will be adding more and this
is a really a big pack of crab
meat and I'm not going to lie I'm going
to add a little bit more salt just a
little and definitely lemon
juice
okay and
white
vinegar let's mix this up
now see
look you see that in the bottom that's
what you want all the way in the bottom
that's your salad dressing right there
for this
crab so if it don't look like that it
don't got that juice you got to keep
adding more I'm just showing you how I
do it because I eyeball everything as
you know
and I don't want you to get confused
so again I'm going to taste it which I
don't
[Applause]

okay mm perfect just like
that yes
you could
taste you could taste everything you
could taste the oil the vinegar the
lemon juice you could taste you know
everything the olives everything is
perfect I'm glad that I added more to
this I'm going to call my friend and see
if she likes cilantro or I can add it in
front of you guys so you can see how
pretty it looks if not then I'm going to
come back to the camera and let you guys
know and put this in a nice Bowl so you
can see how it looks like
okay so my friend is not replying to
me and while I'm recording I'm seeing
that little button that says I need to
recharge my battery so I'm going to turn
this off and try to recharge my battery
and
um record with my
iPhone so I'm placing it in this bowl
and like I said some of them are going
to still fall apart because that's what
crap meat do
so let me put it all in
there just wanted to show
you
okay see that juice add all of that in
[Music]

okay put this to the side and this is
the crab salad what I'm going to do is
I'm going to cover it up with plastic
foil with plastic wrap not foil and I'm
going to show you how I'm going to do
mine with cilantro next okay so this is
the
salad I'm so happy and ecstatic about
it and this is it and I added my
cilantro in there I just chopped some
off rough chop and I just put it in
there and this is going to be mine which
I'm not going to lie I'll probably have
a little bowl of it I can't take it I
can't wait till tomorrow but this is
better served the next day I'm telling
you with all the oil vinegar lemon juice
the juice of the Corn the juice of the
olive um the salad olives it just makes
a Perfect Blend and all you need is salt
vinegar and a few veggies that's it so
