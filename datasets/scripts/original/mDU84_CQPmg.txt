Hi there! It's Rosanne from Country Chic Paint!
In this video I would like to show you
how to expose the natural wood color
underneath your painted piece of
furniture. My favorite technique for this
is using
sandpaper or a sanding block and I'll
show you how to do that in this video,
so stay tuned!
 
 
In another video I showed you how to paint the upholstery
of this chair, so make sure to check out
our other videos if you want to learn how
to paint upholstery.
The wood of this chair is painted in
Summer Blueberries
one of our limited edition colors and
I'm going show you how to distress it!
For this is distressing technique, you will need
the following supplies:
fine grit sandpaper, sanding blocks
or sanding sponges
and a damp cloth
Before distressing your piece, you want to make
sure that your paint
has dried very well so I would recommend
waiting at least 24 hours
If you're painting a previously oil-based
paint
then I would suggest giving it a bit more
time so maybe even three or four days
before you start distressing, so that you give your paint a good
chance to adhere well to the surface.
Instead of using sandpaper, I like using
sanding blocks
and sanding sponges.  You could also use
sandpaper and even
just tear a piece off and wrap it around
your sanding block
Sanding blocks are just a lot easier to hold in
your hands than
sandpaper by itself. So we're going to
simply take our sanding block and start
distressing
 
You want to make sure that you're using
a fine grit sandpaper
because you don't want to see scratch
marks that come with coarse sandpaper
It won't look natural. While distressing,
focus on areas that get natural wear and tear
 
such as edges and any details that are
sticking out
Not everybody is going to like the same
kind of distressed look
but if you're doing this for your own
furniture then you can't really go
wrong with it
Simply keep distressing until you like
what it looks like
if you find you've taken off too much
paint, then you can always paint a little
over the section that you've distressed too
much
I hope you enjoyed this video
