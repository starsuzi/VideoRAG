done at Lisa guo's office here now we're
taking on the back deck you'll notice
that's a composite deck and uh you do
not use a power washer to clean a
composite
deck uh unless you want to avoid the
manufactur warranty and I don't think
you want to do that so what we use is a
product we get out of Canada it's
friendly little bacteria called
bt200 and what it does is it uh
digests the algae grow in the wood lifts
it up out of there and then we'll gently
R it rinse it off so we'll uh we'll let
you watch this progress as we go about
doing this deck here this
afternoon done here on the table we've
already put it on the table and you can
see already it's starting to loosen and
digest the green algae so check back
with you here a little bit as we make
progress here here's the
rail
