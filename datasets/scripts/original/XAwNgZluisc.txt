good morning YouTubers this is
Eric it's been quite quite a while since
I haven't upload a video I used to
upload him like every week but I've been
busy and then I haven't been able to
upload anything well today I'm going to
upload this video because I want to uh
take a video
about the old tile you know this is a
Monier LIF
tile uh this is from the 30s from the
50s actually from the
50s this is the old Monier uh lifestyle
it was discontinu a long time ago even
the rakes are bigger now you see the
trim they're bigger than the regular
trim so for you to find a matching trim
for this it's almost
impossible and they don't make it
anymore so I'm going to take this little
video because uh I'm going to power
watchh this house uh whenever you have
like this kind of tile this is standard
weight somebody comes to your house and
tell you that he wants to replace it for
a
lightweight I don't really recommend it
what I really recommend you it's uh just
to power wash it and the worst case
scenario if you have um damage
underlayment you can just uh remove the
tiles um replace the damage wood dry Rod
termite damage cracked whatever and then
I install two layers of felt either 40
lb 30 lb or the best you know uh replace
it with
u peeling stick under layment or
something similar you know if you put a
peling stick under layment under your
tile it's mostly you're never going to
have to do anything to your tile anymore
because the peeling stick is going
to is going to keep it waterproof the
peling stick under layment it's a self
uh it's a self- prooof under l so it's a
system itself so anyway um you see even
the Dormers they're different those
Dormers they don't make them anymore now
they're like round they're they're round
uh L like Louver Dormers in this area
it's the area of
uh this is uh Westminster no actually
this is Fountain Valley in Southern
California about one mile from here it's
a Huntington Beach and
three miles from here is the the ocean
anyway I'm going to power wash it
because the owners they don't like the
look they said it looks a old but it's a
normal thing because you have a lot of
trees around here you have pine trees
you have palms palms tree pine trees you
have all kinds of trees so that all the
create The Moldy looking on your roof
but to me it looks beautiful it looks
old it looks styl but some people they
want to see stuff new so and I'm here
just to power wash it and whoever tells
you that they're going to add some
chemical to cure the tile to uh to
uh to prevent the
uh the uh the mold to you know the all
the green stuff to uh grow in your tile
that's with all the respect I mean
excuse my language that's
that's not true that's a lie you know
this is a brand new tile this is when it
was installed it comply with tittle 24
and everything but so after 30 40 years
it gets like that so if you power wash
it it's going to last you probably for
15 20 years
clean and then after that it's going to
start getting like that so so don't
believe everything they say some people
they just want to get the jobs and you
know I mean I understand every everybody
has to make a living but some of us you
know they make a living in a good for a
good cause you know we do what we have
to do and we do it because we know how
to do it and some people they just go
out there and tell you a bunch of Lies
they don't even back up their their
workmanship they don't even back up you
know what they do so for those people uh
I don't think they're doing it right
because it's not true what they say okay
so but anyway I'm going to take a video
and right now I'm changing all the
damage wood I mean I'm changing I'm
changing all the damage tiles and I fix
some um damag wood on the side uh I put
a u i sto the uh tile pen because all
that wood it was rot and back in the
days they didn't use no no no tile pens
on that little detail I'm going to show
you later on how I did it
okay and this kind of tille is so strong
that you know you can even walk in the
middle you see in the center you see in
the center is hollow so there's nobody
this is so strong so please if you have
this kind of tile if your house was
built in the 19
the
1950s
30s and you have this kind of tile where
your house is over 30 years old don't
change the tile okay don't because back
in the days they didn't use lightweight
lightweight was not available so
everything was was standard weight so
keep that tile worst case scenario you
can get a you can get someone to power
wash your house and then paint it and
you can have a tile over and over and
over just go to McDonald's go to Burger
Kings and you you can see the tile how
they paint it to match the color of the
of their logos so the same thing you can
do with your tile you don't have to
replace it the the only thing you have
to replace it is your under layman if
you have a damage uh damage underlayment
but as long as you don't have a broken
tile you can stay there for a lifetime
so please guys uh be wise when you uh in
invest about your house don't waste your
money and this is your investment all
right greetings and and I'll see you
later on in this video I'm going to show
you when whenever you're securing a tile
to to the old tile you only have to put
silicon on the channel and silicone on
the other channel so when the silicone
dries out the these two tiles that are
nailed down are going to hold the tail
in place so this is what I do put it
like that and then you just push push it
until the uh the bottom of the
tile gets even with the
with the line of tile you see it like
that and once the silicone dries out
it's not going to it's not going to come
off okay guys so right here I have a
broken
tile uh I'm going to show you how to
remove
it I don't usually have time to record
videos anymore because uh been busy but
today I have the time so I'm taking this
video what I'm going to do here I'm
going to switch a tile from from from
the back of the house to the front of
the house because this is the front of
the house so people don't want to
see most of the people they
[Music]
want make sure you get a wire brush see
like this so so it's going to remove all
the all the dirt
okay make sure you clean
the the channel on the old tile
and then you apply silicon here okay you
only have to apply here a little bit you
don't have to apply a lot because this
is standard weight it weighs 10 pounds
per per tile 10 10.5 something like that
so you have to put a lot of them
actually weighs more than than 10 pounds
because one square of tile usually has
88 tiles so 88 tiles weigh about 1,000
lbs so weights a lot okay and then you
when this one uh when this Channel
interlocks with this one it'll stick and
this channel is going to interlock with
the other one it's going to stick
together and then from here you just put
it in place like
this that's it and then uh right here
you lift it up and just push it push
push push push it
simple
see if you can't you can use pull you
Hammer like
this that's it that's it okay and
tomorrow oh make sure that you seal the
hole underneath too okay clean the hole
underneath and then uh uh seal it okay
before you put the tole in
place change the
tiles so this is the thing and then this
one you just uh dispose with this tile
and that's it remember they they don't
make this tile anymore okay guys it's
called lifestyle see
it
lifestyle and here's another tile that
slipped down and you're going to have to
do the same thing pull it
out see the water has been running here
for a long time so I don't know if it
cause any damage you you you can see
where the um where the water made the
mark the same thing take your
[Music]
uh your little wire brush and then uh
wash it and then brush it and brush on
the
[Music]
channel and you don't have to use no
Nails okay this is how you do it anybody
who tells you that he's going to use
Nails on the on the field tile that he's
going to replace him he's lying to you
he doesn't use nails so this is my nail
the silicone is going to seal the
one okay I can I found it then make sure
that you remove the nail underneath
okay check your old Nails you see this
one is
Rusted it's been here for the last 30
years
probably and put a your nail
put a brand new
um
galvaniz 16 D
nail just place it on the same same spot
and then nail it
down okay so before you power wash your
house you do all this okay don't just go
up there and then
start see you can tell when the
[Music]
huh remember your little wire
brush and your
silicon so now we use difference before
they didn't seal the exposed Nails I
don't know they had a reason
probably but today we do seal them
and whatever you see some
gaps you do the same thing on the
concrete that's why you you have to use
a actually tomorrow I'm going to use
a I'm going to put some more motor here
on
top so I'm just going to put some uh
silicone
[Music]
to just to because tomorrow I'm going to
power wash after I get I'm done with the
power wash I'm going to uh going to seal
them I'm going to put some on motor and
then I'm going to paint it red so I'll
take another video the rich is kind of
crooked but who cares okay as long as it
doesn't leak also make sure before you
uh do your power wash check the pipes
okay you see like this
one
the the ceiling it's gone so make sure
you remove the old one and apply new
silicon
okay okay make sure that
you seal
your your
pipes use silicon again silicon silicon
don't use mastic because the mastic
doesn't span or contract once it dries
out
and if
the you know since the house is uh built
on you know it's a wood house so Lumber
it
moves so you're
[Music]
not okay make sure you seal it okay
right for
a quick tip uh I don't usually leave the
the bottom part of the tile you
know overlapping the the flashing
because let's see like this piece was
underneath and all this debris it was
trapped underneath it couldn't run down
so I usually leave this
this thing empty so the water runs down
okay it was here so it was dropping all
the trash here on that pipe not usually
when you have trees around your house I
don't recommend you to to tell your
roofer to leave you this little piece I
mean it looks nice but sometimes the
comet look is the is the last thing you
want to you want to put on your roof um
mainly just focus on the long lasting
uh of the roof uh it's going to last the
warranty and uh you're not you're not
going to cause you any problems okay cuz
anyway roofs they look ugly after like
six seven years so don't really pay too
much attention to the to the Cosmetic
thing I mean at some point yes a little
bit when it's brand new but don't get
too picky about your roof okay focus
mainly on the on the last long lasting
uh warranty of your roof okay thank you
guys
