hi welcome today I'm preparing a kids
cheese fono really easy to prepare
instead of alcohol I'm using apple juice
unsweetened apple juice and don't worry
about the ingredients you can find them
at the end of the
segment I'm going to heat the apple
juice to a boil and as soon as that's
ready we'll add the cheese I have some
Canadian
Swiss I'm using some
[Music]
cheddar and the trick here is the
cornstarch that's going to pull it all
together use your hands to toss and
distribute the corn starch
evenly this is ready and you add a
little bit at a time you have to have
some patience
here handful at a time and you stir stir
continuously as it melts you add
more can have your children help you
they can help you shred the cheese they
can help you
stir get them involved so they'll want
to eat the food
after add last little
bit and just keep stirring till it's
silky
smooth this is ready I've just
transferred my cheese to my phon Zoo pot
I'm going to add a little bit of
pepper and if you want you can add a
little bit of chives diced chives if you
wish I'm going to be serving this with
fruit too so I'm opting not to use any
ches let me give this a little
stir looks so good I usually serve this
with some vegetables today I have some
broccoli and whatever fruit and season
you have and always a little bit of
bread let's have a little
taste little piece of green
apple this looks so
good really nice oh
