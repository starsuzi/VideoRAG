hi my name is linda from the horse
saddle shop and i'm going to clean the
saddle for you
here's the products that i use
to before you start cleaning your saddle
you want to have on hand
and it's the easiest stuff i find with
does a good job without a lot of work i
use leather new
and i spray that on
the leather and then i have three
different size brushes this one is to
get a good lather
it's just a really soft head um on a
brush and these are all like um auto
detail brushes good about the auto shops
or online
and this you could use a toothbrush
instead of this but it gets in the
crevices around the canal and around the
conchos
in the smaller areas this is for your
tooling this has a point in the middle
and it gets down in there in the
nitty-gritty of without hurting your
saddle i use a wash rag to wipe off the
excess
leathernew and also it helps it just
give a good shine and gets it down in
there that's all i do for a cleaning
then
for the silver
we use hagerty's
works really really well it doesn't hurt
the leather at all and it doesn't make
it white it'll be maybe a pink film but
it comes off when you oil it while
you're on leather and i just used an old
wash rag or an old sock or towels cut up
you don't need a lot but it just takes
off that excess
spray and plus the dirt that comes out
of the silver
then in the final
stage of cleaning which helps protect
your saddle and gives it that final
shine we use lexal
it's non-darkening it doesn't make your
light oil
light or rusted leathers dark or
anything it just soaks in
and keeps it nice and pliable and soft
we also use fleece i spray it on the
fleece to put it on the leather so that
you don't get overkill you don't want to
waste it
if you don't have fleece
maybe a sponge
or something of that sort that would
just
make it a nice smooth coat on your final
saddle cleaning
when you start cleaning the saddle
you'll want to start like with the
jockey area here and do up in here and
then i go to the back of the skirt and
underneath the fenders and then we'll do
the fenders and then the candle and the
pommel
what you want to do is you want to get a
good lather
in a small section
and i use a finer brush to do that
and then you want to wipe some of that
off
i use then a different brush
to do the crescents
and with a lot of tooling i use even a
finer harder harsher brush
and then you wipe off any excess
okay next we'll want to do the fender we
need to take it apart so you take your
house strap off
and slide the beveling buckle all the
way up
and then you at this point in time you
want to check and make sure that the
leathers are at least not worn there's
no hard warm spots
clean off up in here
if it's really dirty you want to clean
up with leather new
and just kind of inspect it while you're
doing that
and then after you've cleaned your whole
saddle you want to give it a good shot
with your lex oil
needs foot oil and i
use old
fleece and give it a good shot after
you've cleaned the area
you want to make sure your area is clean
and
then that also protects your leather and
keeps it soft and looking good
okay
when you have rough out on your barrel
saddles or your
cutting saddles
any some trail saddle like have them you
do not want to spray on the rough up
that will darken for sure so what you
want to do is you want to flip it up
and go up under here
this is what would be on a normal saddle
on the outside so this is what you want
to oil to keep your leather clean and
pliable
um
so we'll take this one apart
if you do want to clean your rough out
again use your little soft brush
and just kind of fluff it up
obviously this one doesn't have much
worm on it um staining like this will be
really hard to get out because you don't
want to rub your rough out because
that'll take the raw or the hide off
and make a worse
mark
so you just kind of clean that up like
that
and then you want to spray
this part
now this is darkening
but when it dries out it's going to look
beautiful
be careful not to over spray on your
other rope out
because you just defeated the purpose of
what you're doing here
[Music]
and again wipe off your excess excess
and let that dry
and it'll be
a nice golden look
run your seats
that have the suede you want to use the
same brush
and just go up in here
make sure to take time to get into the
stitching
because that's where the dust settles
and it just adds that final touch over
and clean her up
i'm linda fish from horse saddle shop
and that's how you clean us out
oh no thank you sticky
