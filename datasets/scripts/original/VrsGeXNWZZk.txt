hi
i'm elise from sicksisterstuff.com and
today we're making thanksgiving turkey
cupcakes
for thanksgiving we usually have pie for
dessert but i've got picky eaters
and i myself am not a huge pie person
don't tell anybody but
so we're making an optional dessert that
your kids will love on thanksgiving so
to start out
i just have a basic chocolate cupcake i
took a shortcut and used cake mix but if
you wanted if you had a homemade version
you could use that
and i'm just topping it with chocolate
frosting
also if you have a favorite chocolate
frosting you could definitely
replace this and we have some on our
blog so if you go to sick sister
stuff under the recipe index you'll be
able to find
frostings and so after it's frosted i'm
dipping it in chocolate sprinkles
just enough to coat the frosting
and i found these eyeballs they're
wilton brand and you can find them at
target or walmart
and i'm just placing these on
where the turkey's eyes would go
and this is something fun that your kids
could do
while they're while you're doing dishes
on thanksgiving or something
and then just a candy corn for the beak
and then i place about four or five
candy corns
as turkey feathers along the back
and it's optional if you want to use
red frosting for this next part you
could be finished like this or if you
want to i'm adding just a little
bit of red frosting to finish it off and
really make it look like a turkey
oh not my best but you can find this
recipe
and other delicious thanksgiving recipes
on our blog sicksisterstuff.com
and we will see you there thanks for
watching
do
you
