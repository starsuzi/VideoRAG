hello my name is Ashley today I'm going
to make you Middle Eastern taboule if
you do as I say the result will be
perfect what we need is three bunch of
parsley four cucumbers half a bunch of
mint four to five
tomatoes one
onion and one red onion because I don't
have green
onions one red pepper and one green
pepper and one lemon
half a cup of olive oil or you can use
mazola or
um canola oil and we need half a cup of
balgar salt and pepper and it's optional
if you like to put pomegranate in it
which is the best it gives the best
taste the burger you always have to soak
in a water before you start anything so
it will swell like this we don't need
more than this and that's all you follow
the direction and everything will be
perfect now we're going to start to chop
them the reason that I'm not peeling the
Cucumbers they are fresh from my
garden most vegetables they are from my
garden and you see them I'm chopping
everything very very small
pieces they're very tasty
delicious you take the stems out all you
need the leaves of the mint all the
vegetables that we are doing this tabul
it has a lot of antioxidant it's very
very healthy
[Music]
for we got the stems
out
squeeze the
lemon all right now uh we have to mix
the taboule if you like you can use big
spoon or you can
put uh disposable gloves I want to tell
you one thing this taboule can stay in
your refrigerator for a whole week if
you don't put any seasoning on it no
lemon no Z no olive oil no balgar no
nothing so what it is is what you do is
you mix all
together and this is the seasoning which
is the
lemon and here is about a half a cup of
olive
oil like I said you can use masola you
can use canola oil here's the salt and
pepper
now it's important the lemon the oil and
bugar stay separate from vegetable
because if you mix it will be spoiled in
a day or two so whenever it's ready to
serve you can mix them together as much
as you want and that's how you serve it
with a little taboule vegetables like
this you put put a little bit of the
seasonings the liquid and you put some
of the bugar the bugar always you
can prepare it last minute we don't need
too
much
there and you mix together and this is
the best
taboule now that we are finished
preparing the taboule it's optional to
put
pomegranate in my opinion this is the
best part of the taboule you mix
it and you will enjoy it B appe petitte
and have
fun
