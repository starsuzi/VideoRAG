hey guys I made a tutorial on how to
make uh pillowcase dresses this weekend
because I had a couple to do for a
friend and um here are the things that
you're going to need just your material
ribbon thread scissors take measure and
I put pens in the picture even though I
don't use pens but most people do I was
making one for a 2-year-old and one for
a 4-year-old so my small one is 16 in
wide by 14 in long and my large one is
20 in wide by 18 in Long the band for
the small one is 3 in and the band for
the big one is 4 in I started by surging
my edges now I use a serger if you don't
have a serger you could zigzag the edges
or you could cut it with pink and shears
whatever you want to do to finish out
your edges but this is just what I
prefer you'll go down the sides of um
the D the bodice part of the dress
you will also go down the sides of the
band that's going to go around the
bottom going back down the other side
now I've gotten um to where I can do
these dresses really really quick I can
turn one out in under 30 minutes it's a
real simple easy um little dress to make
and you can just make it any number of
ways with different ribbons different
bows Rick R trim just there's just a a
gazillion different ways we're going to
put the right sides together of the
band your um length and and size of your
dress is going to depend on how tall the
little girl is or or you know whoever
you're making it for these are just
measurements that I've come up with and
you'll just need to measure the child
that you're making it for and there may
possibly be a pattern out there I never
use a pattern for it I just cut my own
we'll sew down both sides of that
band now on the bodice part we're going
to measure down 4 in because this is for
the little um one for the little
2-year-old we're going to start sewing
right there because that opening is
going to be the um like the armhole
sleeve whatever you want to call it so
we're going to start 4 in down onto it
and then just sew down the rest of the
way again on the other side we'll
measure down 4
in
next we're going to press this seam open
you'll also press down little sides of
it that you haven't sewn yet that's
going to make the arm um hole you'll
press that down just so that it's easier
to to stitch it
down and that's what it looks like once
it's pressed we're going to take and
start on one side of it Stitch
down you'll Stitch all the way down the
side you'll go down to where it's sewn
together you're stop making sure you
leave your needle in the the fabric so
that you don't mess up your corner
you'll sew across the
scam again stop with your
needle that's
it that made your little
armhole going to that's what it looks
fish now we're going to move back over
to the serger and we're going to Surge
the top
Edge both pieces of the top
Edge and again you can you can zigzag
this if you don't have a serger or you
can just turn it under twice to finish
it out if you want
to
I'm going to flip it and surge out that
bottom
hem just run around that right
quick
this is a really really cute little
dress to be so
easy I think it got its name from back
in the day when women used to actually
use a pillowcase to make a little dress
out
of okay once we get around the bottom
we're going to take that band and we're
going to open those side seams up make
sure they match up and then we're going
to Surge around the whole
band so that when you sew it onto your
dress everything's finished out you
don't have to worry about any of
that
and that's it you have your band and
your little bodice part we're going to
turn the band upside
down and sew it to the bottom edge of a
little bodice part I usually slip mine
down like this you're going to want to
make sure your side seams are matching
up Stitch those to
together again making sure your side
scenes are still matching
up
once that's finished we're going to
take first and cut all the strings off
my homemade teacher in high school said
not everybody's going to learn how to
sew but everybody can cut strings and
I've lived with that my entire life I
hate strings because to me it's just so
messy she taught us never to leave those
strings we're going to clip this string
this um thread tail we're just going to
fold it
under and we're going to turn down about
an inch of fabric this is going to make
the casing for the ribbon to go through
around the top of the
dress normally I wouldn't do all this
measuring with the tape measure I was
just trying to show for the video what
what you would want to
do we're just going to do about an
inch
tuck that thread Tail
in
and then repeat it on the other side of
the
top and that's it that's all the sew in
there
is here's what it's going to look like
all
finished go and get all your seams all
pressed
down
that's the top
Edge you have those two little casings
for your
ribbon and then there's what the bottom
looks like you're done with the sewing
part you can take and cut ribbon this
again just depends on how big the child
is you're sewing for um I this is for
the little 2-year-old and I cut it 34 in
it probably could have stood to be a
little bit longer just it's going to
depend on how big a bow you can tie and
you don't have to tie a bow you can tie
a knot but um I like
to cut the edges and just kind of clean
them up but um it's totally up to you
how much ribbon you cut it'll just make
a a a prettier bow not a prettier but
just a bow with longer
U legs hanging off of it you'll take a
diaper pin safety pen whatever and
[Music]
um put it on this ribbon so that we can
feed it through this
[Music]
casing then you'll just work that ribbon
through the
[Music]
casing
and that's it you'll just want to Center
up your little dress on your Ribbon to
make sure you have the same amount on
both sides and that is it your dress is
done very very simple like I said I can
make one of these in about 30 minutes um
it it's it's really easy and so cute
when it's done it can be worn in the
winter time with a turtleneck and tights
or in the summer time with nothing and
I've made lots and lots of different
variations of this little dress and uh
to me they're all really cute and there
are so many different versions that you
could do it's cute to match you know
when you have two girls you can make
them look alike but not matchy
matchy but
anyway I wanted to do this so that if
you wanted to make a pillowcase dress
you can give it a try and see how easy
it is and make one yourself thanks guys
