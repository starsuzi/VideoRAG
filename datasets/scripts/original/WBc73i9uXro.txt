hello fashion seers in this tutorial I'm
going to be showing you how to line a
sleeveless dress I'm Colleen jie and
this is fashion sewing Blog
TV here we have the lining of the dress
and the dress itself think of it as a
duplicate copy of the dress is exactly
the
same only the only difference is that
there is a zip in the center back of
this dress now we need the dress on the
right side and the lining is going to be
on the wrong side and then going to open
up the dress at the shoulders cuz it's
not sewn at the shoulders and then I'm
going to slide the dress or funnel it
into the
lining so there we have it the
dress is almost there so we now have
right side of the lining matching the
right side of the
dress and now focused on the upper
section of the dress this is where the
connection is going to happen where the
lining will be actually sewn to the
actual part of the dress here I'm at the
armole and I'm going to start sewing
from the shoulder to the side seam stop
there and then I'm going to do exactly
the same on the other side start from
the shoulder and so to the side seam so
I'm going to pin all that into place
and then so and then I'm going to do the
same for the neckline so you're starting
at the
shoulder
pin and then pin all the way to the
center of the dress and that is
where you will actually sew and stop so
just put another pin there so I'll
actually start from the shoulder and sew
all the way to the center front and then
do exactly the same on the the opposite
side I'm now going to be sewing
the neckline I remember I'm starting
from the shoulder and I'm going to come
all the way to the center front of the
dress and then once I've done that I
repeat the same process on the other
side and then on the armhole I'm going
to start from the shoulder and sew all
the way to the side
seam
so
there
back stitch I pull my pins out as I
[Applause]
go remember you just need to just get to
the center Front I've done the other
side just to save some
time yep and there back
tack add machine cut my Thro rad and
then I'm going to sew
the I'll just turn that
over you just you just going to be doing
it the same to all sides of
the armhole and the
neckline cuz this is where the actual
dress will
connect and um you'll see a nice
clean professional finish once you've
done so remember I'm going to stop at
the side
seam so it's meeting the other Stitch
seam I've
done there we've done
it I just have to and pick that little
bit there and
flatten that
out
that it happens sometimes when you're
just using pins and then I'll just
restitch
that what I'm showing you here is the
har armal and I've trimmed and graded
and clipped into the curved seam just to
relax that and then I'm going to do the
same on the
neckline trimmed and grayed my seams
along the armal and the neckline then
next thing to do as you can see I'm
working on the wrong side of the lining
and I now need to put the lining inside
of the dress so going to the bottom end
I'm going to reveal the
dress pull it through right so so you've
got the right side of the dress and the
right side of the lining and then I'm
going to put the lining inside of the
dress so I'm going to pull
out the
shoulders and all
points this is where this is where it
can get a little bit
tricky and then I'm going to put the
lining into the
dress there we
go so we're starting to have a line
dress here
if I put it like that you can
see that the lining is now inside of the
dress now all I need to do is press my
armal and my neckline and I'll show you
the next stage in where we need to
connect the
shoulders once you've pressed your
armold and your neckline the next
connection point you need to make is the
shoulders so you you can work on on the
right side of your Fashion Fabric or the
lining it doesn't really matter I'm
going to put my hand in between the
dress Fabric and the lining and I'm
going to come up fun on my hand through
the shoulder there we go and I'm going
to grab the back of the no what I'm
going to do first is create a little
tuck in there in order for me to be able
to grab
the back and then pull it
through the hemline of the dress so I'm
actually making sure that I'm lining up
the seams of the neck lined and the
armhole so I'll just put a pin in there
to make
sure that I've done that and cuz you
don't want it to twist
remember and I put another pin
in
there and then what will happen is you
pin all the way around I just show in a
minute and then you'll actually
sew so once you've actually matched up
your shoulder you should have this
little funnel here and I'm going to
start sewing from this point make sure
all your seams and your notches and
matched up and
open
and you're going to sew all the way
around meeting at the same point in
which you
started keep just turn your with as you
go make sure
your seams are open I don't sew over my
pins and I wouldn't recommend you do
either oh that one's coming out by
itself for that any help from me there
we go
mying
it all the way around turn my
work going remove my
pins adj just that a little
bit I turn it
around I'm on the last leg now as they
say right so I'm coming back to the
point where I actually
started
and this tap
there and cut my
threads so there we have
it this is what your work should look
like once you've sewn your lining to
your dress you're going to find there's
some bulk here and that's because the
lining and the uh dress itself is all
bunched up inside and you have the lower
part of the dress where where it's two
separate so you got the dress here and
the lining here and it's connecting
remember at the armor and the neckline
so the magic happens when you put your
hand inside of the dress So the right
side you get the top pull it over the
lining
and there we go let's see if I can just
put this out like
this and obviously that's going to need
some
pressing um you're going to connect the
lining to the zipper tape um once the
lining is actually in and there we
go nice
armo nck lines are joined the
lining on the inside of the
dress looks all beautiful so all the
rawed all the raw edges of the seams are
all hidden inside of the
Garment I hope you found that video
tutorial helpful it may seem a little
bit difficult putting a lining into
sleeve this dress you just need to
remember to focus on the shoulder area
and getting that right and your lining
to your dress will turn out okay if you
have any questions or comments that you
wish to make please put me in the
comment box below and I'll see you in my
next video
