here at westwood gardens we grow over 10
000 poinsettias every year right here in
northwest arkansas
in this video we're going to talk about
how to pick one of those ten thousand
points that is
and how to care for it once you get at
home westwood ground poinsettias are
special because we grow them right here
in northwest arkansas
and they come straight to you fresh from
the greenhouse
one of the unique things that we do is
we actually grow what they call a
straight up
poinsettia which means that the the
plant itself hasn't been pinched
so what you're going to get is a plant
with some nice
big full racks on top
we also will do cell pinch as well which
is what you see a lot of
but with pinched poinsettias you have a
lot of smaller
bracks still gives you nice color
but but not quite as as full as they
straight up
another thing to help you make your
selection with all of these
options um no matter what color you end
up
choosing you really want to look for a
lot of people will say that these
are the blooms but this is actually just
a colored leaf
this is called a great so when you pick
up one zetta
this center part here is actually the
balloon so
the tighter that is the younger i guess
your plant is and the longer it may last
for you
so when you're when you're going to pick
a poinsettia um
just make sure these are are nice and
tight and not fully fluffed out
so how do you keep your poinsettia
looking beautiful
all through the holiday season here are
some tips
on how to do that so the first thing to
consider is location
when poinsettias do best in highlights
but once they're fully colored up
like this one you can pretty much put it
anywhere in your house it's just going
to last longer if you have any higher
light
with placement uh is you really want to
keep them out of
giraffes if there's a cold drafty uh
door or something you really don't want
to place it anywhere
near any of that um or a heater vent
you want to keep the poinsettias away
from heater vents because that might
dry them out that much faster so let's
talk about water
um at first when you get your points at
a home
you'll probably want to check it for
water every day
and by what i mean by checking is just
stick your finger in the soil
to make sure that the soil is nice and
moist
even down underneath the top layer if
you feel on the soil
and it's moist you might skip a day
and check it the next day if you stick
your finger in the soil and it's dry
go ahead and give it a drink and
basically the best way to do that
is to a lot of people will go ahead and
have these pretty
foil wraps for the poinsettia which is
fine but a lot of times these can hold
water um and you don't want your
poinsettia to stand in water
so the best thing to do is to grab one
of these saucers
you can actually stick it into your gold
hot cover
to cover it up but once you've watered
wait about 15 to 20 minutes
pull your saucer off dump it out and
then you can
replace it and you're good to go until
the next day
when senators don't like to stand in
water you can rot out their root system
pretty easily
if you're not sure if you've been
watering too much
or not enough another way to tell is if
you get some dry
yellow crunchy leaves um and your
poinsettia droops a little bit
you're not probably giving it enough
water it's wilty it's too dry
um if you're over watering it you're
going to end up
losing a lot of your leaves they won't
necessarily turn yellow
but they'll fall off and you'll
basically have a stem
with just your red bract on top and no
leaves
so be aware of that and just kind of
keep an eye on how much you water
when it comes to the end of the holiday
season and you're not sure what to do
with your poinsettia
um you can treat it as a decoration like
all of your other decorations
we grow ten thousand every year with a
lot of new varieties each year you can
come back
and get new point settings every year
christmas just isn't complete without a
poinsettia
so come by and pick out yours today
