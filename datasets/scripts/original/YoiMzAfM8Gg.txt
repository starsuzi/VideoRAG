okay
that's my tea
I wanted to share how to make some tea
so
um
I wanted it it's really easy this is my
sun tea that I make and I brought some
teas out so that you can have an example
how to make a really good sun tea
which I like making I usually make the
hibiscus tea in the summer and that's
the jicama and then I add a stick of
cinnamon and it's delicious yeah I have
to get some more and then I have some
other teas that I brought out which are
um
some Sage this is Colleen Sage
this is a really good tea
um
that's a masala chai
and then I have some ginger
and then I have
some black tea that I found that was on
sale and I put it in
a jar that might be a quart and then I
just put three bags
and I just let it sit out in the sun all
day
it makes the most delicious tea I like
it better than boiling it and of course
in the wintertime I do boil the tea and
then I steep it but this is a nice way
of steeping your tea just add some some
purified water or your favorite water
alkaline water or whatever you like and
then our tap water even depending on
your tap water hopefully your tap water
is good so basically
we make this tea and
and you just sit it out in the sun and
that's what I do all day sometimes I
have like three or four I recycle my
jars and I have like three or four
um different teas and that way when I
have gas I said what would you like
would you like some hibiscus tea would
you like some black tea would you like
some chai tea or would you like some
cooling Sage which is really good so
there's a lot of teas out there that are
really delicious so anyways
um
I enjoy having tea did you know that tea
is a mold this is kind of considered a
mold but so be careful when you get your
teas I like to get them where they're
certified organic as you see here I
don't know if you can see that
so yeah
and then you know non-GMO of course
the more organic the better
so get my tees make sure you get them at
a really reputable place and um and
enjoy okay I'll see you soon okay bye
