resin and add some colorful

confetti mix it well and this is going
to be a nice base for the

I have some plastic
mold and pour into a te
layer I would recommend to use a
silicone mold those are so much easier
to work
with I don't like to waste any resin so
I always keep some extra mold next to me

of WS until I have
resin
I will heat up with a heat gun just pop
out all the bubbles and uh let it cure
for a couple of
hours I have some iridis and tissue
paper or decoration

crystals or
metal and all is cover with a thin layer
