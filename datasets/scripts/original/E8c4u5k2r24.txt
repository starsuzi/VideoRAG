we think the best way to tell you about
roommates on stain remover it's just to
show you so here's some red wine on a
white cotton shirt directly on there and
we'll just dab a little stain remover
right onto the shirt let it sit there
you can see it's already starting to
work and we haven't even touched it yet
look at the difference it makes and then
you agitate it rub it in and check out
the results look we haven't even watched
the shirt yet it smells good your hands
aren't irritated you're sure it'll be
fun till you're ready to wash it and you
won't have any more red wine on it
