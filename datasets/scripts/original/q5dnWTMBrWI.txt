thank you for joining us for another one
of sephora's quick tips today we got a
call from a lady who was throwing a baby
shower and she said i need to color my
chocolate fountain pink my daughter is
having a little girl and i want a pink
chocolate fountain
sometimes we'll get ladies who will call
up and they'll say i need a blue
chocolate fountain because
the expectant mother is having a little
boy and so
what we're going to do is we're going to
go through some of the steps that i
would
to prepare your chocolate fountain to
have color added to it and just so that
everything is perfect
the first thing is you need to use white
chocolate
sometimes we'll get questions of can i
use dark or milk chocolate and frankly
you can't you have to color white
chocolate
the colors that cepher offers in an
oil-based food coloring are the color
spectrum we've got red orange yellow
green blue violet and pink
the colors themselves
first off you cannot use a water based
coloring water and chocolate don't mix
if you add a water-based coloring to the
chocolate it will cause it to seize
when you receive your oil-based food
coloring there's oil and there's also
ingredients that make up the color so
it's important to shake the bottle
pretty well it mixes rather quickly
the other thing is i always try and
remove as many variables that might
cause the fountain to not work as
possible and what i mean in saying that
is i will get calls from ladies and
they'll say i decided to melt my
chocolate in a double boiler
and then i added the color in there as
well well
let's get the chocolate fountain running
first
and then add the coloring in
if you melted it in a double boiler a
double boiler insinuates that the water
is boiling water boils at 212 degrees
fahrenheit and
chocolate will scorch
above 132 degrees so if you decide to
have a double boiler to melt your
chocolate i recommend following the
instructions on the back of the bag
they're microwavable safe bags they're
bpa free
we have another video that you can watch
that specifically goes through and talks
about how to melt white chocolate but it
is a little bit more temperamental
because of the high dairy content so
have a look at the other video for the
time being
i melted it in the microwave i poured it
in the fountain and my fountain is
running so i know my chocolate is
perfect it's the right temperature i
know that the my fountain has
the minimum amount of chocolate in it to
make it flow and so now
i'm going to go ahead and add my pink
oil-based food coloring to this
and the auger that's spinning in here is
going to mix the food coloring for me so
really i have very little to do at this
point once i and i can color it even to
the shade that i'm looking for so
let's go ahead and pour this in
and see how it turns out i love this
part it's really actually pretty
exciting
as i add my pink oil-based food coloring
to the crown of the chocolate fountain
i'm only dripping it in and the reason
for that is i'm looking for a specific
color and so i only go slowly to ensure
that the oil-based food coloring can mix
in with the chocolate and i end up
getting the exact color that i'm hoping
for
once i've gotten the chocolate to be the
color that i'd like it to be
there's white chocolate that's sitting
in the bowl i take a spatula i'll push
that white chocolate into
the pink curtain that's flowing down
when i do that that chocolate will then
mix in with the pink chocolate and my
fountain will be a bright
and beautiful pink
i would invite you to give us a call the
next time you consider coloring your
chocolate fountain any of these colors
we have an email that we can send out
that'll actually give you the ratio of
oil-based food coloring to pounds of
chocolate although the pink required
very little food coloring to get it a
bright pink
the red requires considerably more and
each of the colors have
their own unique ratio of
coloring to chocolate that's required so
give us a call we'll shoot you a quick
email and as always thank you for
watching another one of our quick tips
you
