okay I'm making a quick uh uh a fabric
softener I've seen this all over the
internet that you can make your own
fabric softener and I like to make
things I like to try things and see how
they work um so here I have three you
take a gallon jug any kind of gallon jug
or even a leftover fabric softener jug
um 3 cups of water so in here no six
cups of water I'm sorry six cups of
water and then you need white vinegar um
not apple cider vinegar but white
vinegar and here I have two cups of
white vinegar and I'm going to start
adding it to
my six cups of water so here's two
cups I'm going to add six cups of
vinegar I think this vinegar cost
me $268
so and this is this is two this is four
cups
four and two more so it looks like I'll
get a couple at
least over two batches of fabric
softener with this one gallon of white
vinegar so this is my six cups right
here I'm going to
add I almost have I probably almost have
I'll have a gallon of fabric
softener and
then this makes sense for fabric
softener it it is
slimy
um and this is kind of you know silky
feeling too so you get your cheapest um
just whatever fragrance you want are a
nonf fragrance of um Fab of uh hair
conditioner
so it calls for two cups so I'm going to
add almost this whole thing this is a
little bit over two
cups so I'll have enough for another
half maybe a half a
batch and I'm just adding
this to
my that's about
it and it smells good too oh yeah smells
like BC softener and conditioner
and just shake it
up
and use a couple tablespoons to uh A4 of
a cup I'll have the instructions uh
actually on on the bottom in the video
um so just go down below here and look
and see what the instructions are it'll
give the ingredients that's it fabric
softener you almost have a gallon for
very little money so that's it thank
