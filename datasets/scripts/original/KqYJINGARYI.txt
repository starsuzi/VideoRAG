hi guys I hope you're well so this week
I'm actually doing two recipes wooo so
normally I do one a week but because
it's Thanksgiving in about a week's time
I thought I'd show you how to make these
adorable turkey cupcakes which will make
an amazing centerpiece for your table or
even little place settings it's going to
look so
cute now a little cheat if you're
shorten time just go and buy some
chocolate cupcakes no one will judge or
you could even use like the box mix and
just whip those up really really
quickly spoon some chocolate buttercream
frosting over the top of each cupcake
quite a large amount I'll put the recipe
in the description box for
you using an ice cream wafer biscuit or
a thin wafer like this we're going to
use this for the
tail in a plastic Ziploc bag I'm now
going to put in melted chocolate and
then I'm going to cut the corner off
just a tiny bit and this means that we
can pipe onto the wafer biscuits a
pretty
tail so just like a
[Music]
fan pop the wafer biscuits into the
fridge and this is going to help help
set now we can make the head so this is
a soft caramel that I'm shaping into a
head to a round
bow using a candy corn I'm going to cut
off the tip and use that as the
beak using a Twizzler or some red
licorice I'm going to cut this and this
is going to be the red turkey gobbly bit
I think it's called a wle
[Music]
so we're going to bend that in half and
stick all these bits on I'm using Mazy
pound for the eyes cuz that's what I had
but you could use little white chocolate
chips if you wanted and you can actually
buy eyes already made from the cake
decorating
shop now let's stick everything together
beaks on wles on eyes
on I'm using some black food coloring
just to fill in the little eye bits
there give him some pupils
we're using Pokey sticks for the neck
they're just chocolate covered thin
biscuits carefully stick the head
on Goble Goble
Goble we can now assemble so stick your
wafer tail into the back of the
[Music]
cupcake stick the T turkey head on and
neck I'm using two pecans for the
wings and the Candy Corn I'm just going
to cut off the yellow part and use that
as its
feet now I have some flaked almonds and
these make the most gorgeous
[Music]
