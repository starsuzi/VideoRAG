Hi, everyone. I'm Noreen and welcome back to my kitchen today. We have a special treat for you today
We are going to make our very own
No cook instant vanilla and chocolate pudding mixes these are super easy to make so let's go see how these all come together
Okay, we're going to go over all the ingredients today. We are going to be making homemade
instant no-cook
Chocolate and vanilla pudding mix now
I know it's easy to go to the grocery store and buy pudding mix I do it a lot
I use alive a lot of recipes that require a pudding mix
But you know what there are some ingredients in those pudding mixes that people just simply don't want to eat
Thought of chemicals and preservatives and additives an artificial flavor an artificial color you can make your own
Very simply, but you are going to have to have a specialty ingredient
And you've heard me talk about it before and it's instant clear gel very important
That is the instant kind because the instant kind works
With the no cook method now
This is the kind of pudding mix
Just like you buy from the store that you're going to have to add milk to you can use whatever kind of milk
You can use cow's milk. Goat's milk
cashew Milk Almond Milk
coconut milk soy Milk Rice milk
Whatever is your personal choice, and you're going to be able to have a nice creamy pudding consistency
You'll also be able to use this pudding mix to add to recipes. I will give you the
the amount because at the end of the day a half a cup equals a box of pudding and
No more, so you may have seen recipes like that this out on the internet that require cooking
Instant doesn't mean you should cook it
And so we're going to go ahead and make one that requires zero
cooking you're going to be able to make this just like the grocery store kind by mixing it up sitting it in your fridge and
moving on
So super simple the vanilla requires just a few ingredients and so does the chocolate
you're going to need instant clear Gel which is
Easily Accessible, I will put a link down below where you can purchase the very same brand that I use. Which is Carnaby's
Ultra Gel and is Gmo free it is instant
and it is really really good so two cups of instant clear gel two cups of
Granulated sugar and down here. We have a
teaspoon of vanilla Powder a half a teaspoon of Turmeric for color and a half a teaspoon of salt
The chocolate is almost identical except we've got two cups of granulated sugar 2 cups of instant
Clear gel a cup and a half of dutch processed cocoa
And I'll also leave a link to my favorite brand of cocoa which is this from the prepared pantry?
Which is a medium dark Dutch process cocoa
Ric's friends put me on to the prepared pantry cocoa it is the best
I have ever used what we're going to use here for flavoring is a half a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla Powder
We're also going to add in we're going to add vanilla extract when we make it up
We'll mix it with the liquid, but what I'm going to do now is clear bring over the food processor
And we'll go take you through the process of how to make this stuff, okay?
We're going to blend up our vanilla pudding mix first
And then we're going to blend up our chocolate because that makes sense
First thing very important make sure that the container of your food processor is
very very dry you can also do this in a standard Blender and
It will work the same basically you want to make sure everything gets ground up together
And when you live in humidity ville things stick, so there goes our sugar
in our ultra gel instant
Clear gel and here goes our salt vanilla Powder and turmeric
just a little to mark if you want to add a full teaspoon you can it's just going to be a little bit of a
Darker color if you don't want to add it at all you can leave it out
But your pudding isn't going to have that traditional, yellowy
Hue that it does when you buy it in the store, so we're just going to turn sahn and let it rip for fuse
I'd say about a minute
All right
This has blended for plenty of time now
You just want to give it a few seconds to settle because there's going to be
There will be some putting smoke there folks, and you don't want to breed that
if you're a fan of the blendtec videos you'll understand, so
Just give it a moment to settle down and it's going to be a little bit gritty
putting smoke
But you see it almost resembles very closely vanilla pudding mix that you would purchase in the grocery store
And now all you have to do is spoon this into an awaiting jar. So that's what we're going to go ahead and do
The important thing is to let it run long enough so that it gets a nice
cohesive blend
Alright, let's make the chocolate pudding mix we're going to put in our sugar our
Clear gel our cocoa powder
And by volume this one's going to make just a little bit more and our salt and vanilla power
And again, we're going to put the lid on here
And we're going to turn it on and we're going to let it blend for at least a minute
all right, this has blended the requisite amount of time this does seem to be as
Smoky as the vanilla, and I think that's because the cocoa has a little bit of a moisture content to it
So what I'm going to do is just make sure everything is blended up really well
We're going to spoon this into a jar, and I'm going to do that off-camera, and when we come back
We're going to make some pudding so you guys can see what it looks like so we'll be back
And we'll mix some up all right. We're going to go ahead and make up
One batch each of this pudding mix so I have already measured out a half a cup of each mix
You can see that the chocolate mix makes considerably more than the vanilla and that's because of the bulk created by the cocoa
so we're going to go ahead and start with the
Chocolate mix and I have two cups of milk here like I said you can use whatever kind of Dairy or non-dairy
Milk you like and we're just going to get in here with
a whisk
You can already see it starting to get thick
You can go ahead and add another spoonful of your pudding mix I feel like if you just let this hang out for a minute
It's going to get thicker
I'm just going to pop the lid on it and stick that in the fridge, and we'll be right back
Well, we're going to mix up the vanilla too all right
we're going to mix up our vanilla pudding just the same way I've got a half a cup of the vanilla mix and
two cups of milk
oh
Yeah, we need a tablespoon of vanilla extract in here. Just like that
this will also help to impart some additional color and it's not going to look exactly the same as the stuff in the box because
It doesn't have artificial powdered color and also doesn't have artificial powdered flavor. So you know
Okay, we're going to whisk this up the same we're going to put this in the fridge for five minutes
And then we'll be back and we'll show you what it looks like there. You have it delicious
Homemade no cook instant pudding in a matter of moments
This mix is going to be coming in really handy for you, especially with back-to-school coming up now
I do need to tell you I will make sure that the how to make instructions are on the website
I started off with a half a cup of mix and two cups of milk, but in the end
It's one cup of mix and two cups of milk and if you want it thicker from there
then you're going to want to add a little bit more, so
this consistency that we got is absolutely perfect and
I'll show it to you
But don't worry because you're going to be able to get the the instructions on my website
I'll leave a link down below and I'm going to give this a taste
Delicious the chocolate is Super rich and delicious
Because of the cocoa people I'm telling you that is the best doggone cocoa ever the vanilla
And you see how this one looks a little bit on the thicker side if you don't want it that thick then you can add
a little milk
If you get it, too thick or you can just back off on the mix and that is lovely in vanilla ensues
And also I did put a tablespoon of vanilla in the chocolate pudding also
This is awesome, and who doesn't just love a little bowl of pudding
For dessert top with a little whipped cream, it's all good. So that's how you make homemade
No cook instant vanilla and chocolate pudding mixes. I hope that you give this a try
