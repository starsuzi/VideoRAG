Jerris mo how marks right here
today's a solemn occasion this is an
effigy to one my most recent brothers
who were laying to rest today
his name was woody but his friends call
him stumpy he was a true Native American
and one of the last of his species he
was born in the late 8th 1700 or early
1800s and probably had some very special
experiences that we wish we all could
have shared I could only guess all the
truly wonderful experiences he had like
watching the Sun Rise of God beautiful
creatures secure nut underneath him I
just wished he was here and could have
shared those experiences with us woody
you stood tall and proud you were over
150 foot tall and you shouted those
beneath you you stood your ground until
the very end you were a fighter just
like me
what do you may be gone but not
forgotten this winter when it's cold
outside
a part of you always keep me mourn and
for all those who hate
this serious on my video when you call
me dumb as a stump didn't you're
actually giving me a compliment
Cheers
rest in peace woody
gone but not forgotten
you
