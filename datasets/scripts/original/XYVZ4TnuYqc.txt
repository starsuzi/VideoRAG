thank you
[Music]
now that's lounging
hey there my name is Tim and I work here
at spoonflower on the operations team
and today we're going to learn how to
make the coziest pair of pajama pants
you've ever lounged in using the Jasper
pattern from Artemis clothing and Sprout
patterns Sprout patterns is actually one
of spoonflower sister Brands they offer
Indie sewing patterns that you can
combine with spoon flower designs to
create customized cut and sew projects
spoonflower then prints the pattern
directly onto fabric it's quick easy and
painless
since we're using the Jasper pattern for
this tutorial you'll have to purchase it
before we get started alright y'all
let's get lounging
for this project you'll need your Jasper
Pattern Fabric from Sprout
scissors or a rotary blade measuring
tape pins
twill tape
and a sewing machine
[Music]
start by cutting out your pattern pieces
[Music]
your Jasper pattern includes two front
pant legs two back pant legs
two waistband pieces and a fly facing we
want our pants to look and feel
professional so we're going to Edge
finish the seams we're going to zigzag
Stitch but you can use a serger as well
go ahead and Edge finish the side seams
the craft seams and the end seam only
Edge finish the fly on the left pant leg
leave the fly on the right leg alone
on the left front pant leg snip the seam
allowance on the bottom of the fly fold
the fly on the left pant leg over at the
crotch so that the wrong sides are
together and Stitch down a fourth of an
inch seam allowance along the curve of
The Fly
pin and Stitch the fly facing on the
right pant leg using a fourth inch seam
allowance
[Music]
clip along the curve in the seam
allowance of the fly facing up to the
stitching line this allows the seam to
lie flat turn the fly right side out and
press
[Music]
place the front leg and back leg
together so that the right sides are
together
and pin
[Music]
Stitch the inseam and side seams of both
legs together
[Music]
turn one of the pant legs inside out
[Music]
insert the right side out pant leg into
the Inside Out pet leg so the right
sides are together
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
match up the center back waist side seam
inseam and fly and then pin in place
starting from the crotch seam Stitch
from the bottom of the fly all the way
around to the center back waist
[Music]
line up the left and right fly so that
the side with the fly facing the right
side laps behind the left side and the
two sides meet at the center Front
Stitch across the fly one inch above the
bottom of the fly
pivot the fabric 90 degrees and sew down
to the bottom of the crotch this should
resemble a triangle shape
alright let's make the waistband since
we're using twill tape you'll need to
stitch two buttonholes that are a fourth
of an inch taller than the width of your
twill tape to determine the location of
the buttonholes measure three-fourths of
an inch up to the bottom edge of each of
the two notches on the front waistband
pieces these will be the openings where
the drawstring comes out and ties
[Music]
with the right sides together Stitch the
front and back waistband pieces at the
side seams
fold the waistband so that the wrong
sides are together
[Music]
and press
[Music]
now it's time to pin the waistband and
pants right sides together aligning the
lower edges of the waistband with the
top edge of the pants make sure the
buttonholes are facing the front center
of your pants and the raw edges are up
[Music]
Stitch the waistband to the pants
now turn your waistband up
press flat
and top Stitch your seam allowance from
the waistband to your pants
to finish up we'll need to quickly hem
the pants we'll start by folding the
bottom edge of each pen leg a half an
inch and then pressing
then fold the edge over another inch
press so that the raw Edge is concealed
then top Stitch the folded Edge
to make it a bit easier to feed the
Twill tape through the waistband poke a
safety pin through one side of our twill
tape be sure to give yourself enough
twill tape to tie your pants then push
it through one of the buttonholes and
inch your way around the waistband by
pushing and pulling the safety pin
[Music]
and that's it hold them up admire them
and put them on but be careful you might
never take them off again
