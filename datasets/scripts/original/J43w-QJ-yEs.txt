Hi everyone, I'm Sam from SugarSpunRun.com, and today
I'm going to be showing you how to make my favorite cream cheese frosting. This is a recipe
I have been making forever. It is my all-time favorite frosting, and I'm so excited to be sharing it with you today
This recipe only calls for five ingredients: cream cheese, butter
powdered sugar, vanilla extract,
and salt, so let's get started!
For this cream cheese frosting
I am going to be using my electric stand mixer, you guys know I love my KitchenAid,
but you can absolutely use an electric hand mixer instead.
I don't really recommend making this by hand unless you want a really good or workout.
We'll start by combining one stick, or 1/2 cup, of unsalted butter and 8 ounces of cream cheese in the bowl of your stand mixer.
You'll want these to be softened to room temperature
Next add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon of salt
Finally, gradually add your powdered sugar.
This recipe calls for 4 cups of powdered sugar.
Make sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl so that you get all of your powdered sugar well incorporated.
At this point your frosting is really done and ready to go!
Look at how smooth and creamy that is! I'm going to put this in a piping bag and pipe it on some cupcakes,
But this makes enough to spread on a two layer 8 inch or 9 inch cake as well.
Today I'll be piping this cream cheese frosting on my carrot cake cupcakes. 
I'm using an Ateco 848 large tip.
And that is how you make my favorite cream cheese frosting?
I hope you guys loved this really easy recipe, so please, if you try it out
let me know what you think, and I will see you next time!
