hi this is Leslie Beal with the art of
gardening today I'm going to talk about
Hol Hawks and show you at what stage my
Hol Hawks are in in my garden and to
show you how you can grow them
too Holly Hawks are perennials sometimes
bials because you have to keep planting
them from year to year but they will
come back up if you're not familiar with
them they're beautiful flowers on tall
spikes such as the ones I just planted
the other day this is a fairy Morse Hol
Hawk summer carnival mixed
colors here is how the Holly Hawk seed
looks from the
packet I planted these the other day and
this is what a Seedling would look like
and they've come up really
great a couple of weeks
ago maybe
three because it takes about 10 to 14
days to germinate I planted some
burpees here's one at about that
stage getting a little bit bigger
there and now I'm going to show you ones
that I planted last year
keep in mind that when
you plant Hol Hawks you're not going to
get flowers the first year it takes only
10 to 14 days to germinate to make a
plant but they will probably stay about
a plant probably about this size even
though this is last year that's what I
had last year all
along I had about two
rows either some didn't make it or the
mole plowed through here and they just
didn't come up good now as you can
see they're quite tall and this is June
2nd so this is what you what you're
going to get the second
year and if you look along these
plants I do believe I've got some buds
even starting to form such as
this it will start looking like
that you can see that sun's so bright
today there's the buds forming this will
become a huge stalk much like you saw on
that
packet let me step out here a ways and
you can
see that they are starting to get bigger
this is only June 1st they're probably
going to get to about 4 feet maybe
five and they'll have flowers this year
so what you want to do is you want to
constantly each year if you want holiday
Hawks plant more and in the fall you can
collect the
seed which I did and have already
planted some I think they're in
there and what you want to do is is the
bloom it will on the spike the bloom
will be about that big of a seed head
that has from the bloom and all along
there it'll be kind of like a little
turbine looking like a hat and the the
circular seeds will be all along that
one of those probably has oh I don't
know enough to probably plant your next
years the beauty part about it is is
most packets will come in a
mixed you know mixed
colors and so if you want a specific
color white pink maroon then in the fall
make sure you're watching what blooms
those are and when they go to seed you
can put them in a envelope and then mark
them as such and next year you know you
can put the exact color so here's how
they are when they're first
germinating that's about maybe 2 and 1/2
Weeks here's one at
about 3 weeks or
more this is probably one that would
look like how you would get it your
first
year and then next year they'll be
they'll be at that
rate right off the bat early
summer and you'll have
flowers for that
year best rule of thumb is though always
keep some Hol Hawk seed on
hand I always buy a few packets and I
use my seeds from last year in case the
seed wasn't good something happened to
him over winter and or you just need
more of a of maybe you want to try to
get more
colors but have fun planting your Hol
Hawks it's an old country charmer tall
spikes beautiful open flowers bees love
them and I have I'm planting these in
where I'm going to have my pumpkin patch
to help attract bees to help pollinate
the flower so I can have
pumpkins and they kind if you have Rows
of Sharon bushes they almost look like
that or hibiscus only they're a little
more um sometimes they're more cuffed if
they're a double variety just pick the
one you like and
enjoy
