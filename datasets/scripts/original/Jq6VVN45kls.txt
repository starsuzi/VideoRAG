Welcome to the APW Repair Center
Today, we're going to teach you how to properly setup and start your pressure washer
We'll be demonstrating this on a Generac consumer-grade pressure washer, but this should work for most standard pressure washers
The first step is to connect the garden hose and the high pressure hose to the pump
You never want to start a pressure washer without the water running through the pump, so make sure that you have the water turned on after connecting it
If you run it without water, you run the risk of burning up your seals or cracking a piston
Next, you need to provide your engine with gas by flipping the gas release switch to the ON position
Now, you'll want to turn the throttle up to rabbit speed and not turtle speed
sliding the switch away from you is how you turn the throttle up on most models
After that, you'll want to prime your washer by flipping the choke switch to the ON position for the initial start
Now, before starting the engine, you'll want to purge your pump and hoses of all air
by holding the trigger down on the gun until all the air is expelled and only water runs out of it
After all the air is expelled, flip the red switch to the ON position, then give the recoil a pull
If it doesn't start on the first try, don't be discouraged. Sometimes it takes two or three
After you have your washer started, flip the choke switch back to the OFF position in order to get your engine idling properly
Now, with your washer running, the real fun begins!
So get out there and enjoy some clean times
