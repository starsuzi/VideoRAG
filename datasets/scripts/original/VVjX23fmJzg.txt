you probably already know that as a cat
owner but if you're a newb I hope this
helps you I'm going to be demonstrating
today how to properly and very easily
and quickly clean a litter box you
should do this at least once a day but I
like doing it twice a day I have three
cats and three litter box but actually I
should have four litter boxes um
I should have you should have the number
of cats plus one I like these large bins
this is a a Sterilite bin and it's very
cheap very inexpensive it's like five
six bucks but it's very good because
it's very spacious I always like to have
five six Ines of litter in it and I top
it off about once a week or once every 3
four days face and I change the litter
about once a month um there are people
who change the litter every two weeks or
every week and there are people who
don't change it at all sometimes I don't
change it I just clean it much more
often than um twice a day so what you
need to clean your litter box is of
course this
scooper plastic bags I like the uh 4
gallon plastic bag and I just buy a row
of 100 and
non-toxic
um pre moistened
sheets so what you do is this do this
and then you just do
that so everything goes like
so and now you can clean the wall
of the litter box because cat like
everything very very
[Music]
clean if you see your cats going to the
litter box and turning their faces
away you can see that the litter box is
not clean off
so they're actually saying mom mommy or
daddy time CH
clean so this is actually very easy to
do just make sure that the sheets that
you use are
nontoxic so you do this now from the
bottom of the
tray you just start doing
this and then the clumps will fall and
you just get
them like
so it's very very easy being very
quick actually no trouble at
all so this way you don't need to
guess where the clumps
are and you are sure to get
everything so it shouldn't take take
more than a minute to clean a whole box
so you shouldn't have an
[Music]
excuse to clean a box twice a day
[Music]
[Music]
and then when you do
this make sure you want to tap it from
the other
side and you clean also on the other
side
so you have a completely
[Music]
clean and
sanitized
box for your
kitties to is
so after I'm done I just
pack one more
time just to see if there is any little
Clump that I left
behind but that's it very easy when I
distribute the litter back I always make
sure that there is always more on the
sides because my heat is like to pee on
the
edges so there you go doesn't take over
a minute it's clean it's sanitized it's
ready to go and I have three perfectly
happy kitty cats thank you and I hope
this helps you bye-bye
