welcome back once again to how toook gra
food.com if you haven't already please
subscribe to our Channel okay going to
make some fantastic lamb chops today for
the
barbecue in a kind of Middle Eastern
Arabic style so let me just run through
some
ingredients at the back here I've got
some salt this is 1 teaspoon I've got
some cumin powder 1
teaspoon
tumeric 1 teaspoon garlic and ginger
paste 1 teaspoon chili powder 1
teaspoon black lemon powder which is
really the predominant flavor here one
teaspoon got some ground black pepper
there fairly Co one teaspoon white sugar
2 teaspoons I've got a couple of limes
here which I'm going to squeeze on as
well you could use fresh lemon if you
wanted I'm going to add some olive oil
little touch of chopped onion and of
course our lamb shops and I've got here
about as you can see
there I've got about 10 or 12 pieces
there that's enough to do these let's
get on with
that okay so get yourself a nice mixing
bowl got some nice chops in there nice
bit of fat on them still beautiful
really happy with those ones this this
is so simple all we're going to do is go
in with that
salt one
teaspoon that
sugar two or 3 teaspoons up to you black
pepper one
teaspoon black lemon powder 1
teaspoon cumin powder 1
teaspoon turmeric or howy which give me
a nice color as well one
teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon but up
to you use more if you
want that garlic ginger paste which is
50/50 fresh ginger and garlic chopped
up that lime or lemon and throw them in
as well cuz we're going to leave these
for a few
hours so these limes can still work a
little bit of magic for
us lemon's good as well but I think lime
works really nice on this one so in
there you go now some olive
oil not a great deal I mean I'm just
needing enough to kind of moisten these
up and then just a little bit of chopped
onion and I give it a nice Flavor now no
simple way to do this you got to use
your hands make sure they're clean get
them
in and just throw them around so all of
that mixture get gets all
over all of our beautiful lamp now the
next thing we're going to do is we're
going to cover
this put this in our refrigerator you
need to leave this for at least 4 hours
at least I mean I'm going to leave these
overnight they are for my barbecue but
you could do these on a dry Skillet if
you wanted entirely up to your inside
your house so that's it they're going to
look fantastic tomorrow they're going to
taste great they're going to be bursting
with flavors they're going to go on to M
Grill it's that simple see you later
