hey guys welcome back to my channel in
this video I'll be showing you guys how
to make steamed cabbage this is a great
side dish for any curry recipe so for
this we'll use one head of
cabbage and I have some time so I use a
couple spring of thme and half a muggie
cube or chicken buyant
one roma tomato one small onion and I'll
be using 1/4 cup of olive oil so to
start I'll start off by cutting my
cabbage which I already washed prior to
the beginning of the video so you go
ahead and start
cutting I want this into a form of
shredded
cabbage so I just do this and just start
slicing them
up and I'll slice my onions and my
tomatoes and I'll come back and show you
guys the cooking process okay I'll add
1/4 cup of olive oil to My
Pan and I add my chopped onions and I
let that saut√© for about 3 minutes I
have my stove set on medium high
okay it's been about 2 minutes now I'll
go ahead and add my
tomatoes to
it and stir it
around now I add my chicken boyant to
it just crush it in
there stir it around a little
bit and right away you want to add your
cabbage so it can all steam together
just add it

right in the
pot this pot might be too
small for a whole head of cabbage but it
will shrink down quite a bit
[Music]
all
right and I'll put a lid on and let it
Steam for a good 5 minutes I'll come
back and just turn it and just Stir It
make sure it's not burning on the
bottom all right it's been about 4
minutes I'll just go ahead and stir it a
little bit to make sure it's not burning
on the bottom
and I'll add couple spring of
th to
it and cover it again and let it Steam
for another 5 minutes or
so okay now I stir it around even more
to make sure the bottom of my pot is not
burning
just like so now I add about half a
teaspoon of
salt and keep stirring
it and I'll cover this back up and let
it Steam for another 5
minutes okay
and it looks pretty good I don't want my
cabbage to be soggy I like a little
crunch to my steamed
cabbage and to me this looks
perfect that's pretty much it it smells
really good it looks really
