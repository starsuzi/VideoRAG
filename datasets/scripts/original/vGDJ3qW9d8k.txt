everybody I'm Narine and welcome to my
kitchen we've been cooking our Irish
stew and I'm going to make um a starch
to go along with it now we've got all
sorts of veggies and potatoes and
parsnips and turnips and all kinds of
vegetables in that stew but instead of
making noodles or potatoes or rice you
know I got some cute potatoes in there
but we're going to make barley now you
may think that's unusual I love barley
and for those of us who are prepping um
barley is really an amazing grain that
you should consider putting in your food
storage um barley
contains eight different amino acids it
contains all sorts of um
micronutrients and and minerals vitamins
and it has a lot of protein in it and
it's got um It's Got Fabulous properties
that are necessary for human survival
but um in other parts of the world
mostly in northern Europe and in
Scandinavia they eat barley all the time
and barley you know it's more common to
use it as an animal feed but it's really
delicious you know you may be familiar
with beef and barley soup but other than
that have you ever really eatting barley
we're going to cook barley today like
you would cook rice and I'm going to
show you how to do that and Rick's going
to let the cat
out this is pearled
barley and I buy this in
bulk you can find it with sometimes in
grocery stores you can find it alongside
the dry beans in the commissary I find
it in the Latin food section um I also
have I also buy this in number 10 cans
from um Thrive they you get a whole case
six number 10 cans of barley is less
than
$40 um and barley I think is an amazing
thing to have because barley is a cereal
grain barley can be used as a breakfast
cereal it can be used as a supplement to
protein it can be used hot or cold um
and it's really delicious but there is a
trick to cooking barley and that's what
I'm going to teach teach you how to do
now so I store my barley in my mason jar
my big mason
jar and just like I do with my rice I'm
going to measure out two cups of barley
into this fine mesh
SI and we're going to rinse it under
cool running
water Sor working around a speed bump in
here uh
[Music]
and I like to get my hands in
there and just let the water run through
it you want to get all of the you know
there's some dust on there like with any
grain um that's been stored um rice
especially there's a lot of starch on
the outside and rinsing this off now is
going to help you
later now once I get this nice and
rinsed the way I want it
that's prob okay just fine I'm going to
bring my pot over
here you're going to need a very large
pot
Okay
and like
this I'm going turn on my filter
turn and I'm going to
[Music]
put I'm going to fill the
pot about 2/3 of the away with water or
maybe half with
[Music]
water you want to give the barley plenty
of
room now barley is not like rice it is
not going to absorb all of your cooking
liquid you are going to drain it at the
end that's about that's just about
right okay we're going to put this we're
not going to put any salt or anything in
here I'm going to set this on Med on
medium high heat and I'm going to bring
it to a boil as fast as possible and I'm
going to let it boil for 1
minute when that is done we're going to
come back and I'll show you what happens
next
okay we're at a boil and you need to
keep an eye on this because the barley
is very starchy and it will boil over if
you're not careful so if it gets to like
a really big rolling boil it's going to
boil over so you just need to keep an
eye on it so what we're going to do now
is we're going to drain
it and this is nowhere near ready to
eat
so what we're going to
do is we're going to rinse it
with cold
[Music]
water and we're going to get all that
extra starch off of
there like I said this is not ready to
eat at
all still very hard
and just this little side note barley
was really prized by the ancient
Egyptians this is one of their main
sources of of
grain it
does now we're going to cover it with
water
again and there really are no
measurements I
mean because we're not absorbing all of
the liquid we just want it to have
plenty of
[Music]
room to move around in the pot and get
hydrated so I filled that pot up I'd say
by
half and then we're just going to put it
back on the stove and I'm going to put
it on medium heat we're going to boil
this
for about an hour and then when we come
back we'll drain it and it'll be ready
to
serve our barley has been simmering in
the water for about an hour and I
checked it about halfway through and I
added a little more water you don't want
it to boil dry you want it to have more
liquid in it than you think that it
needs because we're going to go ahead
over to the sink now we're going to
drain this and we're going to rinse it
with hot water that reminds me of
oatmeal and it can be eaten very similar
to oatmeal it's much better for you than
oatmeal
actually if you wish I I would highly
recommend that you go ahead and um well
that's that's not going to be big enough
so I need to get a bigger Coller all um
no I I want them to look up the
nutritional value of
barley
and I didn't real realize I didn't rinse
that enough what cooking it
it's what they we cooking it so they
need to practice that's true and you
need to practice I mean it's easy to
throw a handful of barley into your Soup
pot and that's an excellent way of using
it but barley can be used a lot of
different
ways a lot of different
[Music]
ways and the reason I want to rinse
it is because barley will continue to be
very very
starchy told you my mom used to use Sal
all the time yeah I've never done that I
think I'll have to try that but I think
I'm getting ready to um make sauerkraut
we're going to do a video or two on how
to lacto ferment your own sauerkraut
because sauerkraut is nothing more than
cabbage and salt and
thme but you can see how different this
looks now that we have rinsed it I'm
getting all that starchy water out of
there
and I'm going to just return it back to
the
pot and give it a good
Shake there we
go and you can and I did not flavor this
I could have added the extra broth that
I took out of my stew um to The Barley
but I wanted to in case there's
leftovers I want to be able to have it
for breakfast or do whatever I want with
it you know so that it doesn't is not
limited to just a main
course now when you I just want to make
a comment that someday real soon here we
will be replacing this sink with a
stainless steel one oh thank goodness I
hate those white plastic scks mhm but
one thing I want to mention you know
we're going to use this in place of
you're going to use this as our starch
tonight in place of rice or noodles or
you know mashed potatoes or whatever um
but if you chill this you you can use
this like tabuli which is cracked vulgar
wheat um you add in some olive oil some
Tomatoes some chopped vegetables and you
make a nice cold salad you can eat this
cold as a cereal with milk and honey you
can eat it hot as a cereal with cream
and sugar and it would be absolutely
delicious and the health benefits of
barley are vast so go look up some
information about barley learn about
what it contains and how good it is for
your body you know hundreds of years
worth of people can't be wrong the
ancient Egyptians swore by
barley so there you have it that's how
you make barley it's super
easy I mean there's a couple of
processes you have to go through and
maybe that's why we don't do it because
it's a little more detailed than just
rice but so what rinse boil rinse boil
and rinse and you're done I mean it
takes about an hour and a half but
really it really it takes a little bit
longer than rice but you know you know
put it into your schedule and give it a
try eat it with your stew and and I hope
you love it so uh until next time I'll
see you
