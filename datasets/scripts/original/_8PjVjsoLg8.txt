hello YouTube welcome back to our
kitchen today we're going to be cooking
a crispy oven fried chicken stay
[Music]
tuned I have here some chicken thighs
that I have actually removed the skin
and most of the fat here I have some
unseasoned panco bread crumbs I have
three eggs in this bowl um I'm going to
be seasoning my chicken with uh seasoned
all for chicken and you can use any
seasoned all or any kind of U season you
would like on your chicken I'm going to
use peppera white pepper black pepper
and some garlic powder I will also uh be
using a cooking oil spray so let's get
started first thing we're going to do is
um we're going to go ahead on and just
beat our
[Music]
eggs don't really do it like
that also make sure you have your oven
preheated to
400 you're also going to need a baking
dish uh for your chicken preferably one
with a rack I'm going to be using a rack
and the reason we using a rack so that
he can surround the start I'm going to
start with the season
on and just cover each piece then I'm
going to do the
peppera
next I'm going to be using some black
[Music]
pepper and next after that some white
[Music]
pepper and finally
little garlic
[Music]
powder okay after you've um season one
side just go ahead and flip your chicken
over okay and we're going to do the same
thing on the opposite side
Okay so we've mixed the seasoning on our
chicken the next thing we're going to do
is Dredge it but before we dredge it in
the panco breadcrumbs we're going to go
ahead and pour our eggs wash over the
chicken and again we're going to mix
again now this is the process where
we're going to dredge our chicken and
get it ready to go in the oven um what
I'm going to do here is go down and
spray your
rack with some
oil
and we're going to just take our chicken
we're going to dredge it in the Pano
bread
crumb shake off any
excess and just lay it on the
rack again just going to lay it in the
panco bread
crumbs
these are unseasoned so this is how it
goes if you use seasoned panco
breadcrumbs you don't need to put much
seasoning on your chicken probably just
a little garlic powder and a little
black pepper
um but if it's unseasoned then you
definitely want to season your chicken
to your taste we have our um chicken Dr
the pan of breadcrumbs getting ready to
put it in the oven before we do that
going to give a really good
spray make it nice and crisp crispy with
our oil spray and off to the oven it's
going to go um we're going to cook it
for about
55 to an hour and 10 minutes just
depends on your oven okay the chicken is
coming along pretty good about 5 more
minutes looks like okay guys here is our
finished product tasty and crispy
enjoy
