god look oh my God come on
dog holy another one look at that they
all identical they're all identical God
nice
fish this is the trout that I caught at
the lake it's a rainbow trout and today
I am going to show you how to cook it
while rainbow
trout first these are the ingredients I
used I used /4 H teaspoon of salt4
teaspoon of black pepper this is 2
tbspoon vinegar and 2 tbspoon of olive
oil four clove of garlic like you see
there and we just get a
medium onion and we just cut it in round
like that to put them inside when you
finish
so then when I get all my ingredients
here the salt pepper and garlic goes in
this they call it Mor
pester so I cut I put my salt pepper and
garlic inside here and I match it really
good so that's what I get out of that is
it looks moist now because I just put
the two tablespoon
vinegar then now I am going to put the
olive oil here that's all you
need mix it up a little
bit
so we mix this seasoning really good so
it's already ready to go here so I just
leave it there and I'm going to make a
couple cuts here just in an angle like
this make a couple cuts
here okay you better have a better knife
than I have mine is a little doll
here so here take a couple
cats
there we
go
mhm couple more
here on this
side okay don't make one more close to
no that's good so then you get your
seasoning already mxed here and you just
put it here
see put it
inside there we
go I use for Clover garlic but if you
like more garlic you can put some more
so then I put all that all over to just
do
that now turn it do the same thing again
here so do the same thing with your
seasoning here again
baste seasoning put it right
inside right inside
there keep on
going and this fish is going to be steam
and a
steamer on the
stove here we go
so then
now the inside your leftto is
seasoning see you just throw them there
but before you put it just go like that
with the knife make a couple holes and
see and then get all this
seasoning and put them
inside
there we
[Music]
go use all your
seasoning there we
go then you get your
onion
just divide it like that and put it
there in there like that there we
go I have some more onion
here
there
see now I am going to use my
steamer see I have a little bit of oil
here I always try to put a little bit of
oil here on this so it the fish won't
stick to it
so when you
use over
here and then you
get your fish and set it out here see
right here it's all
done all
SE so let oh my onion pack up
okay so
now this thing is too long I you cut the
tail a little bit so I I'm going to cut
the tail right
now so then because the tail is too long
I have to cut it cuz it doesn't fit on
my uh steamer so what you do is just
twist it a little bit see so the bone
will cut just cut all the meat around
the first twist
it it's all done
[Applause]
now I am going to place this in the
steamer so now my fish fit really good
here so there we
go there we
go really good I know I always have to
catch the big fish all the time and
that's why I am having trouble sometime
getting them to fet
hey it's fine to be over there
anyhow now it's ready to go uh to the
stove and we're going to put it in a use
two burners because this container is
too long so then I use un low one or one
and a half low one or one and a half low
it will take about 30 to 35 minutes at
least maybe 40 minutes because it's just
a really big thick fish and it's going
to be cooking with steam so we're just
going to give it a
couple 45 minutes at least 45 uh okay I
said that it will take 30 to 45 minutes
so 40 30 minutes have gone by already I
set the timer so let's see how
looks now we're going to
check let's check from here to the
bottom to
where well it doesn't look like it's
done it's it's not ready yet so it's 35
minutes already we'll give it 15 more
minutes oh now the the fish is done my
trout is done look
oh it's so nice look at that wo that's
really
good now it's done it took 50 minutes
not 45 I know
