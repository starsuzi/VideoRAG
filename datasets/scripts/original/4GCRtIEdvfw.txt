okay everybody this is uh marcus
from your place
and today
we're gonna talk about
uh stains on your carpet
stains on your carpet
can be a big problem
um
there are several ways that i
your um that i go about getting stains
out of carpet and the first thing i want
to say about stains in your carpet is
i get a question at least twice a week
and that question is
can all stains be removed from your
carpet
answer to that question is no
no no any auto detailer out there tells
you
i can come and get any stain
out of your carpet
send them my way cause i need to hire
that guy
but if any auto detailer tells you that
run and you run fast because there's no
way you got to realize people
your carpet
takes the most brunt
brutal
the most
nastiest stuff that you can think of
gets rubbed into your carpet
daily
so there is nothing on the planet that's
going to get rid of all stains
uh from your carpet now with that said
with that said
there's um
all carpets can be improved
um now what i tell people is this
if you can
go ahead and get you some weather tamers
weather tamers is the plastic
hard rubber type floor max that you put
into your car into your floor on your
floor to keep you know mud
and that's the bad part mud mud
on
brown carpet
or mud on any kind of light colored
carpet is
hard to remove
there's no possible way
you're going to get red dirt all of it
out of a
tan
or a light colored carpet
another thing i tell people is you know
before you go buy a new car please
pretty please
please
please get a carpet that's dark get dark
colored carpets
get a black if you can if this is an
option get black
get a gray do not get a light colored
carpet because light colored carpets
will become dirty faster
unless you get the weather tamers
if you get the weather tamers on your
light colored carpet hey you know that's
that's a good decision but just to get a
light colored carpet with no protection
and to call a detailer and to be upset
because the detailer didn't get every
dirt particle
out of your carpet is
crazy
now
purpose of this video is to talk about
things that we can control
like um
jelly
jelly can be removed from carpets
pepto bismol
now i had a girl
how long ago was just about a year ago
girl called
so she was giving a little boy some
pepto-bismol
uh in the backseat of the car boy hit
her stomach eight make a long story
short she spilled pepto bismol
on the floor
of her bmw brand spanking new bmw she
tried everything to get it out could not
be removed pepto bismol
it's a funny color it's it's it's uh
pink
it is hard as hell it's hard as heck as
hard as as hades to remove it
you cannot remove it with just a pc
all-purpose cleaner and a
blotted towel it does not work but let
me show you
show you how we would get rid of that
another bad thing to remove from carpets
is
yellow mustard
yellow mustard on a light colored carpet
is a death sentence for your car
unless you call your place auto detail
and i'll come over
and i got the stuff that can remove this
so you know uh
the point of all this so far is that
dirt cannot be removed if you got a
a carpet mat and it's full of dirt and
that dirt been nursed in 1985
and you call me on the phone hey marcus
can you come and remove all the dirt out
of my
1985 chevrolet blah blah blah
with the carpet max that
looked like
yeah whatever but anyway
that can't be removed all the way
but some stains can be removed all the
way and i'm going to show you exactly
how we would do that
now
let me show you this
don't try this at home because this what
i'm about to do to this carpet here is
not going to be pretty
and luckily
why does it smell right there you know
what
anyway so what we're going to do now
we're going to take pepto-bismol
more
mold more just no bismol so we're going
to take pepto-bismol
and we're going to put it right here on
the floor i'm gonna put it on
the light colored part of my floor here
let you see that
i don't know if i got it but you can see
it can you see that
all right now not only we're going to
put it on are we going to rub it in
we're going to rub it
all right so look at that we got pink
on this brown carpet here
now what i'm also going to do
is i'm going to take some mustard
i'm going to taste some good old mustard
you know normally you're gonna put this
on your hot dog
but i gots to be the only idiot i mean
the only detailer
on the planet that's doing what i'm
about to do now because this is good hot
dog corn dog type
but today
we're gonna put a put we're gonna put it
on our carpet
i guess it'll help if the mustard was
open first wouldn't it so we'll open the
mustard and put the camera down for a
second
and we're going to open up the mustard
now
i know you're looking at blackness but
look at this
i'm gonna rub this
into the floor
right beside the pepto-bismol
oh look at that look at that
that's a big blob of it
all right so we got mustard and we got
pepto-bismol right there
now
top that off
you're gonna throw a little jelly on the
floor
okay we got mustard we have pepto-bismol
and now
we're going to put just a little bit of
jelly on the floor you know to make it
look good
all right
don't have much left here there it is
jelly
pepto bismol and mustard
on the
floor okay so
now what i'm gonna do at this point
right here is you know if you call me on
the phone i'll come to your location
and i see this mess here what i'm gonna
have to do is analyze this situation
and i know
right off the bat i'm going to need a
powerful cleaning agent
but i only have a few minutes on this
video so what i'm going to do is i'm
going to go ahead and stop this video
and let you pick up on part two
so look below or look to the side or
look to the left or right and you should
see something that says part two
