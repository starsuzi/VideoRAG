one, two, three, four!
Rev up your engines!
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel
okay it's happening to all of us, you're
driving down the road and step on the
brake, and you hear awful grinding noise
coming from the brakes, and in this case,
it's coming from the back, so I'll pull
off the tire and check to see what's
going on with these brakes back here, in
this case, the brake pads just weren't
too thin and they've eaten the inside of
the rotor, so we're going to change the
rotor and the brake pads, so I'll get a
wrench and put it on the bolt that holds
the calipers on, take that off, get this
bolt off and then the one on the bottom
too, then with a giant screwdriver we'll
just pry it off get it out of the way,
and the brake router slides right off,
and you can see right here it's all worn
out, so we got to replace this rotor, then
you get a giant pair of pliers like this,
to squeeze the brakes back in, put it on like
this, then I'll squeeze the caliper back
into its hole, you got to squeeze
pretty tight though, then you get yourself a
shiny new brake rotor assembly, and
realize they generally cover them with
grease, so they don't rust, so you get a
can of brake cleaner and you spray it
all over to get the grease off of it,
like this, then turn it around, do the
other side, and the inside, let's just say
grease and braking don't go together you
want to get all that grease off, then you
slide it back on, then get the caliper
and put the brake pads in, but first
we're going to put some anti squeal lube on,
I've been using this stuff for years, you
just put a little around where they go
here and on the ears, then one pad snaps
in the hole and the other side snaps in right
here, and there's something you got to
make sure you do right, you got to make
sure that the ears with two tangs are on
one end, and that the other end has the
ears that only have one Tang on, so it'll
slide on right, then with a little
wiggling, it snaps in place, then you just
put the two bolts on that hold the
caliper on,
you want to make sure they're nice
and tight, then put the wheel and the
hub cap back on, and of course go around
to the other side because brakes work in
pairs, and you'll want to change them on
the axle on both sides, so that they break
evenly, so the next time your brakes
start making horrible noises when you
stop, why not fix them yourself, and remember
if you have any car questions, just visit the Scotty Kilmer channel and I'll answer
them as soon as I get back from paradise
assuming I come back.
