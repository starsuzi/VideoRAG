hello welcome to Leonor's sweet creations
today I'm in Nussloch, in Germany at
Faeimm's home and she's going to make a traditional Malaysian treat called
coconut candy. Hi Faeimm thanks for
having me here
Hi Leonor! You're welcome! Faeimm is the founder
of food explorers a community of food
lovers in the Rhein-Neckar region which
organises regularly cooking sessions
with its international members I will
leave a link down below in the video
description so if you live in the
Rhein-Neckar region you can become a member
and participate in these international
cooking sessions. So Faeimm, tell us a bit
about the recipe and why you chose to
make this one first coconut candy is one
of my favourite treats when I was a
school girl in Malaysia it's very easy
to make so we get a lot of this at
school fundraising projects
so let's start making it! yes!
Hello! today we
are going to make coconut candy we will
need 500 grams of sugar 340 mils of
evaporated milk half a teaspoon of salt
one teaspoon of butter 1 teaspoon of
colouring and about 250 grams of fresh
shredded coconut if you cannot find
fresh coconut you can also use
desiccated coconut so you heat a deep
pan and pour the milk into it and you
have to wait for the milk to come to a
boil before you add in the sugar the
salt and the butter so it's a good idea
to stir it so that the milk doesn't burn
and get stuck to the bottom of the pan
so the sugar goes in now and we're going
to stir it until everything melts
the meantime can also add the salt and
the butter
so now we are going to stir until
everything melt everything dissolves and
then you're going to add the coconut now
the milk mixture looks very creamy now
it's important that you keep stirring so
that you break up whatever lumps if you
see any lumps you can just use your
spatula and just break them up now
you're ready to put in the coconut
so once the coconut is in I just have to
stir to mix it up and it's important to
keep stirring and depending on how hot
the pan is you probably need about 40 to
45 minutes before this whole thing that
thickens up too hard then it's probably
too hot then you can turn the heat down
a little bit so that it doesn't get
burned so you know that the coconut
candy is almost ready when you stir you
can start seeing the bottom of the pan
so just scrape away any brown patches
that form it's a good idea to use a
nonstick pan it makes cleaning up easier
- it's so the coconut candy is almost
ready as you can see it's got a
beautiful golden color and it's quite
difficult to stir so what I'll do now
I'll turn the heat down very low
and guess one way to test the coconut
candy is ready and get a glass of water
and drop a blob in there oh yeah I think
it's ready it doesn't even come off if
it doesn't disintegrate then it's ready
when the coconut candy is ready get a
casserole butter it or you can also use
a rectangle or a square cake form and at
this point if you'd like to have some
color in your candy you can add it once
the candy is ready just scoop it out
into a buttered casserole or a pan if
you want to have one that's rectangular
rectangular in shape or square make sure
you smooth it out tap it down flatten it
so that you have a flat surface
so once the coconut candy is flattened
set it aside to cool to room temperature
once the coconut candy has cooled to
room temperature
I cut lines into it so that those pieces
can be easily removed later on now you
can take the coconut candy and put it
into the refrigerator to cool down further.
Let's try, Faeimm! It's done! So what
do you think? mmm
