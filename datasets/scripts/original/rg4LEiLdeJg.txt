- [Voiceover] There's a
ton of bogus information
floating around about
natural mosquito repellents.
But today, we'll show
you the most effective
natural mosquito repellent
that you can make in just a few minutes.
The main ingredient of
this three part recipe is
lemon eucalyptus oil.
We'll also use vanilla
extract and witch hazel.
Start this off by adding 30
drops of lemon eucalyptus oil
to a container.
It contains an active
ingredient called Menthoglycol,
which in may government studies,
has proven to be as effective as DEET,
but without all the nasty dangers
that DEET is associated with.
Try looking in the natural food
section at the grocery store
or check the vitamin aisle.
Lemon grass and citronella
will also repel mosquitos,
but only for about 30 minutes
before you need to reapply it.
Just don't be like Dave.
Dave though that Patchouli oil
was a good mosquito repellent.
Little did he know, it only
repelled other human beings.
Vanilla extract is
optional, but it'll help
majorly increase the
concoction's effectiveness.
You'll want to add about one teaspoon.
This also makes the
smell much more pleasant.
An emulsifier will prevent the
oil and water from separating
and basically blend them together.
We prefer witch hazel,
but if you're in a pinch,
rubbing alcohol, vodka, even
cooking oils will work here.
Choose your favorite and use four ounces
of whichever you decide on.
Once you've added all the ingredients,
just stir it all very well
until you can see everything
has been blended with
minimal floating bits of oil.
The color should usually
resemble a very thin gravy.
Grab a tiny pieces of foil
and shape it into a small
funnel to avoid spillage.
Now you can transfer the
mixture to a spray bottle
without spilling it everywhere.
I just cleaned out an empty
bottle of air freshener
and the bottle worked out great.
But you can use any type
of spray bottle you want,
big or small.
Just wait patiently to
show off your ultimate
mosquito repellent to all
your friends and family.
Keep in mind, you should
always tell people
what's in it just in
case they have allergies.
So, that's all there is to it,
a four to six hour natural mosquito spray
that's right up there with big pharma.

We've also put together a popular guide
for getting rid of ants.
Check it out here, and
thanks for watching.
Slowly, pour anywhere you see
access holes or live ants.
The boiling water will
kill them on contact
and wash 'em away.
