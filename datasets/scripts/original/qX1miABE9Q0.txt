Hey guys, it's Tessa
from handletheheat.com,
where I love to share sweet treats
with a sprinkling of science,
and today I'm showing you
how to freeze buttermilk.
Now I've done a ton of
side-by-side experiments
on buttermilk and the
various substitutions
and what I found is that nothing
compares to the real thing.
The taste, the texture
that buttermilk provides
is unparalleled.
Now you can see all of these
side-by-side comparisons
over at handletheheat.com.
It's just my Buttermilk 101 post.
I'll go ahead and link
to that below as well.
But I know it can be hard to
always have buttermilk on hand,
and the last thing anyone wants to do
is go all the way back
to the grocery store
just to use half a cup of
buttermilk for a recipe.
So today I'm showing you
how to freeze buttermilk
so that you never have leftover buttermilk
that you don't know what to
do with before it expires
and so that you always
have buttermilk on hand
in your freezer, ready to
defrost to be used in any recipe.
So let's go ahead and get started.
So there's two different ways
that you can freeze buttermilk
and the first one, you probably
have everything you need
on hand.
We're just going to be
freezing it in plastic bags.
Now there are a couple tricks here.
The first trick is that you want to use
a specified measurement
of buttermilk in your bag.
So I'm going to be pouring
half a cup of buttermilk
into my plastic bag and
labeling it that way.
So what I like to do is
put what's in the bag,
which is buttermilk,
and I'm going to write today's date,
and then what I'm going to
do is just open up the bag
and pour the buttermilk right on in.
So once the bag is sealed,
the next trick to actually
lay it down on a completely flat surface.
I like to get any
additional air out this way,
and then you can do this for
all the buttermilk you have.
You just want to be
sure that you're placing
all of your baggies on a
completely flat surface,
and then this goes in the freezer
until the buttermilk is
completely frozen solid.
So once it's completely
solid, what you're left with
is this flat little kind
of tray of buttermilk,
which is super easy to store.
You can slide it in
wherever it's convenient
in your freezer.
You can have as many of these as you want.
Now the next way to freeze
buttermilk is actually
with an ice cube tray.
So with the ice cube tray method,
you really want to make
sure that you pour out
a specific amount of buttermilk
into a measuring cup,
so that way you can kind of figure out
how much each cube of buttermilk
will actually contain.
So I'm going to just pour the buttermilk
into my ice cube tray,
and then that will go into the
freezer until they're solid.
Once the buttermilk is completely solid,
they can be popped out
of the ice cube tray.
You might have to flex
the tray a little bit.
Slam it against your counter a little bit
to get those cubes to pop on out,
but then you can just move
them to a zip-lock bag.
Again, date and label
what's inside the bag,
and then that can go in the freezer,
and then you have small
amounts of buttermilk
that you can use whenever
the recipe requires it.
All right, so once your
buttermilk is frozen,
you'll need to thaw it before
you can use it in your recipe.
So the way I like to thaw
it is either let it sit
at room temperature
until it's liquid again,
or what you can do since these
are both in sealed bags now
is you can place your frozen
buttermilk in its sealed bag
in a tray of warm water,
and it will thaw a little
bit faster that way.
It will take about 20
minutes to come to liquid
room temperature that way.
Now once your buttermilk has thawed,
you may notice that it
separated a little bit.
That's totally fine.
All you need to do is whisk it
to kind of bring it back together
into a homogenous liquid consistency
before you use it in your recipe.
All right, so that's how easy
it is to freeze buttermilk
so that you never have
any wasted leftovers
and you always have
buttermilk ready to go on hand
for any recipe that calls for it.
