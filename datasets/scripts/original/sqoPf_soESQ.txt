hi there today we are making apple
crumble let's start by preparing apples
so I PE approximately 12
apples cut it in half then in two
quarters and remove the Coe this apple
crumble I made probably 10 times now and
every time it comes out really really
nicely and I would definitely recommend
it right so the apples are
cut now cut it again in
half so you want this kind of
size put it in the
tray move the choping B
away so here I've got approximately 12
apples I'm using gala apples um
approximately eight half the kilo and
now we have to do a topping for this um
fruits first of all I will add some
raisins because I really love apple with
raisins so add a handful of
raisins here I've got some sugar 50 g of
brown
sugar we'll add a spoon of
flour and cinnamon just normal flour
plain flour with this cinnamon you can
add how much you want I like a lot of
cinnamon because I like like the smell
it smells gorgeous smells very
Christmasy
actually now St the mixture so every
since all the ingredients are combined
together you can see that the color is
nice and brown it's due to the sugar I'm
using brown unrefined
sugar and the
cinnamon
just to remember one spoon of plain
flour cinnamon and the
sugar great and now we have to cover all
the apples with it so we got hold try
here sprinkle it
around and now we just have to toast
it
that's it that's a
well so every single Apple piece is
covered
right shaky shaky
shaky make sure all the powder has gone
and the apples will absorb all the
powder
that's it there we go every single apple
is covered
now so leave the one to the side shake
it again so it's nice and
level that's it and now let's let's make
the cramble so I've got here
250 g of plain
flour
I'm adding five 50 g of Oats I like this
scamble with extra oats it's a bit
healthier and it's nice and crunchy when
it bakes so 50 g goes
in now I'm adding the sugar and again
Brown and refin sugar 175
G
and the butter 200 butter cubed at the
room temperature all goes
in and now you have to make your hands
dirty to just put it all
inside and combine all the ingredients
with your
hands that's
it so this that this is the longer part
actually just to make sure that you
combine everything very very
nicely you want Little crumbles you
don't want big pieces you want Little
crumbles so I have been working on this
and now you can see there nice and loose
you've got lots of small pieces but also
few bigger pieces so let's just put it
on the crumble so like I said this apple
crumble has got just apples and raisins
however in the past I added the plumes
as well which worked very very well with
the Apple cramble so it's apple and P
cramble so
now just put it on over the apples make
sure you cover every single piece from
the
Apple all the
corners and this will go in the oven for
approximately 40 to 45Â° uh 40 sorry 40
to 45 minutes for approximately 190
degrees I would say after 4 minutes just
check it and if it's nice and brown on
top it should be done so all my food are
covered so I can leave this now to the
side and prepare my dinner and then when
I'm ready after the dinner put this in
the oven and it's all done there we go
