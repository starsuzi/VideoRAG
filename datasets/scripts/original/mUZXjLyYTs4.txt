hi everybody and welcome back to cooking
cheer today on this episode we're making
up one of my favorite appetizers
mozzarella sticks these are crispy gooey
and delicious of course you can order
these in a restaurant but today we're
going to show you how to make these
addictive little snacks up at home so
let's begin
so what i've got here is a block of
mozzarella cheese
and i'm going to slice these into pieces
well i'd say about three quarters of an
inch thick
now if you really want to save time you
can look around the supermarket and find
some pre-cut mozzarella sticks and that
would do just fine as well
then what i'm gonna do is slice them
down the center again just to make them
into sticks
so this is a braiding station and what
i've got here is some all-purpose flour
panko bread crumbs
and a couple of eggs
before i start dredging i'm going to
season the breadcrumbs with some garlic
powder
ground black pepper
we'll just take our fork here and give
it a quick stir
then i'm gonna add oh i'd say just a
couple of tablespoons of water into the
eggs
and beat them nicely just until they're
well combined
okay let's begin the dredging process so
i'm gonna pick one of the mozzarella
sticks up with my right hand and roll it
around the flower so it's nicely covered
of course shake the excess off
transferred into the eggs then i'm going
to switch to my left hand and roll it
around and i'm using my left hand just
so everything doesn't get all gooey on
me
then i'm going to pick it up and put it
in the breadcrumbs and switch to my
right hand and roll it around until it's
nicely covered
now using my left hand back into the
eggs one more time
and we'll just give this a roll around
lastly we're just gonna set this in the
breadcrumbs one more time and coat it
nicely
and roll it around once again
so what this is gonna do is give your
mozzarella sticks a good crispy crunchy
coating
and alternating your hands keeps
everything well organized and clean
then we're going to set these aside in
the freezer overnight if you're in a
rush probably about six hours is okay
all right next what i'm going to do is
add some vegetable oil to a pot
i'd say what i've got here is probably
about a couple of inches
i'm just going to let this heat to about
350 degrees and i usually check mine
with a meat thermometer
now the oil is ready i'm gonna slip the
mozzarella sticks in
fry them in batches about three at a
time just make sure you don't have too
many or they're going to stick together
on you
[Music]
and what we're going to do is allow
these to fry for about two minutes just
until they're golden brown and what i
usually do is just take my wooden spoon
and just give them a little nudge to
separate them so they don't stick
together
now some people might be asking the
question can i bake these i tried that
way back when and i'll tell you the
outcome wasn't nearly as good as frying
them
after a couple of minutes they're nicely
golden brown and i'm just gonna use my
spider strainer and remove them from the
oil
as you can see there's a bit of
mozzarella coming out the side and
that's the way it should be that's
perfectly fine
so i'm just going to set these aside on
a wire rack and repeat the process for
the rest of the sticks
and there you have it our gooey crispy
and delicious mozzarella sticks
served up with some marinara sauce or
your favorite condiments these are a
great snack or appetizer
