installing crown molding crown molding
adds both texture and character to a
room while acting as a decorative border
to your
Decor before you start determine the
quantity of molding you'll
need calculate the length of each wall
and add 12 to 24 in for each wall to
account for losses resulting from angle
cuts for an easier installation you can
use interior or exterior Crown corners
store the crown molding in the room
where they'll be installed for 24 to 48
hours so they can acclimate to the
room's
temperature here's the list of tools and
materials for this
[Music]
project although installing crown
molding with the coped joint technique
takes patience and skill the result is
more professional with this technique
the end of a molding in one Corner fits
perfectly around the molding already
installed to achieve this the molding is
cut using the opposite angle of the
molding already
installed the spring angle is the angle
from the wall to the back of the crown
molding in most cases it's
45째 off the end of a long molding piece
cut a small piece of crown molding and
place it against the fence of the meter
saw with the finished side out the long
side of the pattern should be be facing
down Mark the saw fence and
table this will act as a cutting guide
for the spring
angle measure the distance between the
saw fence and the mark on the table saw
then cut a scrap piece of wood with this
[Music]
measurement place the scrap piece
against the ceiling and make a pencil
Mark below it this Mark indicates the
the lower edge of the crown molding make
more marks around the room with a level
verify that the marks are level and
adjust
accordingly measure the walls from
corner to corner and write the distance
on the top of each wall to 132nd of an
inch below Mark the location of the
studs the first piece of crown molding
is squared on each end cut it to the
dimensions marked on the top of the
[Music]
wall push Corners in place and align
them on the marks nail the bottom of the
molding with a brad power nailer over
the stud
marks then nail on the
ceiling leave 2 ft un nailed on each end
of the
molding
[Music]
lay the second molding along the wall
below the first
molding at the end of the second molding
draw a line to the angle of the first
one cut at a 45째 angle along the pencil
line using a coping saw cut the excess
at a slight angle along the line This is
called a cop
joint adjust and fit the coped joint to
the first molding use a round file if
necessary nail the molding on the wall
and on the
ceiling to splice two moldings position
both moldings as they will be on the
wall find the stud near the intended
splice point and Mark it then cope the
end of the molding that will butt
against the wall on your
right
measure 3/4 of an inch past the stud
intended for the scarf joint then Mark
the other end of the
piece set the saw for a 45째 angle and
cut the
molding nail it to the wall and to the
ceiling measure the second molding up to
the backside bevel of the first piece
this is the shortest part or ceiling
side of the first cut cut this
molding measure back and cut the other
end
Square push the two angled ends together
and nail The Joint then push the squared
end into
place measure cut cope and position the
molding for the last
wall to cut a molding for an outside
corner place a protractor on the corner
to check the
angle set the coped end in the inside
corner and Mark the outside corner
then set the saw to 45째 and cut if the
walls Corner angle is not Square use the
angle measured just before with the
protractor nail the molding on the wall
and on the
ceiling cut the molding placed on the
left and nail it in
place if it hasn't been done apply
primer to the moldings fill small Crocs
in the corners and between the molding
and wall with paintable claing wipe off
excess with a damp
cloth finally paint the
moldings for more advice on molding
