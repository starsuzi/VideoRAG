Now Iris are beautiful they really are. But
the tall flag iris that flowers in early
summer I mean a bed of those looks
beautiful but not everybody's got a
space for them all the time to actually
wait and do all that's necessary with
them but what about the dwarf ones. Iris
Reticulata I looked up on the net what
reticulata meant, it means golden net.
News to me as well but that's what they
like tiny little bulbs like that but
this that little bulb is going to be the
most vibrant thing in the springtime in
your garden I promise you if you planted
that 30 feet away your eyes would
automatically go to it. Now pointed end
up that's all you have to do and a few
crocks in the bottoms, pebbles, polly
balls anything you like can go in there.
Multi-purpose compost. it's nothing
special all it's going to happen is
those bulbs are going to swell up
they're gonna get bigger and bigger and
then a beautiful flower is coming out
usually in shades of blue, purple but
really really vibrant so it actually
stands out in the garden today I'm
planting Iris Reticulata Pixie and it's
from Parkers a really good quality bulb.
It's a beautiful violet blue with each
of the petals marked with a golden
yellow and white. Really does brighten up
the garden in February and March
you won't be disappointed with this
grows to about eight to ten centimeters
a wonderful flower
now don't forget pointed end up you can
get quite a lot here this is a bag of
about fifty but go in there and all
you've got to do is place them around
there don't forget they're gonna swell
up so don't pack them in together
it'll probably put about twenty-five in
here because every one if you
plant them with a bit of space every one
is going to flower and they're gonna
stand out and be beautiful on a patio
because everybody's got a big garden on
a patio or on a a balcony in a backyard
just on a table outside they look
absolutely stunning and Springs
when you've done something like this
just for yourself
Springs worth looking forward to.
They put the little green heads out of
the ground and you think i'd forgotten about them, and up they come.
and be careful though because you could get hooked
on doing this. this is the thing to go
for so it's a a dismal time of year but
it's nice and warm inside this shed and
that's all you have to do they'll grow
quite happily there
I just top it off with another layer of
compost it really couldn't be easier
this is all you have to do if you do
this you'll have success every time just
tamp it down get the air pockets out
cover it over now what I do is I put a
layer of gravel on the top this stops
the squirrels and the birds taking away
and dropping weed seeds on there to
gravel now I'm going to take that
outside, give it a good soak and for the rest of
the bulbs get into the border this is
just a spot because they stand out they
are really marvelous like searchlight
plants really beautiful colors and it
couldn't be easier really you don't even
need a trowel three times the depth a
little roll these are just a spot here
that will do perfectly just pop them in
pointed end up as many as you like
cuz they'll come up and there they
really are good doers as they called
they come up time after time with no
problem at all so you don't have to do
anything over much even more just Tete a Tete in here the tulips down there I've
planted that many I cannot tell you but
it's going to be a riot of colour in the
spring, early summer. This is gonna look fantastic.
