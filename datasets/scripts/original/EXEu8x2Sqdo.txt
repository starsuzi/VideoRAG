what's up everybody this is live with no
hippie barbecue and what I'm going be
doing today is going to be a spatch
chicken for some of you guys that aren't
necessarily into barbecue basically what
that means is we're going to fillet this
uh chicken out now it could be done one
of a couple ways you can just remove the
the backbone or you can remove the
sternum a lot of times depending on how
the chicken is depends on if I actually
take that sternum out uh so anyway very
simple technique is something that you
can use you know you can use your oven
on this you can use a small Grill
whatever kind of Grill you want but
we're going to be doing on this is going
kind of hot and fast um so we are going
to be looking for a little bit of that
charred look to it and when I have it on
the grill what I'm going to do is I'm
going to put some foil on top of it and
then I'm going to put a big old concrete
paper on top of it to kind of flatten it
out while we're cooking so this is
something perfect for what I'm going be
using it for is to make uh just
basically use the meat for tacos but
whatever you want you could eat it plain
you can inject it not inject it we're
just going with a straight easy cook on
this just seasoning a little bit of
peanut
oil as a binder and the reason I'm using
peanut oil as opposed to uh canola oil
or U like
a uh olive oil or something like that is
because peanut oil tends to go bad a
little bit faster and I've had this
peanut oil not to the point where it
might be getting bad but I have had it a
while so we're just going to throw this
on anyway let's come in and take a look
at the preparation before we get to that
though what I'm going to do is remove
this chicken I got this chicken on sale
for like $3 we're going to go ahead and
remove it from the bag I'm going to
remove all the parts give that to my
dogs and uh rinse it off and then we'll
get uh preparing this cocking this
chicken you have two different sides on
it you have the breast and easily
identifiable when you run your hands
through there it's going to be kind of
smooth on the top of it and then we
have the other side which can be
identified mainly cuz you have this
little tail piece here so what we're
going to do let's turn this around I
like using kitchen shears you can use a
knife as well but we are just going to
cut along the sides of this
backbone and if you're
using kitchen she I know a lot of people
like to uh do
those uh Dollar Tree hauls and stuff
like that those kitchen shears will not
work for this or those kitchen scissors
or whatever they call them you need some
real kitchen shears something that's
going to be able to cut through
bone so we're just going to cut along
the side
and once you cut
through just clean up a little bit of
that and you should be good to
go so here's what we're looking
like now if you want you can and
also cut out this
sternum let's just go ahead and do that
right
quick this is just going to help it lay
even flatter on the
grill like I said I don't always do this
it's just an extra step but it will lay
down a little
flatter or you could just push down on
it you will hear it snap
all right so now we have the back and
the sternum
removed so when we put this on the
grills it's going to be extremely flat
it's going to cook very even what I'm
going to do now is wash my hands before
we get into this seasoning part now when
you do this technique what you're really
going to want to do is you're really
going to want to handle this chicken
very carefully it's especially if you
pull out the sternum as well because the
whole chicken's going to kind of want to
not necessarily fall apart but it's
going to be a lot more
delicate so just keep that in mind if
it's something that you want to do so
we're going to hit it with some of this
peanut oil and this really isn't
necessary this chicken is going to have
about 6 hours to sit before we get it on
the grill I just want to get some of
this
seasoning in here and let it kind of
soak in the seasoning I'm going to use
we're going with the cinjun seasoning
and this is something that I got from uh
the Cajun TV network we have some Mr
Pete's cun seasoning I'm going to put a
link to uh the cjun TV network in the
description and the iard above and what
they do is they have a bunch of good
things primarily cun items for sale on
their website so that is a a good place
to buy a few things what I'm going to do
is I'm going to let this go ahead and
soak in for a bit probably about 20
minutes I'm going to throw it back in
the refrigerator then we're going to
flip it and we're going to do the other
side so now this has been in the
refrigerator for about 25 minutes had a
chance to kind of soak in now what I'm
telling you is if you're not shooting a
video where you need to be all clean and
everything sanitary I would suggest
turning this over with two hands just
because at this point is pretty delicate
without having any backbone or sternum
so we're going to do so let's try to
flip flip this over with one
hand all right boom there we
go we are going to hit it
with some of this peanut oil just like
the other
side and now we're just going to come
back over this
again with
our
cinjun season
robe and there's no reason to be too
concerned if you once you can come up
under this skin but like I said as
delicate as this chicken is I don't want
it falling apart right now so we're just
going to go on the top of
it make sure you get all up under these
wings now these Wings do have a tendency
to kind of uh get cooked kind of
overcooked almost uh I've never had a
problem eating them but if you don't
like things a little charred uh that may
be something that you you know you could
cut them off and cook them separately
but we're going just like
this
now let's see lift this up get down in
here so let's see it is 11:30
come on let's get this a little
even so now it's about 11:30 this is
going to have a chance to sit till about
uh
4:00 at that point we're going to be out
on the Weber grill time to go ahead and
get this chicken on the grill and just
so everybody knows what I'm using on
this cook I got about 10 of these bags
of Match Light for free there's a lot of
hippies and barbecue that that wouldn't
cook with something like this and you
know what I'll take anything for free so
that's what we're rolling with use
whatever you
want now as far as getting this chicken
on the grill a lot of times what You'
use is tongs or something like that
since we did remove the sternum and the
backbone I'm going to just put this on
with my hands I have some uh cheap uh
plastic gloves
on so we're going to
actually we're going to go meat side
down I have my vents on this I have my
vent at the bottom pretty much open wide
open and then on the top I have it uh
I'm going to have it about a quarter of
the way open now I'm going to go ahead
and place a brick on this as a matter of
fact let me move this back just a
little I am going to go ahead and place
a brick on top of this what you can do
is take regular household or home bricks
and foil them up rather than doing that
I am just going to use a big old P brick
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to put I'm not going to wrap the
whole thing in foil I'm just going
to put foil on top of the
chicken and then we're just going to
throw the brick
on and that should actually give us ooo
that is hot give us more coverage than
just a regular brick so now I'm going to
go ahead shut her
down and I'm going to cook it till we
get to about 170 um degrees or so on
this let's take a look at this chicken
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
go ahead and take this P off of
here take our foil
off and that's about as flat as we want
it I'm going to go ahead and flip this
chicken now or at least take a look and
see what it looks like on the other side
all right so that's what we're looking
like I'm going to go ahead and pump this
uh pump this heat back up but as you can
see it's like perfect well it's not
perfectly flat but it's pretty flat I'm
going to go ahead and open up this vent
all the way cuz I did shut it down for a
minute so I'm going to go ahead and open
that up all the way and then we're going
to open up this uh top vent all the
way as
well so this chicken has been on here
skinside up for about the last last 40
minutes and I just wanted to shoot this
video real quick because I'm losing some
daylight so what's going to end up
happening is once I get this chicken up
to
about 165 168Â° I'm going to go ahead and
flip it over and get some Char back on
this skin side again and then when I'm
done with that we're going to bring it
in and then it's going to be time to uh
cut this up and go ahead and uh go ahead
and taste it come off the grill pretty
much what I'm going to do like I said
we're going to be having this either for
a salad or for taco so let me go ahead
and eat this little piece right here cuz
that looks
delicious oh
yeah I'm just going to go ahead and
break this down a little
bit we did get a little pull back from
this little leg quarter
but that's
fine one thing you can taste though is
you can definitely taste that uh Cajun
seasoning this on
there let's go ahead and cut that Wing
off and I'm just going to go straight
down the middle
here now you could just cut this from
the
bone but I'm just going to go ahead and
leave this like this I'm probably going
to uh shred this stuff
up like like I said for salad or for
um tacos who knows anyway I'm going to
pull this back for a taste test as you
can see I've already tasted it and that
rub was stupendous I'm going to go ahead
and taste part of this breast though to
see if some of that rub kind of
penetrated in there I already know how
this is going to taste let me just see
if the seasoning kind of got into this
chicken breast so I did cut a piece of
that off and let's go ahead and taste
this right now
still a little
hot that does taste good but you know
it doesn't matter if my girls don't like
it all right Penny Frankie you guys want
some chicken sit down Penny good girl
good girls you guys want some chicken
let me take a
little here you

matter of fact let me take another
