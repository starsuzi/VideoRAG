hello everyone and thank you for joining
me on yet another video recipe now today
U I'm going to be teaching you how to
make some Malaysian chicken curry Puffs
M definitely one of my favorites now
there's a couple of steps to this um
first of all I'm going to be making my
own pastry it's really easy and then
next all I need to do is make a filling
roll them up and cook them and they are
done for the pastry I've got plain flour
two cups which is about 300 G so I'm
actually I'm using my food processor to
pulse this into breadcrumbs if you don't
have a food processor do not worry it's
very easy just to do by rubbing it
between your finger and thumbs in a big
bowl now to the flour I'm going to add
half a block of butter um now that is
125 G and I know block sizes are
different in America so anyway it's 125
G of butter which is cold and I've cut
it into cubes so whenever you're making
any type of pastry a good tip is that um
all the ingredients need to be cold you
need to have cold hands and a cold work
surface all right now to that a pinch of
salt and now I'm going to pulse this
into breadcrumbs
so this is the consistency that you want
just fine
breadcrumbs so now I'm going to pour a/4
of a cup of cold water in that's about
75
Ms so just pour it all in now we're
going to keep pulsing until it begins to
form a bow of dough or pastry whatever
whatever you want to call it
like at
that okay so this is the consistency you
want it to get to it's nice and soft so
now just take all your pastry I'm going
to pop it all into a big
bowl um now you don't need to handle
this too
much okay cuz you don't want it to get
warm but I am put on here I'm just going
to bring it together squish it into a
bowl that's what you need to do
okay now I'm going to leave this to
chill in the fridge for about half an
hour and then we're ready to start
rolling for the filling I've got a large
onion which I've chopped up also three
cloves of garlic and a half well
actually about an inch piece of Ginger
which I've all finely chopped like so um
I've got some potato which I've already
cooked and chopped into bits and also
I've got two large chicken breasts which
I cooked I just wrapped them up in some
foil and popped them in the oven for
about 15 minutes and they were cooked 15
20 minutes is enough but they kind of
like lightly steam when you do it that
way so again I've just chopped these
into small cubes now I'm going to heat
up my walk fry up some spices sunflower
oil okay so you need a thir
bit and I'm going to add my um onions
garlic and ginger into the oil
ingredient I've got some meat curry
powder now this one is a great Brand
This is a Malaysian brand um but if you
can't find this then just use a meat
curry powder I'm going to add a
tablespoon a whole tablespoon of this
want it to have lots of
flavor now if you like uh really spicy
you can always add a little bit more
chili which I'm going to do so I'm going
to add half a teaspoon half a teaspoon
of some extra chili powder right so
we're going to give this good stir
in I've also got a few Curry leaves
which basically these things here you
can find them at your local Asian
groceries so I'm going to add a few of
those in they give A really lovely
flavor so we're going to leave this to
cook for about 5 minutes okay this is
the important part you need to let your
spices cook for long enough to kind of
uh release all those flavors and that's
what it should look like when it's ready
and you can see the oil breaking through
and in Malaysian that's called Peta
minia now we're ready for the other
ingredients I'm going to put the chicken
breast
in M smelling good my
friends and now the potato I'm going to
stir
in I'm going to add a bit of water about
half a cup of
water about a in and a half of sugar and
also a good dash of
salt now we're just going to leave this
to simmer for about maybe 7 or 8 minutes
until the liquid has started to dry out
this is what it should look like when
it's ready as you can see there's not
much juice left now the F filling is
cold I'm just going to add the juice of
half a lime to it okay good that feels
nice and cold which is what you want so
I'm going to put a little bit of flour
down on the work
surface and on my rolling
pin and we're going to I'm going to roll
half of it to begin with and keep the
other half in the
fridge okay that's always a good idea
because then it's not going to um go all
warm so just kind of you know do half at
time it's
fine now I'm going to roll the
dough as a th thin as
possible okay this is about as thin as
you want it okay now we're going to cut
some circles
okay now I don't have a proper Circle
cutter so I'm just doing
that so just keep cutting out as many
circles as you can from The
Pastry as well now just
um don't try and over stuff these okay
cuz if you do the filling will come out
when you cook them so a small amount in
the middle I've got some water here I'm
just running that around the edge and
that's going to help stick it together a
bit
more make sure you squish it down
properly
okay start at one end so using your kind
of like your finger and your
thumb we just move move the pastry
around
okay kind of pinch it and then Fold It
pinch and fold pinch and fold pinch and
fold pinch and fold pinch and fold pinch
it's quite easy once you get into the
hang of it then it gets a lot easier
right then you can start doing quicker
okay we get the oil nice and
hot pop it in
and they
good you just cook them now until
they're go on on each side it's not long
it's maybe like about a minute each side
no longer than
that there you go that one's ready so
there we have H chicken curry Puffs
Malaysian style um I hope you really
