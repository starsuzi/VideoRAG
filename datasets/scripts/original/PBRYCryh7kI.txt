we're doing experiments we've got one
egg that
was a fresh egg so it's not hard boiled
it's completely raw and we've been
soaking it in vinegar and what's it like
now
Max oh it feels really soft that feels
you can feel it it's been soaked in
vinegar since last night and can you see
it moving under my finger so the shell
has started to dissolve in the vinegar
and this other one was a hardboiled
egg how does that
feel that feels really quite soft as
well so we're going to leave that for
another 24 hours and just see what it's
like but because the vinegar dissolves
calcium and the eggshell is made of
calcium
then it should dissolve completely let's
see tomorrow catches then
