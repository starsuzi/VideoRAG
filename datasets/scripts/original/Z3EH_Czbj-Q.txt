all right so we set up an area of my
yard
that we're going to use some garden
edging to separate an area that I'm
going to put sand down and separate it
from my grass so I dug out the area in
the general design that I wanted
and we're going to use this composite
edging that I got from Lowe's and
basically you level the area you put it
down and then you use these spikes to
spike it in
it's pretty flexible and it looks like
it works pretty easy so we're going to
continue along and we'll see what it
looks like
all right I just finished putting down
the um
my rubberific garden edging
and I gotta say this stuff works pretty
good
it's nice and easy to put down you don't
have to dig it out like you do with the
regular garden edging that I've used
over most of my yard you basically just
put it you spike it down
one piece connection to the other if you
have to do a garden where you're doing
big edges
this thing is a pretty good solution
this worked out nice for me um I'm short
one piece which I'll just pick up
tomorrow so on to the next part of this
project
