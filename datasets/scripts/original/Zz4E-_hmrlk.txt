I've been letting this one dry for about
24 hours now and you can see how the
clay is shrunken and cracked its collar
cracks in it because it shrinks when it
dries and a whole lot easier to watch
out if you let it drop
here we go

yeah one didn't break off of there
that's just a
naturally yield point
little pieces laying here
washed around by the water

I'm gonna have to drive for another day
at least I can see what I got it looks
like a nice one
spin it back around here close up
really not much in there for scale but
you look here these are some really nice
size points
absolutely beautiful
museum piece
this ain't going to be absolute gorgeous
homes clean
this is why it's so hard to get truly
flawless pieces because this clay that's
all around it has got all these little
cork shards in them
and
just the play itself with all little
shards and it causes things on them
it doesn't matter how careful you mind
