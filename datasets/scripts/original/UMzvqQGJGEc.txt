internet hi everyone I'm Don from
1aauto.com in this series of videos
we're going to be focusing on vehicle
diagnostics and maintenance tips we hope
that you find it helpful and when you
need parts for your car or truck think
of 1aauto.com
thanks in this video we're going to show
you how to clean up your battery and
neutralize any corrosion acid corrosion
that you're going to have on it
typically happening on the uh positive
terminal you can see this one's in
really bad shape now would you want to
do it well this can cause a no start
condition and overall acid leaking down
is not good as well so what we're going
to do in order to do that is use a
little baking soda little water we've
got a terminal cleaner and we'll finish
it off with some battery protector so
anytime we're working with battery acid
or whatnot uh or this kind of corrosion
you're going to want to wear gloves and
goggles it's a good idea but what we'll
start to do first is mix the
water and the
soda
here all right and you can go ahead and
pour it over
terminal you can see how it's
fizzing it's doing its job
[Music]
that sit for a little bit
[Music]
all right so we got everything cleaned
up here um for the most part I'm going
to go ahead and remove the terminals on
this battery it's just so happens to be
a 10 mm which is pretty standard always
want to do the negative side
first and then the positive
side all right so we got the two
terminals or two leads off and you can
see from this one how badly corroded it
is and should really be replaced
what we're going to do now is use our
cleaner on the
terminal put it on and
twist do the same for the
negative it's not as bad shape then most
of these tools have a little brush on
the
inside just to get the rest of this
stuff
out and if you want you can fill up
another tub
of baking soda and water and just let
that sit in there for a few minutes to
get the rest of it off and while that's
soaking I'm just going to clean up the
rag the rest of
[Music]
this all right so had the soak in for a
few minutes pull it out clean it
up as much of this gunk out of here as I
can good thing is this has been
neutralized so it's not going to cause
any further
damage all right that
said Can reconnect it again like I said
this this should be replaced for the
purpose of this video we're just going
to reinstall this one for now
negative and to prevent this in the
future we're going to use some battery
protector and spray it onto the
terminals all set we hope this video
