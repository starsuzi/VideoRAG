hi everyone today I'm going to make
caramel
pudding first I'm going to make the
caramel for this I'm using a half a cup
of sugar and I'm going to put that into
a pan in medium heat and let it slowly
[Music]
caramelize when you're caramelizing the
sugar make make sure that uh you try to
spread the sugar evenly as
possible when the sugar start getting
caramelized uh lift the pan a little bit
from the heat about 2 or 3 in and start
swirling this will help the sugar to um
caramelize faster and so it won't burn
either so swirl for a while
uh keep the pan again on the heat and
let it um burn for a while then again
you can keep
swirling it took me about 10 minutes to
uh caramelize the half half cup of sugar
if you use a bigger pan it can be faster
because the layer going to be thinner so
uh this is the hardest part
um when making caramel
pudding now I'm going to take the
caramelized sugar and I'm going to pour
that into the baking tray that I'm going
to use to make the caramel pudding so
I'm going to pull everything and um try
to evenly layer in the
bottom after pouring the caramel into
the the pan I'm going to tilt the pan in
all four sides just to cover the edges
and bring the caramel a little higher on
the walls just to make it like a border
around the uh wall of the baking
pan so as soon as I poured the caramel
into the pan the caramel dried so I am
going to turn on the heat a little bit
on the cooker so it to melt again but
make sure that you don't you're not
going to burn your hands when you touch
the pan if it is hot so um when it melts
you can um do the border around like
just like
this now I'm done making the caramel uh
let it sit aside uh don't leave it on
the burner and let's move on to the
pudding for the pudding I'm going to add
five eggs and Bead It
[Music]
Well to the beaded eggs now I'm going to
add one can of of condensed
milk add half a can of the condensed
milk and mix well then you can add the
remaining if you're using a beater this
is just going to be easier if you you
can just add the full can and just bead
it together
[Music]
after adding the condensed milk uh to
the same can I'm going to add one can of
water then another half so it's going to
be 1 and 1/2 of water from the same can
um and put that into the same mixture
and mix together
[Music]
now I'm adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla
extract to the
[Music]
mixture now the pudding mixture is
almost done um now we have to combine
the caramel and the pudding
together now I'm going to pour the
pudding mixture to the pan I prepared
earlier with the caramelized sugar I
have a foiled tray there just in case uh
if I spill
anything and I'm going to pull this to
the pan don't fill it up just leave some
space so um we can bake
[Music]
it so when you bake the caramel pudding
you're going to bake it on a water bath
so you are going to keep the uh pan in a
bigger tray and uh fill that tray
halfway through with hot water for about
an
inch make sure that the water won't get
into the
pudding and uh don't cover the pudding
and bake it for an hour
[Music]
after the hour insert a clean Fork into
the pudding and make sure that it comes
out clean so you know the pudding is
very well
done when the pudding is done take it
out from the the oven and let it cool
for about half an hour after the half an
hour just run a knife through around the
edge just to um release the pudding from
the pan before you turn it upside
[Music]
down so after you run through the knife
around the edges I'm going to turn this
pudding so make sure you take the pan
that you want to put the pudding in and
um turn it
[Music]
around so this is going to be the final
outcome of the caramel pudding make sure
you take the caramel from the Pan um and
it's all good to
go hope you like the video if you like
