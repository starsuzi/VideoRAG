so anyways here at River Rock we're
going to show you how to build a hot tub
pad
now we took the grass away and
we're going to excavate the site down
about six inches throw a couple inches
of gravel and then four inches of spent
in that one corner the rest of that's
going to be pavers and yes we can do it
all in pavers
so here's the second part of
doing our hot tub the pad
we
put the string around and get our level
the level bub and
Spike it so you get your height all the
way around and you excavate it down and
then we'll fill it up with gravel
okay we got a gravel down we have our
frame up
on the outside there that'll be paving
stones I'll be paving stones there's our
cement mixer here comes Luke it's quite
the
we're getting ready to pour this man
anyways there's my truck half empty two
gravel because we're doing doing the
place and in bags because this is the
only way
in through to the backyard top this hill
you go the stairs but
it's not even easier so we're pumping
all the gravel and
knocking the sand and the cement all the
way up here
Terri's again
so this is way we got to go
so it's quite tough and that's why we
use and bags to place and
so we started our pour and that's why
we're doing it so
here we are the next day and we carried
all the bricks up by hand
we're bringing in the crush there's our
cement pad and we're going to build a
stock stone wall on their side there
so we'll put some gravel down dig that
out put some gravel down and we're going
to spent in the flagstone because it's
not a tough pad
so we're going to level all that off and
we'll lay those pavers
standard blend and away we go
anyways we're pretty much completed the
job
like I said the whole thing could be in
pavers it would still hold
and that's it I'm not going to show you
all my little secrets but that's what we
got thanks til next one
you
