you know cloth alterations encompasses a
lot um you know from obviously from
letting clothes out taking them in
shortening them lengthening them you
know there's all sorts of things repairs
um replacing zippers but one of the
things that I do get asked uh to do a fe
bit is to remove
embroidery um from uniform clothes so
for example this particular pair of
trousers are Pier Carden and the my
client doesn't work for this company
anymore and he's paid for the
uniform and of course now he can't use
it so um they've come to me and said
look can I remove that um what I want to
say is you would not want to remove this
with say a quick unpick because I can
tell you something like that would take
you a week at least um because these are
tiny tiny tiny tiny little stitches um
to remove something like that just that
alone you'd be looking at about a
day so don't even try to do it with
something like that what you do
need is this little embroider eraser
um this brand is Peggy's Stitch
eraser um it was on special for $99
Australian um when I purchased it
normally I think they retail for
120 but if you're doing close
alterations
um then you're probably going to get
asked to do things like this
and I have been told that normal clothes
alteration shop um cuz I work from home
obviously but a normal clothes
alteration shop or embroidery shop you
know where you take a t-shirt or a hat
to be
embroidered they would charge around
$50 to remove that that's what they
charge so I don't charge that much
because I work from home I'm half that
so $25 to remove something like this is
worth it to the client $50 is just
pushing it a bit too far so what I'm
going to do is show you how I'm going to
do it um I will speed up the video but
at the end of the day you will see how
long it takes um to do this job you know
we're probably talking
about 20 minutes to take that off
so let's get at
it okay
so what I found is
that it works
better when you go along the
side I mean not always but most of the
time
so I'm going to start here you can see
that they've done on gone onto the label
a little bit there but so I can't really
talk because this makes a bit of noise
but we'll start
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
okay so you can see how that's come
off you want to just stop and check it

[Music]
a
[Music]
[Music]
I don't know if you can see the tiny
tiny little stitches there I mean
they're just
absolutely minuscule
okay so I'm just going to
see how that's
progressing to lift it a little bit just
to catch
it and all I'm doing there is just
really carefully I'm not digging it into
the fabric
[Music]
[Music]
so you can see how that's coming off
[Music]
so see those two areas there that's why
it's not coming off
[Music]
okay so the V is gone just needs to be
cleaned
up so that
took nearly 10 minutes
the Fabric's
fine let's do the rest
[Music]

so you can see that we're nearly
there um that's
taken nearly 10 minutes to do that bit
there we do the rest of it

now now I use one of these first off
just to get all the excess
off you can buy them for like $2 in most
shops clean up all
your
bits this one's a bit different the way
it peels off
pels off on an
angle never had one like that
before
anyway so you see
that the you would think that maybe you
would you
know rip the fabric
or
but it actually
doesn't
so take these pins
out now you can kind of see the outline
of a little bit and you'll get tiny
little bits like that that'll stick in
there which you'll have to just get rid
of I'm going to go and iron it and I'll
bring it back and show you what it looks
like so I've pressed it this is the side
that
had the embroidery on it this side
didn't and you can see that you can just
kind of see the outline a little
bit but you know in all honesty
when someone's wearing that it's it's
and it'll probably fade as it gets
washed a few
times you can see
there that you know the fabric hasn't
been cut or ripped and I managed to I I
did Nick there just a slight little bit
there on the label cuz it's very hard
with it being attached to that label
there's tiny little Nick there but I
don't think the customer is going to
worry about that so so there you have it
something that you can
do with this now I know it kind of looks
like a man's razor and I guess in a way
it is but I think this is a lot finer
than a man's razor but you know if you
saw a little razor or something and you
wanted to give it a try as long as it
wasn't on someone else's clothes um you
know who knows I don't know maybe you
could get it to work I need need to
clean it because after you've done that
sort of work you really need to get all
that fluff out of
it so there you go hope you find that
you're helpful and like I said I would
charge about $25 to do that um and yes
this cost me 100 I guess you could say
um so I've got to do four of these
before I repay it but this is one of
those items that you will keep for quite
some time
so um you know I think think it' earn
its
keep happy altering
