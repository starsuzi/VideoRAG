open this the yes the two plastic bags
and open them with your teeth I
didn't and then when we open it we're
going to put them inside each
other okay stop okay put this like show
up to the camera put this inside here so
now there's two bags in the same one
there's one bag and one another bag okay
then we're going to get the the
ingredients and pour it in here you hold

closer ro we're
filming camera
hey hi okay now since we have them in
the bag we're going to get here should I
the yeah the powdered sugar powdered
sugar and the measuring cup measuring
cup and so this is what it looks like
inside the back it looks kind of
disgusting but we open up the powdered
sugar and we're going to put two cups in
here in there
[Music]
back
sorry oh my don't try to spill on the
floor and then after that the reason why
we have it in the bags is so we can
shake them around and then we can make
money bunes and then we oh no we forgot
the main ingredient but we you're
supposed to put vanilla in it like two
teaspoons in it but it doesn't really
make a difference it just makes it sweet
I don't know where the vanilla is
neither do I so now we just mix it up
can you help mix it
up okay Dany dance oh that doesn't look
too good yet okay shake it more we need
to mix it a little more okay usually
when we're done shaking it we pour it in
a pan since we have a big family so we
all share him so now we're going to pour
him into a pan we don't know how they
look on the bottom
so not that good we should have Shake
Shen it more then we spread it out look
at that big trunk my big chunk look at
that big chunk right there oh she
smashed it and sometimes in here we kind
of just around if there's up that was
too big there's still a couple of trunks
okay and after that you have Muddy
Buddies if you look online there's
better but since we're children we are
not the best but look that's a big chunk
it's like an egg okay and then after
this the main ingredient eat
it no put them over here
okay crazy yeah they call me dad that's
how I'm know in my crew and by my crew I
mean my kids when I take them to school
yeah I'm cool I got them roller blades
in a fanny pack just to hold my shades
got snacks in the back peanut butter and
grapes in case it's one of them cranky
days
