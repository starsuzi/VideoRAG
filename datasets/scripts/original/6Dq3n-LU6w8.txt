all right today we're going to make CER
or Tulu the Turkish version so this is
um we have some crushed wheed or bulgar
uh make sure it says like number two on
it if it number one is too fine and
anything like number three or number
four is too
thick if it doesn't have a number on it
it should be about the size of like the
raw sugar or something like that so I'm
going to put about half of this package
which is about 8
oz 10
[Music]
oz into a bowl into a big bowl that has
a lid or a pot that has a lid and then
we also want to put the salt in right
now
what the
salt put the salt in
there and just mix it up we've got some
water on the boil so wait until that
boils
okay our water is boiling and we're
ready to put it in with the crushed
wheat the Bulger uh don't forget to Salt
it at this point it's very very
important otherwise if you salt it later
it's just not the same so I'm going to
put the water in
slowly and um we're going to make it
like we make ramen
noodles you just want the water to
barely cover it
let's give it a
spin and then close the
top okay now we
wait let's check on this open it up uh
leave it about 10 15
minutes at least I mean you can leave it
longer it's nothing bad is going to
happen but uh you need to leave it at
least 10 15 minutes if you're not sure
it should be all nice and fluffy like
this if it there's still water left at
the bottom that's okay if it's just a
little bit if you can drain it try to
drain it
otherwise uh you can always add more
water just taste a little
bit and if it's really crunchy and not
cooked then you can go ahead and add a
little bit more water close the top
again so this is
perfect now we're going to add some
tomato
paste some
Su and we're going to mix it
up if your tomato paste is the the
really thick you can also do this by
hand it's kind of quicker and you get a
better mix if you do it by
hand you don't want lumps lumps of
tomato paste in
there all right
good notice I'm not I wasn't squishing
it just mixing it gently you don't want
to squish it you just want I get a good
mix on
it
okay this is ready we're going to set it
to the side now let's get some parsley
for this I like to use the flat Italian
parsley because if you don't chop it
real fine the curly one it kind of
sticks to your mouth and it you know
it's kind of sharp so if you didn't get
it last time just kind of grab it like
that and then that's how you do
that get it in some get it in some
water the stems are okay it's fine if
there's stems left on it uh stems taste
good we're going to chop it real fine
anyways it's not going to
matter let that sit for a couple of
minutes in the water get all the dirt
off now uh cutting board I like to put a
damp paper towel something under the
cutting board and it doesn't slide
around
I'm going to show you we need some green
onions I'm going to show you how to
clean these just cut the end
off and then you see this one doesn't
look so good it's the very outside one
we're going to take that
off make sure all that slimy stuff's off
and the ends kind of not looking so good
so we're going to get that off
too and then we're going to wash it so
so let me show you this again cut the
end off the roots and then see how this
one's kind of not so happy let's get him
out of there here we go get that yellow
end off of there so I've already done
this we're going to chop these don't put
them in the chopper it's going to just
be mush so let's get a little Bunch
together I'm going to show you try to
show you how to chop
these um first thing is oh always keep
your fingers in like this the ends of
your fingers so you want your knuckle to
be sticking out and you're going to set
the knife up against your knuckle and
there's no way you can ever cut your
finger if you hold it like this we're
going to make sure let me show you like
this make sure the tip of the knife is
always touching the cutting board and
we're just going to do this circular
motion like this it's very simple okay
ready here we go let's do it slowly
see and then once you get comfortable
with it you can go
faster always keeping you the tips of
your fingers
in there we go couple more little
chops there's some big pieces in there
all
right let's get that in our Bowl
now let's do the other
[Applause]
one and here we go
okay so my battery died so I had to
switch cameras so sorry if this is bad
quality but um so we're going to do the
tomatoes now I like to use these big
Roma tomatoes because they just the size
works out better in the shape so first
we cut it into thin pieces like this uh
maybe about 1/4 inch and then we're
going to cut it into strip so just break
it up into pieces like this so uh
strips and then dice it into little
squares I don't like having big chunks
of tomato in it if you want to it's your
preference um so we have it diced about
like that I don't know how well you can
see
that and then I've already done some
over here so I it's all preference how
many how many tomatoes you want um I
like a lot of tomatoes
and you know don't waste the juice if
the juice squishes out of it get it all
in there it gets nice and gooey turns
out really nice um and then we got lemon
going to need some lemon for sure
squeeze oh for about this much I like to
put probably about two lemons the lemons
are nice and juicy you can do more if
you like it just maybe put one one and a
half and then taste it each time to see
if you like it how much you like it
lemon uh I just it's quicker for me to
do it by hand so I do it that way you
can use a squeezer if you want to or
whatever they're
called
next we're also going to put some olive
oil in
there so let's let me show you like this
here we go let's get some olive oil um I
would say
about four five tablespoons maybe more
when we W mix it we're going to know uh
we got to get some more salt in there
cuz now we've added tomatoes and other
things so we just want enough salt to
Salt the tomatoes cuz we've already
salted the
bulgar and be careful if you use a
tomato paste that's already salted then
just be careful of that I use unsalted
tomato paste but just depending on what
you buy or what you
have so we'll do a little mix oh we
still need to do the parsley and I just
kind of here let me show you just kind
of squeeze it if you want to strain it
strain it but still kind of squeeze it
and get the excess water off if you have
one of those salad spinners you can put
it in there um we don't want any excess
water in there so here we go again with
the
chop
now we want to chop this as fine as you
can get
it
um you're not comfortable with chopping
it you can put it in your
chopper with a little bit of olive oil
put a little bit less olive
oil in your bowl and put some of it in
here and you just kind of go
around
or we can do something
fun no we can't CU I don't have the big
knife okay let's get that in
there parsley is the key um so Tulu has
a lot of versions the kind of Lebanese
and Arab versions they do mostly
parsley and um we don't we do
mostly bulgar mostly wheat and uh The
Parsley is a big part of it but it's not
the it's not the biggest part of
it but everyone definitely has their own
version of it there are versions of it
in turkey that where you don't put any
tomato paste in it and you can do that
too I I like it better this
way
all
right should be
enough okay
now now it's looking right there we
go and then mix it all
together put it in the fridge it's good
nice and cold you can eat it just like
this you can serve it with a couple of
pieces of
lettuce around a
plate I like to just put it in a
[Music]
oh and there you
are a so
pretty let's taste
this
