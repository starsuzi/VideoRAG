hi guys welcome back to the 100 channel
this one maybe only 2011 Ford Focus it's
coming because the lady said that the
window and the driver solid has gone all
the way down she sent it down to clear
the condensation this morning and we
went to put it back up no go it's stuck
down so let's just take a look at it so
this one came in to me we've this window
look down the lady said this morning she
just got in it just to clear the
condensation off the windows she rolled
the window down excuse me on the one
touch like you normally would do it
wouldn't come back up this is how she
drive it into me I got this in and
basically held the switch up gave the
door a good whacking and he came up did
that a couple of times and every time it
goes down to the bottom it does seem to
stick so let's just give that a go now
give it the One Touch roll the window
down all the way down you hear it click
off nothing won't come back up click
push down again you can hear the click
nothing there driver-side not a problem
all the way down all the way back up so
this one it white so let's see if I can
get it up again I'm suspecting either
switch connection or motor dodgy
connection in the motor
[Applause]
so
the speed of it going up appears to be a
little bit slow we can lubricate the
channels with some silicon spray or
something you do you think okay that's
good let's just go to the bottom
manually that's all the way at the
bottom stuck again
that becomes something sticking i'm sure
the switch is okay dodgy connection on
the motor or in the motor let's get the
door panel off right let's leave a panel
here pop that out let's have a little
peek it's a bit bit too thin for a
plastic trim tool just get that in
you go they're gonna be easy to snap
you've got another one
what's it be on there 22:24 is it - 25
pips
say that yeah try okay how are you
supposed to get back an architect I
really don't know
got it tough to get out damn so another
one here 225 okay next this trim panel
here
[Applause]
yeah
oh I know for the Switchback looks like
pops up here I ain't like that simple as
that
so we're suppose we could check from
this switch when we're actually lifting
it up that it is giving us power all the
time it is we think because when you
hold it
it's banging the door it does go up just
give it a quick check now
ha
not someone from up
why is that
around the green trace it all the way
down let it go down and I just clicked
off inside here I felt it inside this
little switch module there we go there's
proof that we are actually giving it
power
let's test bobis lighting so the switch
is good Pacific and keep that in there
and bang the door at the same time there
we go is going up so we kept the power
all the time so we've got no problem
with this switch switch mechanism itself
good it's disconnected
[Applause]
so we've got a mother 2:25 just there
and they're just hiding under that
fabric
[Music]
and then if we take out this reflector
piece by taking these up just think
they're gonna snap oh yes
so that just slid out that way
some little grooves on the end there
well I think I need to take off this
tweet panel runs down the side here
this comes out
disconnect the tweeter just there
I'm pretty free that bend on the right
hopefully now this
okay just show you that sort of just
goes it goes in an angle and clicks in
like so in there and clicks in and this
part of the cable hooks me on a little
hook of the interior handle the membrane
piece it so gooey or just stick back on
when you want it to look
[Music]
one side bitter cider
obviously okay do anything with the
motor needs to get it out so that's
gonna come out all as one window
regulator assembly
okay all right so I need to get the
window disconnected
that's switches plug back in
it's down a bit let's see it's the
position where we can undo the plastic
job is is it
you know plastic plastic glass holders
go through a hole in the glass so the
plastic glass hard to go through a hole
in it out and lock lock it to the
regulator to see that to be honest so
this is the glass here obviously that
beats the glass and there's a hole in
the glass and just there there's like a
spring-loaded hook hooks into the into
the glass so I would imagine from this
side we just pushed that out big hands
in the way but we would just push push
it out both sides get the glass up and
we take the glass up
that's it that's the glass released
there we go that's the technique if the
glass don't get somebody to help you
because it's a bit awkward on your own
lift the glass up and loop some tape
over the top and over the top of the
frame holds out up out of the way then
oh my god he got a knife to it so what
type back these off a couple of turns
looks like they're just gonna lift up
and push back
I need to take them all the way up
push that back and then we should be
able to bring it all forward and
disconnect the wiring we have got blue
one here as well okay so some wiring and
stuff needs to be disconnected
it's wiring being held into the bracket
of the motor assembly they're released
tap down on that bit of wiring as well
just to bring it over that connector
we've got a piece of tape that's holding
it just it's a wire straight forward
Moser
basic tap underneath there and slowly
lean back a little bit the waggle just
in time for the phone where hey yeah
alright peeps so it's in the car that
way that way around what I was trying to
show you if the window is the window
drops down into these slots just there
and there's a peg just inside there
push-button the base that you're pushing
that like that so that you're releasing
the glass from the hole so ya say that's
it's in the car black way around I'm
just going to connect this up
send this window all the way down and
see if it stops again it may be a case
we might be able to just take the end of
the motor off and clean up the brushes
if not it's a case of three screws there
and lift the motor out of the geared cog
for these cables here
just a ground on one side to be positive
on the other side it's going to go one
way or the other and turn the bleep off
okay that's off
[Music]
all right so
it's coming right down
what that's all the way down so if I
swap these over give it power again we
should be sending it all the way up
what it did was click
I'm going to get a good tap on that
some of the tap it with any screwed
hey goes good right we have a sticking
water so I do this so we can't all see
it right phone keeps me
for that made in China you know
we've got nothing to lose it needs a
motor so we might go take a peek
 smells a little bit electrically in
here
electrically electrically you know me
corrosion never ever say it wasn't very
good then so we have got a lot of
corrosion in there guys
I'm just winding that out of there
brushes have just popped past
there you go
it's unwound it from the gear inside
looks a bit brown and very Brown well
that's got water inside there you go
what do you know yeah that shouldn't be
in there boys
that's just made my mind up I'm not
gonna bother cleaning this up not with
the watering guessing toilet inside that
might do it onto the Fords and see see
if we can get another one
okay colder forts you can bowie the
motor which will obviously unscrew from
the regulator separately however it
wasn't much more toward the motor and
the regulator already assembled I
thought there was just the amount of
water that came up and when we were
sending the motor up with the glass and
it was quite labouring quite a lot so um
I spoke to the customer and she agrees
yeah just just replace the whole thing I
don't know whether we're gonna see in
there but you might you might not it's
quite brown and cookie in there it
should be nice clean clear or white
grease normally or the waters got a bit
crappy so we'll replace the lot and then
we've done that got a proper job there
so that's an order we'll come back
tomorrow it's the next day
would have given me a delivery
the part number there pause that if you
have interested so it's some quick look
as the box came a bit damaged to pull it
open and check it got ourselves a new
one so that's how it's going out any
differences this is white and the other
one was there's a black cover same
manufacture let's get it on what for
this so this time what this is probably
the weight should have come out in
reverse
down into the swamps
so these have got Loctite on already on
these screws sperm so you've got to them
just not worry about it do them up snug
them down right so before we go any
further I'm going to lower the glass
down sorry that goes in there look I
thought should I be the other side money
to be there that's my key that's back in
let's get our switches back in send this
regulate it down and then collector
window glass back up
right down to the bottom and up so they
bother there about there so I can see it
pay you back off
down severe get lined up in the swaps
too far down the past I should go in
there spread it apart stop them in shoot
click into place so what happened that
one's in
yep that one's differently in size that
go up scum if it even ended before
awesome
I just get this door panel put back on
[Music]
the way down okay
good get this glass of clean now we are
done skiing
[Music]
Oh
[Music]
that's the thing guys that's how you do
your window regulator stroke motor on
your 2011 Ford Focus not too bad of a
job at all really probably one of the
easiest ones I've done in a long time
I just want to give a little shout out
to mark from solid Diagnostics mark
thanks buddy you sent me for a wiring
diagram just in case I needed it as it
