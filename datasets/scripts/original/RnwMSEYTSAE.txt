well what we have here
is a bad set of uh
risers at least one is but it's starting
to cause the other ones to
fail um this deck was built back in 2009
they did a lot of shoty work I've
already had to do one repair already to
the middle of the deck cuz it was
actually split apart I don't know what
the hell they were doing there but now
my stairs are collapsing so I'll be
enlisting the help of my friend CJ we're
going to replace uh the risers the
boards are still good the 2x6 Step
Boards are still good so yeah we're just
going to replace them and I got the new
ones already so let me get those out
here real quick all right here they are
three of them I probably could get away
with just replacing the one that's gone
bad but yeah one's going bad the others
are probably not too far behind so yep
so I got
three
and uh so yep that's what we're going to
be doing we'll just take the boards off
and uh replace the the risers
so fun Home
Maintenance back at it
again okay it's the next day yeah we
couldn't get around to it it was ran out
of daylight so
bricks
risers and repairs let me get my
drill and situation oh look and bonx
come and see what we're
doing what you doing bonx we're fixing
our
steps what you think you want to help
you just going to eat
morels keep munching on the
plants yep that's what you're doing it's
going to keep on
munching you and your chin
sack
all right let me get
the yeah here we are drill
battery oh my goodness my racket for
carpenter bees oh
look we got
one look you can
tell one Carpenter B this one works
great ones I
built oh
nothing it's like all for show I guess I
don't
know all right
batteries
the you can tell they're mine
rvr well even silver all right these
things are about shot they don't last
very long so three will probably oops
that won't help either three probably
won't be enough to do the job but we'll
see any who we'll get started here in
just a
bit D yeah there you go let me see your
bit break out the heavy artillery here
Ryobi
man Dam it looks like that drill B would
hurt wow what do we use that for
I con no it's not concrete obviously
drilling through some 6X sixes
maybe oh that might be what it was for
huh that's pretty
cool don't need Hammer little Hammerhead
setting at least the screws are coming
out pretty
easy
yeah must
[Music]
one H amaz they use Phillips head on
there but most of the deck boards are
those uh hex
bits not even sure those are decking
screws no they look like inch and a half
they're not even long enough I don't
think they look gray but yeah
rust yeah yeah
2009
huh BX is freaking out in the garden I
don't know what the hell she's
doing running back and forth nibbling on
the
plants crazy
rabbit yeah there she goes back and
forth It's got an own little racetrack
over there I guess I don't
know almost ready there's something
holding it in on that side nail they put
a nail in it figures what you
doing yeah so there was a couple
Nails
yeah
rotten wow rotten
screws man let's take a look at this
damage you get these out of your shed I
don't know I thought they supplied those
man that is serious rot from a damn
Riser the hell they get those things
from it's like it's not even
treated ow I just bit my Thum oh man
you just have to oh it's full
them big black ants oh really the black
ants are moved in one just crawled out
of there yeah so probably those black
carpenter ants yep there's a big one too
holy
crap yeah them and the damn carpenter
bees they love this treated wood yeah
they use whoops
damn
wow wow watch your to
yeah you got work boots on I got
sandals dress for the job
wow they took a lot of shortcuts on this
damn
thing we got it for a good price but
again I guess you get what you pay
for waiting now you
yeah
[Music]
beamus at least those boards are holding
out I
[Music]
guess
beamus we're supposed to go to Andrew J
stayart today oh
really cut it off right
here oh
okay oh beatin
miss wow
firewood that'll Burn yeah I tell you
that don't look treated no doesn't that
don't look treated at all wow they
actually make ster risers that are not
treated yeah they in your house that's
probably what they use and that's why
these things are rotten
out good
yeah that's not treated
jeez that's white it's not even close to
being treated wow yeah look at this
there's
comparison back it off here yeah they
use inside stair rails or ster risers
instead of outdoor
treated jeez man talk about shortcuts
holy
crap yeah
that's so
soft
wow
unreal
now all looks good let's just put some
cinder blocks
there get old Nails
out
D what was that Wish Fish you got some
worms hell yeah some good ones there a
big old earthworm that's what those we
found a brown snake yesterday cleaned up
that's what they eat is those
earthworms a brown snake yeah a little
baby brown snake no such thing yeah
around here it's actually black snake
yeah now I looked it up cuz I saw the
pattern and looked online sure enough
it's a brown snake brown snake yeah
that's what they call it it's not
poisonous uhuh nope we got a lot of good
snakes around here the black snakes like
the black racers snakes yeah black
racers rat snakes yeah the rat snakes
the uh um garter snakes we got a lot of
good snakes in this area copperheads you
know Common
but
okay little
comparison they hand cut these do
they frak
sakes
thought it was going be an easy swap out
but I guess
not
huh all right we're developing a
strategy here that's the proper Riser
these were handcut or handmade whatever
and are Whitewood so they're trash
that's why they're rotting out these
boards were custom made to fit those
custom risers so these boards are
probably not going to be able to use so
now we're breaking out some scrap 2x
sixes to cut to make new steps for the
proper
risers what an
adventure
huh not too
bad
yeah all right we're getting a plan
together here just going to go with two
steps and then we'll probably put brick
support
underneath and
uh yeah this is kind of an experiment in
progress cuz this was not put together
well they all custom made everything
here on these steps I have no idea they
did that now we need some actual decking
screws CU those aren't going to
work fun fun
[Applause]
[Applause]
fun can't believe this blad cut yeah
it's still doing good sitting out here
for so long all that and after building
the mighty Mega
Shed
cool
okay so we had to put a
little block against the 4x4 to catch
the
stairs
so yeah they really half ass this thing
so do the same probably over here may
not need bricks after all with it
anchored like that
so yep now we're going to have to make
some new steps cuz those are custom
ripped as well so
too much work to rip them to the size we
need so we'll just use scrap 2x
sixes fun fun fun yeah and there's the
screws like two and a
half yeah about 2 and 1/2
inch hex
[Applause]
tip
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
don't want to split the
[Music]
[Applause]
risers another brick support
D
Hurt
good
yay the
stairs that looks
beamus
all right we're still trying to figure
out what we're going to do with this Gap
here so may just try to put a makeshift
board or something down there I'm not
sure we got concrete that's kind of we
have to chip away so I don't know we'll
see but at least we're getting some
proper steps in place now
so that's
good
[Music]
almost
[Applause]
and use a 2x4 to fill in the gap that
actually doesn't look too
bad all patchwor that's pretty much
[Applause]
it well I got to find some more screws
but
uh yeah because of the way this was
built really we're kind of limited on
how we can make this right so because of
the G Gap 2x1 would have worked but we
didn't have any we only had 2x8s and 2x
sixes so we just threw a 2x4 in there
and uh yeah I mean it'll work it's not
perfect we'll stain it another day but
uh yeah coming along
nicely give me your pH Up
okay yeah that'll work out
nice
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
a
bamus it's the wrong
screw break out the
Corless
[Music]
[Applause]
pretty
solid
nice oh sweet that fixes that
issue for now yeah only way really to
fix I guess would be to redo the whole
damn deck cuz this third third exactly
Square either oh
yeah they just one side's a little
longer than the other but yeah this is
the third repair I was thinking about
that repairing the center piece had to
put supports under
here they didn't do that there's a block
yeah block right there for support on
both sides and now
stairs
yeah shoty
workmanship that's not the prettiest
 no but hey a lot better than what I
had should work walk on it
yeah oh yeah I'm about 240 so yeah
definitely
solid no creaking no breaking
nothing awesome bit yeah
perfecto
