hero I just want to say one thing this
Lobster was almost 6 lb 6 pound $11 a
pound this is about $66 right here think
about that and that's wholesale cost you
the ramen noodles the egg and whatever I
ex that expensive but all the other
ingredients when you add this up
probably close to $65 our cost yeah we
don't have a K in it here so we don't
even have a clone here yeah exactly
that's going to be another dish that's
very very good to mention that but thing
about this if you were to do this
Edition repeat it cost you around $65
how much would you sell it for I mean at
least you have a dou your money be like
$130 you know with the other dish okay
let's give it a try first I going to
take Soup
mhm oh
flavor actually look way sa so heavy in
lober yeah it's hard to pick up compl
completely unbalance but in our favor
because of the
lobster so when you're on a protein
diet more Lobster than pasta
Ramen and now Lo pass
little to taking out a little
bit I'm going to use
that knife and a f in that
Len I'm going to try the soup myself
while you're having
that
wow like you says a lot of lobster

the sesame
oil it seems like the flavor is so much
deeper than one you get from the packets

on scallions you got the bamboo wow that
is
huge have some Lobster with your ramen
noodles how's the meat is it pretty
tender
