in this video i'm going to show you
uh how i use my 32 ounce dry container
to ground some coffee bean so here is a
bag of two pounds uh starbucks coffee
beans but i'm gonna put probably three
cups of coffee beans in to ground using
this dry container
okay so now i'm going to
start and
turn my dial from 1 and immediately to
10. okay let's start
[Music]
as you can see it's rising
[Applause]
[Music]
i think i need temper
and this is my first time grounding so
uh it's just an experiment
so let's see if this
this will help so let's start again
[Music]
yeah the temple will have a little bit
[Music]
i'm going to open this up and just kind
of like
oh it's pretty pretty fine because
i'm not sure if you can see but i'm
going to just kind of like
yeah and in fact it's kind of warm
so i don't think we should ground it too
long maybe it's a little bit
too long
but yeah this is my first time
experiment using this 32 ounce dry
container
ground my coffee bean i think the result
is pretty
pretty unbelievable
so i guess i'm gonna use this to grab my
coffee bean
ground some sesame seed and
yeah
this is pretty good
