Hello and welcome to my laundry room.
I'm excited to do this video
because it's been a long time coming.
Most people don't realize
that they're poisoning themselves
through their laundry detergent.
I walk down the street
and I smell it
just a 100 feet away
from their house.
It's just,
I go out into my backyard
and you smell the neighbors,
these toxic chemicals.
I have to stop and go back in.
I can't smell it.
Can you imagine
what it's doing to their skin
and they're breathing it in their homes.
I've been in homes
that I couldn't go in to.
I'm like - Oh, no,
I'll talk outside.
Because the inside of their homes.
Oh, my goodness.
It is just so heavy
hanging of toxic detergent odor.
It's just crazy
that people can't make the connection.
So what I want to show you today
is what I use
and some things that
I want to recommend to you.
It's just so hard
on the liver and the kidneys.
Your neighbors,
your pets and the environment.
The most dangerous ingredient
in detergent has been
categorized by the EPA
as a Class 4 carcinogen.
And your skin is your biggest organ.
And, you know, detergent,
people just use so much of it.
OMGs.
If you don't want to do this,
the easiest thing to do is
go to your health food store
and find a plant based detergent.
OK?
Derived from plants.
I used baking soda and borax
as well in my washer.
It didn't really work that well for me.
These two just couldn't get it out.
I think they're great for a boost.
An additive to your
typical detergent.
I think that would be good,
or to any of these,
but on their own - No.
Sodium sesquicarbonate.
That's been around for centuries.
Basically, it's salts.
It's natural.
It's a good additive.
I like adding it as a booster.
Speaking of salt,
just go in your kitchen
and grab your laundry detergents.
Salt is a amazing cleaner.
It disinfects.
It whitens
and it's really good on tough stains.
It's funny how you could just
go into your kitchen
and get your laundry detergents together.
Apple cider vinegar.
This is great stuff.
I really like it.
The clothes do not smell like
apple cider vinegar after it,
and it does not stain your clothes.
In fact, it does the opposite,
it brightens it, and it softens it.
Some people like to use
a little apple cider vinegar
in their rinse cycle,
because it really does
soften the clothes naturally.
Non toxically.
So I do like apple cider vinegar.
How, for this bottle
it's six bucks.
OK?
In a Wal-Mart.
You could get organic
for a few pennies more
if you're into organic.
And then we have the
distilled white vinegar.
It's a lot cheaper than
apple cider vinegar
and it works just as well.
Speaking of the kitchen,
lemons also have a
role to play in the laundry room.
It really freshens,
brighten's.
It gives it such a really nice smell
of course, that lemon scent, but
it cleans and
I like adding it to all my wash.
I always have
a jar of lemon juice in my fridge
it lasts about..
I change it up every about three days
because I use it in my salad
and in my laundry.
It's just a nice booster for it.
OK.
Hydrogen peroxide.
Great cleaner.
It does brighten, disinfects.
It's not bad for the..
None of these
are bad for the environment.
It's good for your skin.
I do like using this
as a booster or an additive
to my wash.
And this is miracle soap.
I love this.
Just a little like
cap full in a large load
will do the trick.
It'll get your clothes
clean and smelling really fresh.
And I love the ingredients.
First ingredient is prayer.
Second ingredient
electrically engineered
eloptic energised water.
Calcium.
Potassium.
Magnesium.
It's amazing.
Markus uses this as a shampoo.
And I've used this in my
soap water as well.
In a pinch.
If you don't have anything,
you can use your shampoo.
Any shampoo.
Just a little bit.
If you don't have any of these on hand,
then a little shampoo could,
you know, shampoo.
And I always have a
spray container of vinegar and water.
And I use it
in the laundry room
and I use it when I
am removing stains.
I like to pre-treat it
and I can't believe how this works.
It's amazing.
What I do
is I use
about a third,
a third cup of
little detergent
in my really soiled clothes,
as I mentioned before.
And then I'll take
a little bit of vinegar, or
baking soda.
I like using vinegar in my rinse
and the baking soda for washing.
But remember, in school
we used to mix vinegar and baking soda,
and we'd have a..
Volcano.
So, avoid that.
And another really important thing
that helps the environment is
when you're doing laundry.
It takes about 40 to 70 gallons of water
to do a load of wash.
So what I do is I
wait until I have enough
to make a big load
and then I do that.
I never use,
do a small load.
It's just not worth it.
And cleaning your
lint screen every single time
you use it or before you use it
also makes your
dryer run more efficient,
thereby saving you energy.
So I'd love to hear
what works for you guys
because I'm always in search
of bettering my world,
myself and everyone else.
So please, if you have great tips,
I'd love to hear them.
So, I just wanted to open some people's eyes.
If you're not really,
if you're going through life,
not really giving,
thinking about
what your laundry detergent
is doing and how it's affecting your body.
Now is the time
to think about it.
Okay?
So,
check it out
if you don't believe me,
Google.
Do your research
and see how absolutely toxic
to your liver, your kidney,
your lungs, your breathing passages,
your skin, everything.
The typical
laundry detergents
do and affect you.
Okay, so
I really hope to see you
in the kitchen next time.
But I had to do this laundry video,
because it has been
a constant for me for decades,
just being in front of somebody
or behind somebody
and having to cover my nose,
because they are emanating
the most toxic detergent smell ever.
People just use way too much detergent.
Our clothes are not that dirty.
OK, so
I look forward to seeing you again
really soon in the kitchen.
My favorite room in the entire house.
OK, well, I..
It's the weekend, so
I am looking forward to having
a peaceful, relaxing weekend
and having some nice fun
and good breathing air
in Red Rock.
All right.
Thank you again for joining me.
I can't wait to see you next time.
Bye.
