Ok today I wanted to go over the
five most common problems with washing
machines with you
the number one
most often problem with washing
machines is a washing machine that doesn't
drain or spin
most often caused by a broken lid switch
you should hear a click
as this goes into place
If you don't hear that click then your
or if your washing machine is not going
into its final cycles
it's most often this lid switch here
sometimes you can just press on this right side
and get it to engage the switch also occasionally 
you can just adjust the post a little bit
uh... so that the post will stick further
into the switch which will engage the switch also
sometimes you can't just adjust the switch
or tighten it up
often it needs to be replaced I have a video on that
second most often problem with
washing machines often goes undetected
something you'd probably want to check
regularly is that your aggitator
dogs are working properly
what it should do is turn the bottom
one-way or the other so
this one is turning it like it should
and the aggitator dogs are functioning now if it's 
not doing that than your clothes are just getting rinsed
they are not really getting washed
it is an often missed
problem with washing machines
and its probably very common because
the agitator dogs inside here are 
designed to break if someone's arm was
to get stuck in here or if something
was to bind up tu much the aggitator dogs will actually strip on purpose as a safety mechanism
third most common problem with washing
machines is
a clogged pump
at the impeller
sometimes a penny or a button or
something else, a bobby pin
whatever goes down the drain line and
gets stuck at the pump. Fourth most common 
problem
is a leak. Most often leaks occur
up on the left side. Fifth most common
problem is a washing machine out of
balance. Now the most often cause of the machine
being out of balance
is just a matter of redistributing
the clothes. Usually a towel or
something gets on one side and you hear the whump whump whump whump of
the machine
what you need to do is open the lid
and than go ahead and readjust the 
clothing or go ahead and readjust the towel
uh... readjust the items in the bin to
get a more balanced
and then go ahead and run it again see if it
works out and you have no more
out of balance deal sometimes you could lose a spring most often times it's just that the
machines out of balance
eventually I'll have to make you a video showing you how to reset the spring
if it did come off
there is three different shocks and then
there is a spring
that holds the machine basin in place
now the way to check if your machine is
still in balance is just ahead and run it
empty with water
let the  water fill up
if the machine finds its balance than you know it
was just a matter of the clothes
or the laundry items
being out of balance
anyway that is the five most common problems
with washing machines
