hey guys and welcome to episode 8 of
baking with Q today I'm going to show
you how to roll out homemade font you
will need one homemade fondant of a
stupid that I showed you how to make
yesterday
firstly you're going to want to take it
and knead it back until it gets nice and
soft and pliable because
if you made it yesterday like me it will
be all hard
just want to keep rolling it kneading it
until it's nice and
smooth
so now it's nice and smooth and you're
just going to want to keep
rolling it and pushing down
on one side until it gets all
the creases out of here
and all nice and smooth
so now it's all nice and smooth and what
you're going to want to do is you're
going to want to lay it down like this
and you just want to take your hand put
it on top and twist it
if you know what it's like it's the
bottom nice and smooth
and you're going to want to put the
other side down and get doing that again
after you've done that I'll show you how
to roll it out you're gonna need your
rolling pin
and you're just going to want to roll it
out do not go over the side if you go
over the side
this will happen it'll be all uneven
this side will be nice and thin but this
side will be very thick and that's not
what you want
so then you'd have to re get it back and
nice and smooth
so now I'm going to show you how to roll
that fondant the right way
so now what you're going to do is you're
going to
just roll from the middle out
well
and then after you start rolling on one
side you're going to want to flip it
over
and turn it
okay you're going to want to do that
again you're going to want to flip it
over
and then turn it
what you're gonna what you want is a
quarter of an inch thickness or even
thinner if you can
foreign
so now you're going to want to flip it
over
and then you're going to want to rotate
it
so
if you start out with a circle when
you're rolling it it's like it's easier
gonna be to get it to look like a circle
when it's done
[Applause]
starting to get there
if you notice it's getting very thin
so just keep rolling it
I also want to show you how thin it gets
before it rips
actually see-through before it rips so
also you want to do this on your fondant
map if you don't have that make sure
you're doing it on a non-stick surface
or it will stick to your surface and you
won't get a nice
smooth fondant it'll just make a mess
and that's not what you want
so if you notice it's starting to get
see-through here
once you get to the end you can start
going over the sides a little bit just
to make sure they get all thin
notice it's starting to get see-through
by the way most of my the brand I use is
the Wilton brand
for like
um my fondant mat
but my rubber spatula I get at the
dollar store
now may want to see a rolling pin if it
does
now watch this
you can still pick it up
and it won't rip
if you handle it correctly it won't rip
it's kind of like pizza dough
and that is how
to get your fondant see-through
now I'm going to show you how to make it
nice and
just thin good size for good thickness
for covering a cake so you're just going
to smooth it up again
and then make a nice flat bottom again
once you do that
you're just going to want to roll it out
again so start in the middle and just go
back and forth over it and then lift
take that off and
flip it over and then rotate it
[Applause]
I want to do that again so flip it over
and then rotate it
and don't go over the edge like I said
before
if you go over your Edge and look at it
all uneven
[Applause]
and that's how to roll out your fondant
you want at least a quarter of an inch
thickness you can get it even thinner
then that's perfect
