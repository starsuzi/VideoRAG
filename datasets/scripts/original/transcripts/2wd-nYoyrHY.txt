informative of you know how to do it you

[Music]
YouTube what's happening
the little bro is gonna shoot this video
for me so I'm going to talk loud and
hope to god suits you guys can hear me
so we're going to do today how to shift
an 18-speed
most transmissions out there or that I
know of that I've driven 10 speed 13 and
18 an 18-speed the only difference
between 18 speed and a 13 speed is an 18
speed you can split all the gears on the
low side and the high side on a 13 speed
you can only split the gears on the high
side easy way to tail is can you see
this great splitter yep on an 18 speed
the splitter on the side that splits the
actual gear will be great
and the splitter on the 13 speed will be
red of course we all have our high-low
splitters in the front high range
leverage so we're getting heavy so we'll
go ahead and show you all all the gears
if you wondered how do you get 18 gears
out of this good zoom in on this thing
you can see where it says high low
reverse low high 1 5 6 2 7 3 & 8 4
18th speed basically your low range
which is one and then you can split it
and so on and so forth so we have one
two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
and you come up and over 11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18
let's go ahead and get out here I'm
gonna go through all the gears for you
are you can zoom out next you can get a
whole view of it
right now we're in Lolo
really unless you're really really heavy
you're pulling oversize you're you're
over 80,000 I don't really see the need
to split the low range but for video
purposes we're gonna do it
you take off
the way that you should live to gear I'm
gonna get around
we split it up to the high side you let
off the gas
you get right back in it you let off
it'll shift
you get back in it here in the high side
now we will shift up so we bring the
splitter back down
we go up there's third
put it up on the high side
back down
there's myth
basically we're in the bit here right
here
they're six
come back down
go up to the far right they're standing
let it up there's a
bring it back down let off the gas
there's nice
we're gonna stop we got a red light here
and then you split that up and of course
that's in ten are you guys a ball single
oh right
this is what I do even when I'm happy
I'm 76,000 and we're just take off on
the low side
and I just stay on the low side
there's no need to split these lowered
ears
shut up 7870 east
[Music]
unless you're well over 80 pounds
because it's just a real real look
some would say it's overkill for a
drive-in there's no such thing
find the gear this
this warrior would move but he ain't
gonna
we have to stop
these things these 18 speeds in these
Pete's man they just shift like butter
now we're on the high side there's
litter back
there's 10th year
so I got it split up I let off the
throttle it shifts I get right back in
it
now I'm going to go from 11 to 12 so I'm
going to bring the splitter down I'm in
the throttle let off to shift down back
in the throttle
go back up on the high side off the
throttle these shifts back in the truck
now say you wanted to downshift and get
up here
there's two ways to downshift 18-speed
and I'll show you here a big hole
because how great this thing boss 80,000
pounds of super Aria don't want to
Pinkie Pie head to sixty miles an hour
can't ask for much better now alright so
here we are we're in the big hole on the
low side obviously we click it up and we
get sled to the high Sun now if you just
look back down there's two ways to do it
you can pull this splitter down let off
the throttle let it come out of here and
they give a guess now if y'all hurt that
that kind of that grinding noise
that's our guarantor
there is a way to do it well no no
you shift it up now you're on the high
side in a big hole I mean you want to
doubt you
okay come out of the gear split it back
out get back into the guest
two ways to do it
the other
that's the way they do it either way you
just let it get out get back in it's
quicker and do it that way I think
if you don't want to you don't have
that's all I got for me
[Music]
you never had too much gear I knew the
date
we have anything else it just helps you
any kind of condition you're in you can
and the gear you need to be in so thanks
