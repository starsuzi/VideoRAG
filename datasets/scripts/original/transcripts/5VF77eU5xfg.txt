okay what I want to show you is fiddle
stick for care and cleaning in general
this isn't an actual fiddle stick it's a
slightly different shape but it's still
lexan polycarbonate approximately the
same dimensions uh you should really
never need to clean them or do anything
with them if you decide to soap and
water or just water and rinse it off uh
in general just keep harsh chemicals
away from these let me explain why um
one of the chemicals that reacts badly
with lexan or polycarbonate is acetone
so first off let me show you how strong
this is without
it and I'm pretty much standing and
bouncing on that between two 2x4s as you
can see
it's really strong there and something
happens to it when you hit hit it with
acetone that is uh not very
comfortable just going to keep this to
keep my uh hands away from
it so as you can see I can push really
hard
and go nuts on this if I just put a
little downward pressure oh 5 10 lbs
this is acetone just pour some acetone
on
there snaps clean in
half you can see that's not something
you want to do is have acetone near this
uh something I did want to let everybody
know though also is if you douse this in
acetone this is another stick exactly
the same this is also now just as weak
as that one was with acetone on it but
if you let this completely dry
off let's get all this dried out you'll
notice a bunch of discoloration it's all
plasticky and uh cloudy you've done some
damage there but once it's all
completely dried
out it's back to being strong again
although I wouldn't crust
it so the acetone pretty much has to be
reacting with it right at the
moment it's pretty
much back to strong again so no acetone
anything just keep all harsh chemicals
away from your fiddle stick in general
soap and water if you want to do
anything to it at all that uh hopefully
helps
