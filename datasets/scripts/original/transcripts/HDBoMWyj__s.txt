hey everybody thanks for stopping in
today I'm going to cook some salmon and
even though I only live about 45 minutes
from the Pacific coast this is Atlantic
salmon but not only that it's imported
from
Chile anyway let's get cooking here all
right so here's my salmon I bought this
yesterday it's about a pound a third and
I really probably should have cooked it
yesterday but I really wasn't in the
mood to make a video that's one thing
when you buy fish try to cook it as soon
as you can cuz I've had it go bad on me
and it usually tastes better the sooner
you cook it so let me get that rinsed
off and I'm going to cook it on my cast
iron griddle the fish is all rinsed off
now I guess I should cut it into some
smaller pieces I got myself a new
utility knife yesterday so I get to try
it out it's a
wof uh 6in utility knife so
let's try cutting a few pieces of this
salmon
[Music]
here nice went right through
[Music]
it now I'm going to put some olive oil
on both sides of the salmon and mainly
this is just to keep it from sticking to
the grill and I did take a paper towel
and rub a little oil on the grill as
well I bought something new to try a few
days ago it's called Himalayan pink salt
I've seen a few other people on YouTube
uh using this and basically it's
unprocessed and you have to grind
it and it's supposed to have a lot of
trace minerals in it supposed to be good
for you as far as the taste it just
taste like salt pretty much so that's
all I'm going to season that side with
right now I'm not going to put anything
on the skin side and uh soon as my grill
is warmed up over here we'll get them on
there I haven't cooked any fish on this
side of this griddle before so I'm
trying to figure out the best way to lay
it on there I guess I'll just uh go
ahead and just lay it on there just like
that
and I know probably take about 5 minutes
to cook on that side or
so and then we'll come back and flip
it okay it's been about 5 minutes on
that side the house is smoking up pretty
bad here see if I can flip these without
them coming apart on
[Music]
me hey that looks pretty good
[Music]
these are looking good now I'm going to
season these a little more with a little
bit of dill weed the reason I didn't put
that on first is because if it gets too
hot it kind of burns so I just put it on
now all right a little
that and uh I think I'll put just a
little bit of Pepper too oo kind of a
lot I'll put Pepper on two I'll leave no
pepper on one for my
wife okay it's been about 10 minutes
total I'm going to shut that off right
there I think they're probably done cast
iron holds the heat anyway and we'll get
them off of there and see how they look
[Music]
well it looks like this turned out
pretty good I have a nice fresh Meer
lemon I picked off the lemon tree
outside so squeeze some of that on
there I think this ought to be pretty
dang
good okay let's stick a fork in it oh
look at that juicy moist let's take a
bite that is it excellent and you know
you do get kind of a smoky grilled
flavor from that cast iron grill I'm
starting to really like this thing
probably be using it some more thanks
for watching you guys and I'll talk to
you next time
