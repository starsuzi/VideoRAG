mix and uh so there you know there there
wasn't any forign
material uh added at all but you can see
right
here you can see right here see these
little
weeds uh they got in there somehow and I

but it ain't no problem you just pull
them up like
that yeah you're going to have a few
weeds
I'm going to show you some
more uh this other area right over here
this melon box I call it it's got uh you
know it's got weeds in it too over right
there on the back side there's a bunch
of mushrooms but I planted some more
onions in
this this box right here there's a
little
snail little snail trying to get one of
my little little onion thing thanks sets
little
turd about to plant that little dude
right back down in
there something like
that it like to got washed away
yesterday man it I'm going to tell you
something I've seen some pretty big rain
in my life but the one we got
yesterday it was uh it was
bad I've never seen it rain that much
that
quick but got flooded out out these uh
this first half right here um all the
way to right here you know from from
here to here is sets and then I went and
bought some seed uh
for what's commonly called the uh velia
onions and uh planted them right here
yesterday uh in the rain you can see
where some of the holes
are but I got to refill this thing after
these onions get
done and
uh I'm GNA grow tomatoes here next to
but yeah man we got we got weeds in here
too uh I don't know what kind of weed
that is but boy they they're showing up
everywhere
everywhere no don't eat that
you you feel like screaming watch it
it's hard for me to do
anything with her
around you better watch
it you better watch
it okay here one of those uh
Mimosa little beans I call them uh them
little little seeds right in here
they'll get into my bed and all a sudden
you got little trees popping up boy I
had to keep my eye on them cuz
they'll get out of hand real quick I
want them their roots to go down and
penetrate the landscaping
fabric in the bottom that would be
bad I'm this video is getting pretty
long but I'm I'm I'm going to show you
this right
here there's a 18 gallon SE water
container I made last year and uh this
thing right here it's a
this is my six yeah 16
gallon a
bucket and I'm going to fix it up uh
probably make a self watering container
out of it I
guess and uh I'm going to grow something
in it I'm
probably probably going to grow my
honeydew melons in these two things
right here I'm not going to get carried
away next year and grow all kinds of
crazy stuff uh I may or may not do
pumpkins I'm not sure they just uh take
Pi up a lot of room man and they choked
everything else out so I'm probably
going to do honeydew melons in both of
these against this trus right here and
probably
uh um probably won't grow any
pumpkins these uh blackberries that
transplanted last winter they man they
doing it I mean they shoot man they grow
pretty good uh really don't know what
I'll do with them
uh may may pull them out later I don't
know it's
just it's just
according anyway that's going to be
plenty long enough right there
