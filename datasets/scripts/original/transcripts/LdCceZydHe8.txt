I'm going to show you how to make a pav
Loa perfectly for this recipe I'm using
three large egg whites and 2/3 cup of
castor sugar and half a teaspoon of
white vinegar and half a teaspoon of
vanilla and you will
need a tray with a foil on it first
Grease the foil then onto the foil add
some corn flour and discard the rest and
uh leave it uh 18 cm circle like
this when you are working with egg
whites The Mixing Bowl has to be very
clean so add the egg whites into the
mixing
bowl while mixing the egg whes add the
sugar little by little
when the morang is little stiff add the
vinegar and the vanilla and waat until
it
combines when the morang is stiff like
this put that onto the
foil
and build it to the
top after spreading the Moran on the
foil like this use a spatula and put it
onto the top like
this
slowly and make grooves like this around
the edges of the pav Loa that will
prevent breaking it while baking like
this and flatten the top
properly when you work with paoa the
secret is if you put if you flatten and
uh neatly flatten the surface it will
break so just put the like this make
Groves
and do it like this all the
time so build it up to the top and
flatten the surface and bake it on 10 s
120 or 100 c fan for about 1 and 1/2
hours after baking the pan over about 1
and/ half hours switch off the oven and
leave it in the oven leaving the door a
little
open the Pavo is ready to check whether
the Pavo is all right just
uh knock it on top and it gives a Hol
sound and to serve this add lots of
fresh fruit on top and serve with
whipped cream and I hope you will enjoy
