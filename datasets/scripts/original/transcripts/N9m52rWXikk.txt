another day another AliExpress
item it smells a little bit like green
tea good on them pretty lightweight this
bit's the heaviest bit makes a horrible
sound when you do it up
quickly it's not as bad if you hold it
up whilst you're putting it
in I think it'd be totally avoidable if
it was wet
doesn't taste like green
tea yeah that works
nicely I can't squeeze it hard enough to
Dent it but I think if I
bash yeah slight D so like almost
everything that exists if you bash it
really hard it's going to get dented
very good bottle this I quite like it
so this was only because I didn't do it
up tight enough once it's uptight
[Music]
enough it's all good on the whole very
good bottle nice size here's an iPhone
it can contain
about it's a lightweight Alan stainless
steel water bottle and they come in five
different sizes of few to choose from
but only this color bambo at the top
pretty nice
