hey guys so today I have a spring DIY
for you and today I'm going to show you
how to make a pressed flower bookmark I
hope that you enjoy it this is not hard
to make but it's very beautiful and it
will make a great gift for
somebody so you will need flowers of
different shapes and colors and I just
went in my backyard and I found this uh
tiny bitty flowers they don't have to be
thick make sure they're
thin then you will need colored paper or
just white paper a pen or a Sharpie tape
and scissors that's
all so first you're going to cut a piece
of paper as wide as the
tape then you're going to take your pen
or your Sharpie and you're just going to
write um a code or a Bible verse or just
anything you want to write
so I'm going to put this aside and I'm
going to start working on my
bookmark so now you're just going to
take a longer piece of a tape and U put
it on the table and make sure that the
sticky side is facing
up then you're just going to need
something heavy to put on top of it so
the tape doesn't move
so now you're just going to take your
flowers and press them down on the
tank and just make sure that your
flowers are not too thick because if
they are you're not going to be able to
make it
work so you can pretty much play with it
and arrange them in different order and
you can use smaller flowers and bigger
flowers whatever you like you can also
use leaves um maybe unique shapes and
colors whatever you find in your garden
or in your
Park so now I'm going to take the paper
that I wrote the message on or the coat
and I'm just going to cut it so it fits
uh the
tape and just add it to the tape with
the message facing
down so now I just cut the tape and I
decided to add more flowers to it so it
will be more
pretty and this is how my design looks
so far
and it's not ready yet we have one more
step so now this is probably going to be
the hardest uh part of making this and
now you're just going to take another
long piece of tape and you are going to
have to put it on top of it but you have
to be really
careful because it's really easy to mess
it up
and I was saying that your flowers have
to be thin because if they're going to
be thick the tape on top is not going to
stick to it so now you're just going to
cut the excess uh tape from both sides
and you're
done and this is how my pressed flower
book Mark
looks I hope that you guys enjoyed this
