Hi Welcome to Saras Kitchen
Today my video
is about how to grow beet root leaves from the cuts
usually we can the use the bottom
portion of the beet root and trash the top portion
Today  I am going to show how to use
the top portion and regrow the beetroot leaves.
Let see how to do it
cut the top portion of
the beet root leaving 1/2 inch
Fill water in a tray or a cup and place the cut portion
into the water
keep the tray in a sunny spot
you can also grow beet leaves in coconut shell
fill with water and small tray filled potting soil
if you want to grow beet root
leaves in water you need to change the water
in every two day to control the bacterial
growth so for my convince  I transfer the beets
into the grow bag filled with potting soil
you can also grow beets directly in to the grow bag
don't keep the grow bag  in direct
sunlight and sprinkle some water on top of the beet daily
this is the second week you can the
see the leaves are coming up
now we are in the fourth week see the size and colour of the beet leaves
If you  harvest the bigger leaves the small leaves will shoot up
for taking video purpose I will not harvest the leaves
you can harvest now and then and used in salads , soups and milk shakes
you can see the small shoots are coming up
without much care and minimal maintenance you can grow in a small tray also
to maintain the space I transfer all the beets in a single grow bag
now its time to harvest the leaves
don't  pluck or pull the leaves gently cut the leaves with the help of the scissors
and the leaves will regrow again
