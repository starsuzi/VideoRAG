this is dried Stevia that I had hanging
um by my window over the winter and now
it is completely dry you can hear
it so I'm going to try to take all the
leaves out put it in this bag and see
how it tastes used as a sweetener for
teas and other hot beverages I got it
all in a bag so now I think I'm just
going to try to crush it in the bag
B to make it more into a
powder so it's pretty well crushed not
completely but pretty good I'm going to
put it in this
tupperw here's what the stevia looks
like and it's not as powdery as I
thought I can make it I guess I could
put it in a blender but let me see if I
can just use this to steep some tea I
have some mint that I harvested from the
garden and it was
dried so going to put
that in
there
then
maybe a
pinch of the
stevia I have some hot
[Music]
water
it's been about 3 minutes 5 minutes just
going
to see how everything
tastes
so there's the
tea see how it tastes oh it's really
good I actually thought I wouldn't like
it when you eat the stevia leaves it has
this really weird aftertaste but when
you use it like this um it's the
sweetness is very subtle and you don't
get that weird aspar tame like
aftertaste it's really
good
