Welcome all!  Papa G here.  Today I present
a tasty little treat that's very easy to
make.  My low carbohydrate coconut candy.  With just
the right amount of sweetness and only
one net carbohydrate per serving, it's the
perfect snack to help keep your macros
in check, without sacrificing flavor. 
Let's get started...
We'll begin with the main ingredient of our candy - coconut butter.  This is simply pureed coconut.
We'll be using the entire jar, which is
about a cup and a half.  We'll need to
melt the coconut butter into a liquid
form.  Do so by placing the coconut butter
into a microwave-safe bowl and
microwaving for about 60 seconds.  In a
large mixing bowl, add the melted coconut
butter; one third of a cup of melted coconut
oil; and give a mix to incorporate.  We'll
add some flavor with one tablespoon of
vanilla extract and a bit of salt.  Give
that another mix.  We'll sweeten with a
liquid sugar substitute equal to a half a
cup of regular sugar.  For texture and a
little more flavor, add one cup of
slivered almonds.  Mix thoroughly until
combined.  Line an 8 by 8 inch baking pan
with parchment paper and pour the
coconut mixture into the center.  Give a
shake and a jiggle to spread the mixture
as evenly as possible.  Place in the
freezer for 20 to 30 minutes to set.
When set, remove from the pan and place on
a cutting surface. With a sharp knife, cut
into 32 pieces and enjoy a great taste
of coconutty goodness.
