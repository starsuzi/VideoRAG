today I'm going to be showing you a
petroleum based fire started with pet
petroleum jelly and cotton balls it
lights easy and it burns for a long time
and you're going to want to use a cheap
pie that you're not going to eat out of
again petroleum jelly and cotton
balls you're going to want to put it on
a low heat because all you want to do is
melt it
Che
and if y'all are wondering what that
noise is that is Nanny's cat named Miss
Kitty and we'll show you her later and
yeah she's really
cute and
bad and you're just going to want to
watch it watch it until it melts down
and turns into a liquid
as soon as it's turned into a
liquid you're going to want to pour it
into your cotton
balls go
[Music]
you want to make sure the cotton balls
are full of
petroleum
and you want to make a let them sit
until they dry back up
[Music]
you kind of have to fluff up the cotton
balls a little bit to light it to where
it looks from this to
that and then
[Music]
see it lights with just a spark
it's pretty
cool and even in the rain and rain and
the wind it's still burning
yeah that works really well it's a
strong wind out here and it's
drizzling you'd have plenty time to get
your kindling around that and get it
burning
I wonder if you can move it
you actually had enough time to go get
candling come back and put it on this
fire and it's still going
I'm surprised how well it's doing in
this really strong wind and
drizzle I'll have to check the time on
it our Fritos might have burned longer
but this burned a lot stronger and the
Fritos didn't have any wind no they had
no wind and this actually caught with a
spark the Fritos were kind of hard to
[Music]
light well there goes the top
[Music]
[Music]
and it is officially out
it burned for about 6 minutes in the
wind and the rain and it's a good thing
to Pat in your camping survival bag
