hello everybody.welcome a commute video
I have to crouch down it will stand up
tall you can't see my face
so in today's view don't on background
noise I'm going to show you how to clean
I'm gonna be showing you how to clean
your lettuce out and I'm your mine's got
quite a little problem because mine mine
gets worn down quite easily and I've got
dunlop showjumping this weekend so like
I wanted to look nice and clean the
first thing that you will need is some
leather balm and you'll also need a sock
this is what you're going to be using to
clean your leather cleaning conditioner
and it also sort of water person a
trusty stuff or at least some sort of or
rag something that you don't mind
getting super duper oily um I just use
old socks
may as well recycle you can use tissues
and rags and stuff but socks are really
easy because they're like a glove so you
can run it and get in all the nooks and
crannies and stuff so yes let's get
started first thing I'll do is take off
your stirrups and start loaders
[Music]
Wow this side is even worse than the
other side look how many rubs they're on
the world here and there this big one
there
these will Rob's on the seats as well
freeway and I do although this settle
quite often not every rider anything but
I don't like never oiler it just gets
really badly damaged but it's a good
saddle just as easily so now you've
taken your stirrups off so you can see
it's like a bomb and so you're just
gonna put a little bit on the end of
whatever using whether it be a rag or a
cloth or a salt just put a little bit on
the end you don't need much
I need to sort of massage it into the
saddle and spread it out a lot
so you're gonna do all of the subtle
like under the sweat flaps and in
between boy notes and crannies just do
the whole entire saddle
[Music]
also do you the the built straps
you can view them as well because these
often get quite cracked so you can do
these so just put some of the bomb um
whatever you using and then you just
slide it down
[Music]
so yeah that's how you clean a little
subtle as you can see it's a nice shiny
can't see the rubs as much and the bowls
of does water proof to settle a little
bit so I think it's rained on it's not
going to get a stack you guys love the
subtle IP enjoy this video subscribe for
