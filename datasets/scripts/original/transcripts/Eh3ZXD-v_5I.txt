hi I'm D with modesty matters we're a
business dedicated to providing products
for modest minded families today I'm
going to show you how to make our
Boutique pillowcase dress the first
thing you're going to need to do is
print off or take out your
pattern your
instructions and you're going to need
some you also need your primary fabric
your accent Fabric or your ruffle and 60
in in of 7/8 width groan ribbon okay now
our patterns are numbered so that you
can assemble
them I am making the extra small so we
only need the first four 1 2 3 four
sections of our
pattern now what you do is you line it
up so that you can see
underneath for instance I see the
modesty matter.net
and I can line it up
just like
this I'm going to tape it in
place they're all going to
overlap there we go now it takes a
little bit of work up front but you're
going to have a pattern that's so much
more sturdy than any tissue paper
pattern and it'll last for so much
longer you may want to tape on the back
also
and there it is that wasn't
bad now we're just simply going to cut
our pattern out and prepare to use it on
our
fabric all right now here's our pattern
all cut out and ready I want to point
out some things about our material now
this material is directional meaning
that our flowers all point up so we want
to be mindful of that as we're laying
our pattern out
another thing I have our fold right here
toward me and way over here is our
Salvage you want to stay away from the
Salvage you don't want that in your
dress what we're going to do is
fold this
over and we needed the width of our
dress have it lined up with the width of
our dress okay so we're going to have a
fold on on this side and we're going to
have a fold on this side okay now
because of the way we folded this our
material is four layers thick that we're
laying this on we have a single fold
over here and then we have a double fold
over
here all right now that we have our
pattern piece pinned in place I want to
point out we're going to cut right along
here and right along here
but as we cut this line be so careful
not to cut this top fold we're just
going to cut this material right under
here just along
there as I mentioned we're going to be
very careful cutting along here that we
don't cut that folded
material okay once we open it up this is
what it looks like all right now we're
going to set this material
aside and we're going to cut out our
ruffle our Salvage is over here and our
fold is over here and I'm simply going
to double that over again take a
ruler and this is the simplest way to do
it to measure off your 3
in and then take a pencil and a ruler
and just simply mark it
off and then go back and cut it now
we're going to need two strips EX
exactly like this 3 in
wide I want to show you I have both of
our 3in
strips I'm going to pin them at this
end and I'm going to take them to the
machine I'm going to do a straight
Stitch right across here at 5/8 in and
come back into a zigzag to finish that
seam as you look at the sewing machine
you're going to see right up here it
says 5/8 that's what I'm talking about
when I say 5/8 in seam allowance most of
the time you're sewing for yourself
you're going to line up the edge of your
material with that line I put down a
presser foot and then I come over here
to the knob turn it and that puts our
needle down this is needle down position
and that's how we're going to start all
our
seams I'm going to go
forward I stop and I'm going to go in
reverse and in doing that that locks
that stitch in play so we have a nice
secure
beginning and ending the same thing at
the end beginning and at the end now
what I'm going to
do is go back and zigzag the very edge
so that we don't have any
frame we have stitched our two strips
together we're going to hem what's going
to be the bottom of our ruffle to do
that we're going to take it to the
ironing board and I'm going to measure
out about a/4 of an
inch what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to do a rolled hem so I roll it up
about a/ quart of an
inch press
that roll it again over
itself and press that again
and then I pin that in
place I'm going to do that all the way
across the strip all right now I'm going
to hem along the bottom of our ruffle
I'm using a straight Stitch and I'm just
going to go right along this crease that
we made here all the way down starting a
needle down position
I want to point out to you this is a
good position to have your hands in when
you're
sewing just one hand over here and one
hand here to study the
[Music]
fabric there we have our scene
what we're going to do now is gather our
ruffle and we're going to use the needle
and thread method I've got my needle
here and I've got my thread doubled over
and well knotted at the very
end what I'm going to do is take this
raw edge of this ruffle up
here and I'm going
to put my needle in bring it back out
and I'm just going to keep feeding that
material onto my needle just like this
and every once in a while I'll pull it
through now it's okay if your stitches
are not perfectly even at this point
because we're going to pull this out
later
anyway so I just go along here and I
just feed that material onto that
needle here we have our ruffle and I've
gathered our edge with our needle and
thread method and you can see how much
control we have of that I love that
method it's a great way to
start now here's our primary
material and I'm going to lay that out
just like
this then I'm going to take our
ruffle and I'm going to turn it so we
have basically right sides together the
side of the material that we want to see
and the side of the ruffle that we want
to see are going to be together
now I'm going to pin this to the edge
okay now I've pinned this to the edge
right here I'm going to come all the way
over here to the other
Edge and I'm going to pin it there as
well I'm going to find the middle of our
dress which of course is easy because
there's a crease there and the middle of
our ruffle
and I'm going to pin
that now what that does is that just
gives us a visual guideline of where we
want to
pull and put our Ruffles and our
gathers so we're going to evenly space
those along
here we're going to pin right in the
middle that'll help us
and right in the middle over here as
well now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take this to the machine now
and I'm going to straight Stitch at 5/8
in right along here stopping as I go I'm
going to be adjusting these gathers in
place so we have it nice and even when
I'm all done with that I'm going to clip
this thread and just pull it out so
let's go to the
machine right needle down
position start
reverse and then we're going to go nice
and slowly making sure that our gathers
are going to be
even for
now we're going to go back and we're
going to clip this basting thread and
we're going to pull it right out of here
now I'm going to zigzag the edge here
just to prevent any fraying
okay we're almost done with our sweet
little ruffle I'm bringing it back to
the ironing board and I'm going to iron
it up this ledge right here pointing
up I'm going to bring it over then and
I'm going to press it on the other side
as
well the next thing I'm going to do is
called top
stitching and what I mean by that is I'm
going to take this back to the machine
and I'm going to do a straight Stitch
right along here that's going to secure
this in place and keep it from folding
back down while the child is wearing it
just one straight Stitch all the way
along
here what I'm doing is I've Lin
my primary fabric right here this seam
right here I've lined it up with the4 in
Mark right up here and I'm going to sew
a straight Stitch all the way along
lining that
up all right now as you can see I top
Stitch this right along here to secure
that in place you are done with your
ruffle now but let me point out another
option for you if you don't want to do a
ruffle you can take eyelet like
this and put along here
instead you would do the same thing as
far as turning it this way stitching it
in place turning it back over and top
stitching
so you do the same thing you would just
have your bottom hem done for you and
you would have the Gathering done for
you and that's a very Charming look also
all right with our ruffle done we are
going to do our side seam remember we
only have one side
seam what we're going to do is take this
seam right here and line it up we want
to pin that in place because we want to
get that one right
and we're going to pin right along the
edge
here right on
up now we're going to take this to the
machine and we're going to straight
Stitch at 5/8 in here we are lined up
with our 5/8 in Mark and I start forward
and I reverse
I go all the way up that
seam all right now that I've completed
my Straight Stitch all the way along
here I'm going to go back and I'm going
to do the zigzag Stitch to keep this
from fraying right along the raw edge
here
now that I've done our straight Stitch
and our zigzag stitch on our one seam
I'm going to iron it all over to one
side and it's always a good idea to iron
your
seams now with our right sides together
what I'm going to do is come all the way
along our top Raw edges here and do
what's called a rolled hem just like we
did on the bottom I'm going to go like
this I'm going to iron it in place I'm
going to roll it again on
itself iron that in place and I'm going
to pin it I'm going to do that all the
way around our top all right girls and
ladies I have rolled and pressed this
and pinned it in place all along here
the underarm first then I came back and
I went along the top and I rolled it and
pressed it in place about A4 of an
inch then I pinned it I'm going to take
this to the machine now and I'm going to
go all the way along the edge with a
straight Stitch securing this down all
the way around all right starting in the
needle down
position I'm going to go forward in
reverse and I'm going to go all the way
around this
Edge nice and slowly so we always catch
it
all right now that you've gone around
the armhole I'm going to show you how to
Pivot when you come to a corner you're
going to come straight up to that corner
just like this and I'm going to raise
the presser foot and I'm going to Pivot
my material now note that I have my
needle down you have to keep your needle
down for this to work then I'm going to
start
again and there we have it we've
finished our top Edge what we're going
to do now is take our slide ruler and
put it at one and 1/4
in right there and we're going to fold
down this top edge
here and this is going to be our
casing for our
ribbon going to fold it
down press it in place and pin
it and we're going to do the exact same
thing on the other side all right now
that we have measured pressed and pinned
we're going to take this to the machine
and we're going to do a straight Stitch
right over the top of this straight
Stitch right here and that's going to
form the casing for our ribbon
[Music]
all right girls and Ladies we have
finished our casing now for our
ribbon on both
sides now you need to take your Ribbon
cut it in equal lengths so that's 30 in
long and we're going to take our liquid
fabric sealant and put it right along
the edge of both of these sides and
that's going to keep those from fraying
and making a mess and I'm going to take
a
pencil and I'm going to fold this over
just like this holding it in place and
I'm going to push that through our
casing such an easy easy
way to put our ribbon through the
casing pulling that out the other
side there we have it
beautiful do the same thing on the other
side and now I'm going to turn it so
that you can see our beautiful
pillowcase
dress so sweet
and here it is our Boutique pillowcase
dress it is such a sweet little jumper
