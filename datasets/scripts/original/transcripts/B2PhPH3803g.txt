famous grilling techniques known to
man this is going to be amazing what
we're going to do is create a very
simple rub put the chicken on the
rotisserie and let the saber Grill work
its magic for about an hour and 15
minutes an hour and 20 minutes so the
first thing we'll do is put together our
rub we've got brown
sugar salt pepper
and a combination of chili powder and
paprika going to combine all that this
is a very simple
rub almost anything could be added to
this garlic onion cilantro
cumin but what this is going to do is
give us a beautiful beautiful color and
really extract some of that beautiful
flavor out of the chicken now before we
put the chicken onto the rotisserie
I want to truss it or I want to make it
nice and tight so that it'll cook
beautifully and evenly so to do that

string we're going to come
down Circle the

the chicken parcel as compact as
possible so that while it's on the
rotisserie it Cooks nice and
