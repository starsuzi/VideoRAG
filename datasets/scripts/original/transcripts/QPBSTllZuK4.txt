all right guys I'm about to show you how
to let your window up or down sometimes
your window your actual um your your
window switch make break on this car
there just one screw that's inside of
here that I'm going to take
out you'll see your screw just wherever
you got to disconnect to get to this
one once I take that screw out I can
pull this loose and this right here is
actually your window power this is what
controls your window up and down so for
this
one I'm just going to pop this out now
this right here is what I can use now to
let my window go up and down just in
case my switch goes out now I'm going to
show you how to do it first thing you
want to do is have your car turn forward
not on but turn to where you can get
power to
should you'll hear your cars turned
forward the next thing I'm going to use
is like these
little wires right here I'm just going
to use the jump it with you're going to
have to figure out if you look closely
inside of here you'll see there little
metal basically like little metal things
inside of some of the holes you got two
on this side and you got four over here
you just have to figure out which wire
goes into which one and then jump to the
other side so what I'm going to do first
is I have to use two wires for this I'll
stick this wire to let my window
down I'm going to stick this one in the
first
slot then I'll take this piece of
wire you may see a couple Sparks on time
if you get it wrong but don't worry
about it it's not going to damage
anything it just be a little spark
telling you that the that basically you
you got power run to
power so I wouldn't worry about that and
once you get that then I'm going to take
the other wire on here and I'll run it
from the second one on this
one till probably
around I'mma try the last one first
I got to make sure I have these in
here got to have that
connection so now I'm going
try to
do this
connection and this last
one see that made my window go down so I
did the second second one on this side
and the last one over there made my
window go down now to let my window back
up what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take in on my car cars are different so
you got to figure out on yours which one
to let it up which one to let it down so
what I'm going to try to let mine up is
since I know
now there's the wires since I know now
I'mma try the first slot and then the
slot
basically right next to
it get the wires in
there I have that one like that and
then I'mma try this bottom one on my I
said you once again you have to work
with yours to figure out which ones work
and then
this I'mma do hold on let me get this
try this
one
and get this
wi and as you have it you see the
windows going up with those two so what
I would suggest you do is once you have
to do this one time get you like a piece
of paper and write down which one does
what for your vehicle for mine I know
now the first two slots jumper wire and
then the two bottom ones will let my
window up and then I also know that the
first and the last slot and then the
second and the bottom slot will let my
window down but this is how you would
actually make your window go up or down
just in case your switch ever goes out
thanks
