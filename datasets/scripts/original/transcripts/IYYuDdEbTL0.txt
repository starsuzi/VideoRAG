first I like to tap the filter
out to get any of
the dirt particles out and then I like
to go through with a
brush soft
brush and get all the little bug
particles
out and sticks that get stuck in between
the
pleat S&B uh step one cleaner
cleanser like to apply a generous amount
of this in here so it soaks into the oil
real
good breaks up that dirt and
[Music]
oil SM smb's instructions tell you just
do the dirty side of the filter um what
I like to do is I like to do the entire
filter as the instructions do on this I
like to get a little bit on the
inside here I just spray a little bit
down in there this will help break up
the oil that's soaked through the pleat
on the back side as
well and then we just simply let this
sit for 10 to 15 minutes
now that 15 minutes has passed
up let get
in not using a pressurized
nozzle make sure
get in and clean and all the old oil
come
out all the
dirt I go over with this one more time
and make sure I got all the little bugs
out I might have been dis and sticks and
what have you by the
water and that's
it I let it sit for a few minutes let
the water Wick out of it and uh then I
tap it
shake
it get some of the excess water
out let it sit in the Sun for a
day well this have been sitting outside
all day in the
sun like to give it a shake make sure we
don't get any more water out of
it feel the inside make sure it's all
dry
outside and uh looks like it's ready to
go next step is to oil it
up I use the SMB ad uh SMB
applicator that is about 20
G we want to start at the pleats
where they meet the rubber or the
urethan sure we're want to hit both
sides
so as you can see it's about 20 G so we
used just about half of it just on the
corner of
each so now we want to go
through want to oil along the
top for
but you want to make
sure the most important thing
thing is that it's all
consistent you want to look around for
little white
spots or inconsistent spots they're not
exactly white but you can see where the
oil didn't quite soak
in and there you
go perfectly
