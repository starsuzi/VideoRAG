hi i'm chef eric and thanks for watching dessert 
is one of my favorite parts of any meal and one  
of the things i love to put on my dessert is 
chocolate sauce almost any dessert you can  
imagine we'll do better have chocolate sauce on 
it why go to the store and buying a bottle you  
can make it at home with two simple ingredients 
I'm going to show you how quick and easy it is  
to make right now we're going to start off 
with some cream to make our chocolate sauce  
gotta be heavy cream no half-and-half and no 
milk and we also need chocolate chips here I  
have some bittersweet chocolate chips you could 
use some semi-sweet some milk chocolate can even  
use white chocolate if you like we start off 
by scalding the cream got to get the cream  
really nice and hot in a pot until bubbles are 
coming all around the cream chocolate chips go  
into a bowl take the skull that cream pour it 
right over the chocolate and let it sit for a  
little while and let it melt and stir it around 
to speed up that melting once that chocolate gets  
really nicely melted and totally smooth you 
wind up getting a really wonderful sauce the  
sauce will keep in the refrigerator for a couple 
of weeks and you can easily reheat it on top of  
the stove or in the microwave you're ready to 
drizzle this over a tart or some ice cream or  
a piece of cake this is one of my favorite 
things on the planet I know you'll love it  
too and I hope you enjoyed this tip check out
