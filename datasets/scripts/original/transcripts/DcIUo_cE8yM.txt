hey this is DAV with the shepherd school
and what we're going to do today is
we're going to test our soil to see if
it is acidic or if it is alkaline so um
is it more acid or is it more base and
so what I did did is I dug up a couple
of little scoops of dirt here from the
same spot and if you want to be really
accurate what you can do is dig up dirt
from several spots in your garden and
mix it together and if you even want to
be even more accurate what you can do is
you can buy a test kit but uh we're
going to do it without a test kit so
I've got my dirt and we're just going to
break it up a little
bit you want to get this without a lot
of worms or rock
or um plant Hatter and just try to get
just old dirt
okay and if you've got a kid and they is
interested in science this probably a
good thing for them to do and like I
said this isn't the most accurate in the
world but it'll work okay so here's our
dirt what we're going to do is we're
going to mix it with some uh vinegar
this happens to be apple cider but
distilled white works just as good it's
probably cheaper but this is what I had
when I went in the closet and we're just
going to mix it
in see how it's fizzing
I don't know if you can hear
that but it is
fizzing which means the acid is reacting
with the base and the soil so my soil is
uh alkaline all right so if I was
growing plants that liked alkaline
conditions I could do it just like it
was
and uh if I wanted neutral soil or
plants wanted neutral soil or acidic
soil I could amend this with something
like a um pine bark mulch or something
um so had this not worked had that not
reacted and we would need to see for the
base what you would then do and I'm
going to wash my spoon off for good
scientific
okay then what you do is you would
mix some water in
there and get it a good
slurry and then
mix some baking soda
and if it was a CTIC so this would Fizz
okay and since you can't do anything
with baking soda and vinegar
together make a little volcano okay so
anyway there we go that's all there is
to it hope that was useful to you and
until next next time you can always
