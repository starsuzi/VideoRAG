hello everyone um we are still cons uh
continuing the bakery theme and I was
wanting to do some cake slices soon with
a few roses on the
slices um so I wanted to go ahead and
show you how to do a tiny tiny
Rose um just fair warning it is over 90Â°
where I am and I don't have air
conditioning so
the clay is very very
soft it is much easier to do this in um
the 70s and even 80s than the '90s
so hopefully they won't turn to Mush
when I do
this okay so here we see little circles
this was if you want them exactly the
same color it was using the dusty rose
and sculpy a little bit less than half
to the trans Lucent
Primo so I mixed it and then I rolled it
flat now this one is on the thick um the
fourth thickest setting on the pasta
roller on mine the thickest is one so on
mine it's a number
four some do it in reverse so just the
fourth
thickest so what I'm going to do is show
you how to shape it in my fingers I
usually like shaping it on the table and
the paper peeling it away from the table
makes a perfect little um petal
Bend I'll show you what I mean in a
minute here but the way I'm going to
shape it is I have kind of a blunt flat
tool and I just kind of start
pulling in two
directions to try to start getting that
soft petal shape where it's not
completely round but it flares out
towards the
top
okay and I'm doing each petal here
individually so uh because I'm worried
about the
heat so now we're actually going to form
the center of our Rose now if it was on
a piece of paper it would do the same
thing it's doing on my finger now but
when we peel it it gives you a soft
slight Bend
backwards and that's really good for the
rose
so since it's so hot and I have long
fingernails now I usually I haven't done
this since I've had long fingernails
other than the couple I made for an
example um so it's a little bit
fiddly there we go so what I'm going to
do to help me along if you don't have
fingernails you could just spiral this
but since I have fingernails I'm going
to start the spiral on my safety
pin and I'm going to roll
this in a circle around the safety
pin and there we go there's our nice
soft Center petal for the rose going to
put that down on the table as we get
another petal
shape and then I'm going to do the same
thing I'm just trying to
soften widen the top for a nice soft
petal and then I'm peeling it off
keeping that nice Bend in the
top and getting it ready here
for the middle petal okay so for the
roses from here on out what you do is
you Center it
halfway um in front and halfway behind
that little
crease so that way you have your crease
you press it up against that crease and
then you wrap it on both
sides you wrap it on both sides of that
very center
one and as you can see the petals are
have that soft Bend kind of going
backwards which is nice in a
rose then I'll do another petal but it's
like that until you are done basically
so each time you add one you just add
along the seam last done I just do um
now that you have a full Petal on there
now I do the um seam that's on the right
side of the
petal
so I have the new petal
there and you can see
how there's a right side and left
side I go
halfway and Roll It
on should I do one more guys you're not
seeing the whole rows go
together um I've had longer tutorials so
we'll go for a little bit
longer so I'm
shaping there's just a cake I haven't
done in a really long time and since
we're on Bakery sweets I thought that it
would be fitting so I take the rose
again and I go
halfway and then I roll forward and back
and if it's not wanting to
look like the petals coming out very far
you can push it
down so you still have
that nice soft Bend
okay
so here we go and I'll do just this one
last one for you and I usually like
about seven or eight petals on
there this one looks kind of nice the
way it
is but from here I just rest it on paper
and bake it just like that so that will
bake and once it's
done
oops once it's done um you'll have that
conle
shape from Rolling it to get it ready
for the
cake all I do is cut off the back
end
so I just cut it
flat there we
go and now we have a rose that is ready
to place on our
cake nice flat
back there we go so here's a couple of
little roses um for our NE potin our
pale neopolitan
cake and um really quick I'll take two
of these and um I just want to show you
a simple
leaf because I don't think we need to do
a leaf but I will roll it into a ball
and then roll it on one side as a
teardrop
shape and then I will smash from the
point out so there we have our Leaf
shape
and I usually use a sewing pin cuz it's
a little thinner but you want a PIN to
put that indent in and if you want if
you like your leaves to have those
little lines you can create them with
this but I just bring the sides up a
little bit and pinch down now these I
actually make when um when I put them on
the cake I don't do these in advance the
Roses you have to do in advance but with
the leaves I do when I'm decorating the
cake so I'll probably make one then so
you guys can see it and I'm going to be
doing them in a pale white chocolate
color so um here we are and I hope that
uh this is a good rose that you guys
would like to try it's a little easier
to get used to roses if you're doing
them it's slightly larger and you could
do this with any circle
shape I'll form one more petal here for
those of you who want to see it one more
time
but basically you want to
flatten
out two
edges and in the center to make just
flare it out so the bottom side is
thinner and the top side is thicker so
there we have that
soft
petal for those of you who've been
watching from the beginning we'll do one
more Center just because I'm here
so I'm going to peel it
off and then I'm going to put an indent
right
here
and start folding it
in and then I
will wrap The Petal around the safety
pin here this is hot weather like I said
if you don't have hot weather you can
make the center of your
rose um just by Rolling it in your
fingertips here with how hot it is I had
to have a little extra help there in
getting it
started so there we go I hope that you
enjoyed this these are our tiny itty
bitty roses for our
cakes so um hopefully I'll have some
cakes up soon it depends on the weather
since it's so warm here
um talk to you soon guys bye
