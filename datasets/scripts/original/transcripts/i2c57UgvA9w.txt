you might be thinking that my lips are
stained red or they look like they're
stained red and that's because they are
in fact stained red i put this stuff on
earlier pixie
lip blush in love
is that what it's called yeah i think so
hold on
yeah shade number four love
and uh it just doesn't come off this is
about as as much as i can get it off at
the moment
so i have to wait a couple of weeks for
that to finally come off it's good
highly recommend these little pixie pens
it's like a felt tip so you can get a
really accurate line and then use the
wider bit to fill it in it's very good
and long lasting
now
i'm filming november beauty roundup
early because i've got all the christmas
gift guides coming so we need to get
this out of the way but also i've got a
lot of very exciting things to tell you
very exciting so stay tuned
and first of all
i want to show you these gift sets from
pie now as you know pie is one of my
favorite skincare brands um all really
natural organic ingredients really great
for people with allergies and sensitive
skin cause they list all of their
ingredients they don't hide any
ingredients behind things like perfume
or whatever
anyway i was really excited to see
they've brought out these christmas gift
sets um
they're really nicely packaged like this
it's two different ones serenity and
tranquility they already come gift boxed
and
one of them has this selection of oils
in it so it's got a bath oil and a body
oil
really beautiful
high-end ingredients
um smell really beautiful i just love
their products and the other one the
slightly bigger gift set has got um
himalayan and dead sea therapeutic bath
salts
and a nice big kind of heavy glass jar
and then a calming body cream as well
now i thought that these sets would be
priced about 25 30 pounds but they're
not the small one with the oils is 13.99
and the larger one of the bath salts in
the body lotion is 15.99
so i couldn't actually believe that they
were priced so well um i kind of think
they've gone a bit bonkers over at pi
anyway
when i told them how much i loved them
um they offered to do a read offer so
every reader that buys these through the
link i'll put the link in the
information box um because it takes you
to a special page but for every set that
you purchase you get a free orange
organic lip balm which is also gorgeous
it's in a tiny little tin and it comes
with this little muslin gift bag so you
could use that as a separate gift or you
could have it as a gift to yourself i
often have gifts to myself
but anyway it makes this even more of a
great deal so that's pretty much sorted
out my christmas shopping for this year
so i'm very pleased about that i'll put
the link in the information box but also
if you zip over to the website all the
information is there as well
what else um beauty product of the month
gemma kid
uh cream blusher in pawpaw which i
absolutely adore it's just a really nice
matte cream blush um that you apply with
your fingertips
can't really put it on over what i've
got on already but
i'll give it a try
um just really really brilliant if you
liked the becca um
lip and cheek tint in blossom that i
featured earlier in the summer this is
actually really similar and a lot less
money as well i'm so excited about what
i've got to tell you that i can't really
concentrate on beauty products and
so i might just jump straight to my new
bag that i've got which is a mulberry
lily bag
whether you can see that she's got it in
black leather i get a handbag pretty
much every winter
or every other winter just a classic bag
that will kind of tide me through
and this is this year's purchase
so that's the mulberry lily i should put
the link to that in the information box
as well so you can see
more details sizes and stuff like that
because it comes in loads of different
variations but it's just really gorgeous
and so i'm very excited about that but
the most exciting news is
i'll tell you what i'm just going to
drop a little video clip in and then it
will speak for itself
that's right people i'm finally getting
my kitten i'm so excited i just can't
wait i pick him up on the 29th it's a
little boy kitten and he's 14 weeks old
in fact i think he'll be 15 weeks by the
time i pick him up
and i think he's going to be called ted
although i'm not completely sure yet so
i'm really really excited about that so
excited that i'm finding it difficult to
do any kind of work or have any kind of
normal conversation so i'm probably
going to leave this beauty round up
there um
just because
i'm just too excited basically um i'm
sure there'll be many more videos of the
kitten so maybe i'll have to set up a
different channel so i don't bore
everybody who hates kittens
not i don't know if anyone hates kittens
surely not um
but i can see why you'd get bored of
kittens so
maybe i'll stick the videos on a
different channel
anyway
that's my exciting news of the month
i've missed out loads of brilliant
beauty products probably that i should
be showing you but as i said before far
too excited there's loads of beauty
stuff over on the website so have a look
over there
because there's something new every day
so make sure you're following on there
and i shall see you in the next video
