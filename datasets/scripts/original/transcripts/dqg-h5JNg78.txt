welcome to DIY boy saw today with me
hey are you Savvy natural Lisas welcome
to DIY Saturday today we're doing bug
repellent candles so in the beginning I
really wanted to call this the no zika
uh serious because I was like I ain't
getting zika no no no no no zika but
apparently uh because I was the only one
that thought that was a proper title for
this series
uh Josh and my sister said I was crazy
so we're not calling this the zika
series we're gonna call this the bye bye
Buck uh mosquito series because you know
zika is really you know on the news
everywhere and my sister and Josh were
like oh well you you're just being
paranoid you always do this all the time
you know I was trying to wear a hazmat
suit when Ebola came out so yeah you
guys I was just I'm just not for you
know anytime the news tries to tell me
something I'm like ready to get the
Hazmat suit on so they said that you
know zika may go away like the rest of
them dish on there so you shouldn't be
so paranoid so because I'm the only one
paranoid We're not gonna call this the
zika series but if you watch news like
me and they tell you and you really want
to take this serious then you know me
and you are on the same page with this
one
so today we're working with citronella
essential oil
um
that's what you will need citronella
actually is a mosquito repellent
mosquitoes don't like the scent of
citronella oil so it tends to you know
just make them go away I keep this
candle around the house I don't even
sometimes have to burn it and it just
works perfectly now I will say this
before we get into the rest of the
ingredients I did do the video before I
made the the introduction to talk to you
guys so if it sounds like I'm rambling
it's because in my head I really wanted
to do a really cool design with the
candle because I'm giving them away
because some people at my job are
concerned about zika as well so it's
just not me so if you're concerned about
zika just give these away as gifts and
because it's the fourth of July soon and
we tend to have like this little shindig
at my job because they take about three
to four weeks to cure and this is in
June so by the time they're here it'll
be July and they'll be ready to burn so
I'm just rambling in the video that's
just what I want to say I am rambling
about everything because I'm really
thinking the design is cute they came
out great as you see in the pictures but
uh it was just a hot mess as I was doing
it you guys so just bear with me in the
vid in the video
so what you will need for this tutorial
an ounce and a half of citronella oil to
16 ounces of candle wax now you will
need candle wax I got IU soy and you
could get this at uh amazon.com Oh it's
leaking oh oh you guys
you could get that at amazon.com you
will also need wicks I got these at
amazon.com they have like this package
where you can buy the wick and the
candle wax for like under
so much I forgot how much it was I think
it was about 30. you will also need
um a jar like really cute jars I got
these at the Dollar Tree they make like
really cute ones for for you to just
give away also you need color it now oh
oh I have candles everywhere now you
guys
um
now I'm using cat uh this
um candle coloring which I got at Amazon
so you could get yours at Amazon.com or
anywhere I would say
um and it just colors it because I'm
doing red and blue and the white in the
middle
you guys to see the picture how it was
gonna go in my head it really turned out
great but
it was just it it really turned out
pretty it was just you know it wasn't
where I wanted to go I seen this thing
on Pinterest and my Pinterest recipes
work but
the way she was doing it and then I
found out she used crayon so it really
didn't go the way I wanted it to go but
it looks great so let's go make our
condos you guys okay you guys so we're
about to make our Converse
um I actually use Crazy Glue not hot
glue or wax for the bottom of the jar
and this was just for me I'm actually
going to give these away as gifts
um so I like to put just a little crazy
glue
I actually put a lot
just like this and you swirl it around
and
I add it to this jaw
now the key to get it to stick is
you want to
put it sort of in the middle or just let
it drop it just really depends on how
big your jar is I take a pin and
I do
that you could use and try to center it
you want it to stick up straight
and you want it to be a flat surface
okay
see how this thing's up straight and
then you just take your PIN
or your Chopstick depending now this is
for me so I'm not really worried about
it that's how that goes and these are
the ones I did last night
so they've been sitting up straight for
about
the whole day I've seen ounces of candle
wax and you want about eight ounces each
of liquid so this is eight ounces and
this is eight ounces and what I do is so
the colors don't
get together is
I make sure I stir them because you want
them to be not too hot you want them to
be just right and I use a towel to mix
so I'm going to let these cool down just
a little bit
and then we'll then we'll be back to
Paul
okay so we're back and the wax has cool
just a little so I'm just going to pour
and swirl a little bit
that's what I'm going to do
I'm creating like a
I don't know if this makes sense but
like uh
sort of
I wanted it to be like a sort of bluish
uh White effect
so
okay there we go
okay so move this one over and we'll do
the blue
pretty much what the blue will do the
same thing okay so we're back oh
in my head you guys
I wanted to swirl this and swirl that
but apparently I need a smaller jars to
swirl so we're just gonna pretty much
let this flow now you can do red white
and blue just to make it festive because
Fourth of July is coming pretty soon and
these candles need to cure anyway so
when you give them away you can go oh
what beauty
for the holiday so
we're just gonna add
the blue to the uh the red and the red
and pray
you guys I've made a mess look at this
just a mess I am just messing everything
in my head it looked really nice you
guys you guys know I'm an artist so
sometimes I just have to work my magic
and hope for the best they really look
pretty I kind of like it it looks really
good it'll probably look nice when it
dries so we'll see how this goes but
what you want to do now is pour the
white in out this is pretty hot
so I don't know if the colors are all
Blended to look funky kind of tacky
looking
but you don't know until you try but
just for references if you ever do do
this
um
make sure it's cooled down to about 150
or 140 I couldn't find my thermometer
um but make sure I know it's not a two I
know but because I've been doing candles
and wax melts for so long
you know sometimes you just don't use
the proper utensils and it's just a mess
pretty hot so I think the colors are
gonna blend but I'm just gonna Jazz up
the top anyway so
just bear with me you guys
but I didn't want it to look chunky
because the inside looks really chunky
right now I don't know if you guys can
see it looks really chunky so I didn't
want it to look too chunky so it'll
probably look nice
[Music]
and what I'm gonna do is blow dry it
and then I'm Gonna Fill This one up to
the top with another one
and
[Music]
there we go see so once this dries I'm
Gonna Fill This one up and then what I'm
going to do is
um let me put this back on right now so
it could be straight
what I'm going to do is uh
uh Jazz up the top make it look really
pretty
okay so our candles are finally done and
this is what they look like I added a
bit of glitter and I'm also going to cut
the string just a little bit once
they've cured I like to cut it
um just a little bit so let me just give
you guys an example of how I cut it I
cut it to
the tip and I'll probably cut it just a
little bit more because that's still a
bit too long
so
I really hope you enjoyed this tutorial
also this one has glitter too because
you guys know I love to glitter
everything so this one has glitter as
well and this one is just my little
experiment that I did that I really
really like so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this mosquito candle repellent
