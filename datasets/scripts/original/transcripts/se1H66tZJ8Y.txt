hi risa here and i just want to show you
what to do with leeks
so this is a leek it looks just like a
big fat scallion basically a thicker
scallion and i just got these at the
farmer's market as you can see they're
like super dirty so what you're going to
do is you're going to cut off the end of
it
if i get my knife in there
and i'm putting that in my little bucket
to compost and then for these i'm gonna
like peel these outer leaves off because
it's like so crazy dirty when you buy
them from the store they won't be
disturbing but you will have to cut them
open and clean the inside because even
the ones from the store have a lot of
dirt in them
leeks have a great flavor they're great
to put into soups and stews
you just pretty much use them like an
onion but they kind of have a different
flavor than an onion
they're just really good and then you
can use some of the greens depending how
they look
but i usually cut them down far and i
see like how that has yellowish on it i
don't really want that one
and so i'm gonna peel off this other
layer
and
get dirt everywhere
and i'm gonna peel off one more layer
because i didn't like that outer leaf
so you can still see there's a bunch of
dirt so what i'm going to do now
after i stick all of this in my compost
pile
i am going to cut the leak
down the
center
so we're going to take it
and i'm going to cut it down the center
and then we're going to take it to the
sink
and we're going to pull it apart and
clean all the dirt out of there because
there's lots of dirt
so you definitely want to make sure you
rinse them well
so see all the dirt in
there just going to clean that out
and these are leaks from like i said
from the farmer's market and they were
picked like last night or just this
morning
so they're like super fresh and they are
a little dirtier than normal but even
the ones in the store
they're going to be dirty so make sure
you clean them
and then we're going to chop them up and
then i actually put them through my
spinner again
and clean them up again so i kind of i'm
trying to keep it
together so that i can cut them easier
okay so once you have them all cleaned
up
you're going to put it back together as
best you can
and we're going to come over here and
we're going to slice it all up
so i obviously need a cleaner map for
that
and you want to slice them i normally
slice it pretty thin
so i just slice them up then and then
what i do
is i'm gonna like i said wash them again
i'm gonna put them through my
um what do you call that lettuce cleaner
and i'm gonna
do another rinse with them
and then you can use them they're ready
to use
so you can saute them just like you
would onions and garlic
and it just adds another great flavor or
what you can do
is
you can stick them in a ziploc bag and
freeze them and then what i do is i just
pull them out whenever i want them so i
have this really great pita pizza recipe
that uses um
leeks and garlic and onion and zucchini
ribbon zucchini so i just pulled this
out and i grab however much i stick it
in my saute pan
so that's basically what you can do with
leeks it's super easy and like i said
i'm just gonna
chop this up and then stick it back into
my little salad spinner that's what it's
called
and i'm going to clean it up a little
bit more so i hope this is helpful
because i know that i never really knew
what to do with leaks or how to clean
them and so i hope this helps you and i
hope you try them you're going to love
