hello and welcome to how to grow dailies
from seed this video is sponsored by the
gift of
food.com the first step is to buy some
seeds and to buy a propagator train are
both available from most garden
stores the propagator tray has a clear
plastic lid which keeps the seeds warm
while they are
germinating step two fil propagator tray
with
compost press the compost down to remove
any air bus
step three water the compost we're doing
this now because if you did it when the
seeds were added you may wash them
away step four place the seeds on top of
the compost always plant a few more
seeds than you need in case some fail to
germinate
for for
step five cover the seats with compost
and press it down
gently step six add a label in case in
case you forget what you've
sewn step seven cover the propagated a
tray with its lid and leave in a warm
place step eight keep warm and moist and
within a couple of weeks the seeds will
have germinated
less than half of my seeds have
germinated so I'm going to add some more
seeds to make up the
numbers to do this I'm just gently
pushing the seeds into the
compass when the plants have two sets of
leaves it's time to transplant them from
the propagator tray into individual
pots firstly water the plants it makes
them easier to remove
then fill the plant box with
compass the next step is to water the
compass
make a small hole with your finger in
the center of each
pot holding the plant by its leaves
carefully remove it from the propagator
tray without damaging The
Roots place the plant in the hole in the
plant pot and then gently press down the
compost around the roots
Step 11 keep warm and watered and the
plants will soon start bushing out
step 12 when the plants become too big
for their pots it's time to start
planting them
outside the first thing to do is to give
the plants a good water
in next dig and rake your soil and
remove any stones and
weeds Mark out a straight line with a
piece of string tied between two
sticks make a small hole insert the
plant and then firm the soil around the
roots plant the next Point leaving a
space of 9 to 12 in
finally give the plants a good soaking
Step 13 keep the plants watered and Weed
Free within about 2 to 3 weeks the first
bods will start appearing
watch out for AIDS and move any dead
heads to prong the flowering period
