hi I'm cat and today I'm showing you how
to make this miniature toilet for your
dollhouse both the seats open and close
and the tank lid comes off as
well if you like this video don't forget
to subscribe leave a thumbs up or a
comment below and I really hope you
enjoy
it the best thing about this particular
project is it uses only three coffee
stir sticks and a bunch of leftover wood
scraps from previous
projects I'm going to start by putting
some of the coffee stir sticks in some
water I want to leave them for 24 hours
but I did use some of them before that
time
period and then I'm using first a piece
from an extra drumble popsicle stick
this is the one that's about 7 in
long and I used a piece that was about
an inch and
3/4 then I used my first coffee stir
stick that was already
soaked and I wrap that around the top
from a paint bottle the reason I'm using
this top is it's about an inch in
diameter the same as the
sticks so wrap it twist it and allow it
to
dry now most of the sticks that I use
during this video are going to be wet
when I use them
and that's the way I prefer to do so but
you can do it this method as
well this way it dries in a curve and
all I have to do is to glue it to the
stick to form the base
[Music]
[Music]
I cut off another piece from another
extra drumbo popsicle stick that was
about an inch in length and I glued that
in place as
well then I use four tips from extra
jumble popsicle sticks and all of them
are about an inch long and I'm going to
cut these off until they're a little
over 3/4 of an
inch draw a trapezoid shape going
inward a little narrower than the stick
and then you want to dip it in the
[Music]
center and cut all four of those pieces
[Music]
out then glue them together to form a
box and of course since all the pieces
of trapezoids they're going to show form
a 3D trapezoid box with the base being
wider than the
top and once dry you can glue that on
top of the
base you'll notice that I sanded off the
edges of these just to smooth them out
and round them
[Music]
slightly then to form the bowl with the
toilet I'm using some scrap Bossa wood
from my pool table and from my bathtub
this is the 3 and 32 in uh piece so it's
fairly wide as far as Balsa goes but
it's still very very
thin and then I shaped an oval out of
paper to fit directly over the top of
the
base and then I trace that same oval
onto my sheet of
Balsa and then cut that piece out and
then Trace that piece onto another piece
of
Balsa and then cut that piece out and on
and on until I had four pieces
[Music]
then for the last one I trace that onto
a piece of
Balsa but this time instead of cutting
it out I extended it a little bit and I
ended up extending it about an inch and
a half to form a small
paddle now for the inside of the toilet
bowl I'm going to have a little piece of
straw here and and this is just to give
this the illusion of the toilet going
back where the waist would go um of
course the step is completely optional
but if you choose to do so it does add a
little more detail to your
toilet and I'm going to use another
piece of straw to gently drill a hole
into the
Balsa that's how soft the balle W is
[Music]
I reserved the piece that I drilled out
and put that to the side and then I
glued the straw into the smaller seat
where I had the hole punched and glued
the little tip from the wood onto
[Music]
that then with the other seats I cut out
small circles on the
[Music]
inside then I began to glue those pieces
together with the smallest one at the
bottom and the larger pieces at the
[Music]
top and you can start to see how a
toilet is starting to take place
there so I'm going to go on ahead and
sand off that entire middle section just
to round out the curve of the
bowl I'm using a nail file on the
outside and on the inside I'm using a
skewer stick wrapped with some sandpaper
the same as I used for my pool to table
video and then finally this is an
optional step as well again it just adds
a little more detail with that last
piece trace the bottom of the other Bowl
set and then use your exactl knife to
just kind of pick out a little bit of
wood just a couple of
layers then glue that piece to the
bottom and you can sand that off as well
to form the rest of the
bowl and then sand out that top paddle
part and you can glue that to the top of
the
bowl and then I use one of the wet
coffee stir sticks and just super glue
that all along the base directly under
the large paddle shape
[Music]
then glue that entire assembly onto the
base
[Music]
I used the remainder of the stick that I
used for the bowl and flex that just a
little bit and then I glued in place
toward the end of the paddle part and
the end of the
base then I use some jumbo popsicle
stick pieces to form the side panels
just simply trace the outside of the
[Music]
curve and then you can see there's a
small space on the inside you're going
to want to trace the inside of that
too cut out two of each
[Music]
piece and then glue them together to
form a
panel glue the panels in place on either
side of coffee of the coffee stir stick
and then you can use your file or your
sanding tool to smooth out that
[Music]
section finally I used several little
pieces from Jumbo popsicle sticks and
cut them down to 1 and 1/8 of an inch
then I Glu those together into a
box then I also cut out a small panel to
form the
[Music]
bottom and I use my file to round out
the edges the same as I did with the
base you can also use a little wood
putty to cover up the
seams and then cut a small piece that
would fit over the top this isn't going
to line up all the way to the side so
we're going to use these coffee stir
stick scraps to build it up a little bit
this is going to make it a little wider
and a little
longer then I use my last wet coffee
stir stick to make the sides of the
[Music]
lid put the lid on top of your tank and
it's not going to stick on there so
you're going to have to hold it in place
and then just glue the coffee stir stick
to the lid part
[Music]
only then I use the pen to trace only
the top portion of the seat and do that
twice and go ahead and close it off at
the
[Music]
top and then on one of the pieces you
want to draw an
inside cut both pieces out and sand
them finally I painted my toilets
white and then I used a little bit of a
glue gun and a yellow glue stick so you
guys can see and I glued a pipe shape on
there to make the hinges I cut pieces
from an aluminum pie pan and cut them
into little strips then I cut off a
small piece from a
headpin i formed loops around the
headpin with the aluminum strips and
although I made five I only used
three and then I cut off tiny little
fragments from a stir stick and glue
them on either side of the elongated
part of the
paddle glue the head pin directly on top
with three of the aluminum strips on
it and if you flip one of the strips
back you'll have two strips facing
forward glue those to the bottom
seat and then flip that other piece
forward and glue those to the bottom of
the
lid then you can glue the tank onto the
top and for the handle I'm simply using
an end of a
toothpick glue all into place and make
sure you give it a couple of good coats
of varnish that's it thanks so much for
watching guys bye-bye
