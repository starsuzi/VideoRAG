peace um i'm about to show you real
quick how to laminate
using an iron
and a laminating sheet and the
pillowcase
real easy
first thing you do is you get whatever
it is that you're about to laminate
ready
you get your iron hot
you sit the pillowcase
on top of
the laminate sheet
and you just start ironing on top
of the pillowcase
and as you're doing it
you can kind of peek
okay
to see
how it's doing and you can see that it's
starting to melt
the laminating sheet is starting to fuse
together
so i just change the setting on my iron
to make it a little hotter
just keep going
and you just keep peeking at it
the areas that have not fused together
you go over those areas
and you can kind of hear it
as you go over the plastic you can hear
what parts are not melted or fused
and you kind of run the iron over those
areas
and this one is pretty much done
if you hold it up you can see that it's
fused it's shiny i could have let it sit
a little longer but
just for time purposes i just wanted to
show you real quick how easy it is to
laminate
using an iron in a pillowcase
peace
