vegetable oil

you're going to tip the mix in this time
yup the one then there you are there's
the mix
straight into the bowl that's it give it
a shake
yay that's it there we go
all in well done thank you george
get the mixer
and there we are two minutes mixing
job done now once again i've got the
cases ready
thank you george thank you
behave
now this time because we're making fairy
cakes rather than
muffins aren't we george thank you i'm
i'm gonna half
fill the cases rather than fill them
to two thirds as we did with the muffins
because we don't want the mix
coming up over the top of the case
again using two spoons
helps keep down the mess

i shall go and put these in the oven and
no doubt george will lick the bowl
