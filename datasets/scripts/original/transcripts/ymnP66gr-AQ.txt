how to remove iron-on patches
iron-on patches are attached to fabric
with a heat activated or fusible
adhesive while these patches are easy to
apply they can be much more difficult to
remove
additionally removed patches tend to
leave behind unsightly glue residue
luckily there are a few
tricks you can use to remove iron-on
patches
method 1 removing with an iron
one check to see if your item can take
the heat
unless you added the patch yourself you
will first need to make sure your item
won't be damaged by ironing it
not all iron-on patches are actually
applied with heat pick a small
inconspicuous part of the item not
easily visible
during normal use place wax paper or a
thin dish towel on top of the area press
down with a preheated iron on the small
area you're testing hold it for about 15
seconds remove the iron and check for
damage or discoloration on your
item if you are treating a delicate item
make sure the iron is on the proper
setting if you don't have experience
ironing this type of fabric the adhesive
remover method is probably a better idea
to cover the patch
position your item so that the cloth
part of the patch is exposed place
either wax paper or a thin cloth towel
directly over the patch make sure the
covering is completely clean and free
from any substance that could melt into
the fabric of your item
three iron the patch
pre-heat your iron to its highest
setting before use press your iron down
on top of the paper cloth where the
patch would be hold it there for about
15 seconds remove the iron and the
covering from your item if the glue does
not appear to
have softened apply the iron again keep
adding heat until the adhesive melts
for peel the patch off
the heat from the iron should be enough
to melt the glue and temporarily make it
sticky lift the edge of the patch up and
peel it off of your item hold onto the
item with one hand and peel with your
other you can use your fingers to do
this but be cautious as the adhesive
will be hot if you have trouble lifting
up the first part of the patch try using
tweezers or a butter knife tweezers will
be able to slide between the patch and
your item and grip the patch well if you
don't
have tweezers slip a butter knife
between the patch and your item lift up
to start the patch and remove the rest
of it with your fingers if the patch is
large you may have to make a few passes
with the iron feel up large patches

method 2 using adhesive remover
one purchase a fabric safe adhesive
remover
glue removers that are xylene or orange
oil-based work well pick a liquid based
product able to soak through fabric an
adhesive remover that comes in a spray
bottle will be much easier to work with
for this purpose camon brands are goo
gone to solve it and goof off
rubbing alcohol can also be an effective
alternative
to patch test your clothing
even if the adhesive remover is
advertised as fabric safe it is still
possible that it may stain your
particular item you will need to test it
out first before using the remover on a
patch do this over a clean sink to avoid
making a mess
find a small inconspicuous area on your
item that is not easily visible during
normal use for example the inside back
bottom edge of a hat or jacket would be
a good choice dab a small amount of
adhesive remover on to this spot
work the adhesive remover into the
fabric using your fingers or a clean rag
rinse off the adhesive remover and check
for discoloration
three expose the area underneath the
patch
if your item is a t-shirt a hat or a
pair of paints turn it inside out you
will need to access the fabric that is
bonded to the patch if your item is a
canvas bag simply lay it out flat upside
down
for apply your adhesive remover
squirt or pour the glue remover
liberally on the back of the cloth use
enough that is soaks through your item
completely make sure you cover the whole
area behind the patch work the remover
into the fabric using either your
fingers or a clean rag wait about one
minute
the remover to loosen the patch
five peel off the patch
the adhesive remover should successfully
soften the glue making it sticky the
pack should now easily come off your
item turn the I to right side out hold
it with one hand grip the edge of the
patch between the index finger and thumb
of your other hand pull back to lift the
edge of the patch up and off your item
work your way around the patch until it
has been entirely peeled away
six repeat on any stubborn areas
if part of the patch is still stuck to
your item try repeating the process
focusing on the spots where the adhesive
did not soften properly reapply the
adhesive remover however many times it
takes to completely remove the patch
however if the glue remover you used has
not softened the adhesive at all you
will likely need to try a different one
if you don't plan on keeping the patch
trim off what you've already peeled off
with a pair of scissors this will make
it much easier to
work with and keep the patch from
sticking back on to your item
method 3 removing residue
one check for stains
the glue from your patch will likely
leave a residue behind if the area where
your patch was is now discolored or
sticky you will need to take further
action to make your item looking clean
and like new again if you used the
adhesive remover
method launder your item first this may
remove the adhesive completely on its
own
to apply adhesive remover directly to
the residue
squirt or pour more adhesive remover on
to the patch massage it and using your
fingers or a clean rag allow it to work
for approximately one minute you can
also make your own adhesive remover at
home just mix two parts baking soda with
one part
coconut oil and a few drops of orange
essential oil this all-natural adhesive
remover works well at removing residue
but not for removing the patch itself it
is a thick paste that is unable to
easily soaked through fabrics
three launder your item as usual
simply wash your item using whatever
method you normally would do this as
soon as possible to remove the solvent
in case it may damage your item over
time if the item is machine wash safe go
ahead and throw it into your washing
machine with a normal load
of laundry hands soaked delicate items
using cold or room temperature water
with a small amount of detergent if the
glue seems especially stuck on try
scrubbing it with a soft toothbrush
after the adhesive remover has been
worked in
by some liquid laundry detergent
directly to the residue patches a
pretreatment if there is still some
residue left after you've washed your
item try repeating the process with more
adhesive remover it may take a few tries
to totally remove the stain
do not place the item in the dryer until
the stain has been completely removed
doing so may set the stain and make it
harder to clean
for use white vinegar for especially
tough stains
white vinegar often works to loosen glue
enough for water to rinse it away before
soaking first try saturating the spot
with white vinegar and wash as normal
this works well for delicate items with
caked on glue from the iron method
if spot treatment doesn't work try
soaking your item overnight for white
items you may use undiluted vinegar to
keep colored fabric from bleeding dilute
the vinegar in water using one cup of
vinegar per gallon of water
while white vinegar is generally safe to
use on clothing always be sure to do a
patch test first to be sure use white
vinegar only other types may stay in
clothing
tips use the adhesive remover to get rid
of glue residue on your iron wait for it
to cool apply goo and wipe off if using
an iron and adhesive remover together
exercise caution many types of adhesive
removers are
flammable if the iron patch test causes
discoloration use adhesive remover
instead and vice versa because clothing
is made using many different dyeing
methods and colors it's very difficult
to determine which method will work best
knowing
fabric type alone
