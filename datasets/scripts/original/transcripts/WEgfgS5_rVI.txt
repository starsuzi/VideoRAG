Its really important that you keep the baby's
environment as free from bacteria as possible.
So you always wanna have sanitizer and soap
on hand.
And really wash your hands with soap or sanitizer
every time you get near your baby.
If they are sucking on pacifiers or bottles
you really wanna sterilize those bottles or
pacifiers, or any toys they may be chewing
on.
You can do this with a sterilizer or a simple
pot of water and stove.
You also wanna clean your babies' environment
if there are any pets or siblings running
around the house.
There are many products on the market that
are free of harmful toxins and are completely
safe to spray on toys, on high chairs.
Anything your baby touches, you'll wanna clean.
And if the friend is over or a sibiling's
there, they are touching their mouth and are
putting it on the baby's toys; the baby touches
that and put it in their mouth, you're gonna
spread bacteria.
So its very important to wash their pacifiers
often, perhaps once a day.
Launder their sheets often, launder their
blankets if you are taking the blanket out
and really try to create a bacteria free environment
as much as possible for your child.
Exposure to bacteria is actually good for
your child in small amounts but too many germs
will only make your child sick.
So simple cleaning and sterilizing will easily
keep your environment very healthy.
