Hello everyone its Lola here again
And today I'm going to be showing you how to make a very soft tender and tasty pita bread
all you need for this pita bread is a couple of pantry ingredients in little bit of time and a little bit of effort and
Your pizza bread is going to be ready in less than two hours. So let's get started
the first thing I'm going to do is to make a kind of sponge and
For that I'm going to be using a little bit of warm water
some sugar
yeast and some flour
Now mix this together until everything is well combined
I'm going to be covering this at this point and I'm going to be leaving this for about
Ten minutes so that this yeast come bloom
So this mixture has been resting for ten minutes now and as you can see the yeast as already bloomed
So at this point I'm going to be adding my all-purpose flour a little bit of salt and some olive oil
Now mix this together very well until a kind of shaggy mass of dough is formed
At this point don't be tempted to add more flour. It's going to be wet and that is exactly what we want
So I'm going to be transferring this to a lightly floured work surface
And I'm going to be needing this for about five to six minutes until it becomes really smooth
So during the kneading process it's okay to add a little bit of more flour
but try as much as you can not to overdo this because if you do the dough is going to become very
Hard and we don't want that
We want our dough to be kind of wet because that is going to help to form the pockets
By the time we put the dough in the oven
So my dough is now ready as you can see, it's really very soft and kind of wet
What's really smooth? This is exactly what we want
Like I said earlier this is going to allow us to achieve that Zaid pockets in a pizza bread. I
Will now be taking this
Inside my glass bowl and I'm going to be rubbing it all around with a little bit of olive oil
This is really prevents the dough from forming a crust at this point
I'm just going to be covering this and I will leave it in a warm place to rise for one hour
So here we go. This dough has been resting for about one hour now and as you can see it's looking really good
It's as reasonable to almost three times. Its original size
At this point, I'm just going to punch down this dough to remove the excess trapped air
And I'm going to be transferring this dough back to my work surface
Now I'm going to be dividing this dough into its part
Just take this dough one at a time and begin to roll it out into a circular disc
The wider you roll this dude, Athena. Your pizza bread is going to be for me
I don't like my pizza bread to be too thin
So I'm not going to rule it out too white, but this totally depends on your personal preference
So I'm okay with this circumference at this point
I'll just be transferring this on a parchment paper
now I
Choose to use a parchment paper because it's going to be easy for me to lift it up
Once I'm ready to cook my bread
I'm going to be covering this with a damp clean kitchen - well and this is going to prevent your dough from forming a crust
So I'm going to be leaving this to rest again for about 10 to 15 minutes
And the next thing to do is to start cooking it inside our oven. I already have my oven preheated to
475 degrees
Fahrenheit I also have my iron skillets in the oven. It's really hot right now
you can also use a tray if you don't have a iron skillet, it's works just as well and
This bread should bloom after about two minutes
So let's watch
what I like to do at this point is just to get a good chair beside my oven and
Get myself a very cold glass of juice sit down and watch as my pizza pockets is forming
So this is looking really beautiful
Right now as you can see, it has really bloomed but this is actually ready to be served at this point
But I like to just Brown the other side for a little bit
So I'm just going to flip it over and place it back in my oven for another extra minutes or thereabouts
and there we have it our pizza bread is ready and
Please do remember to cover this with a damp kitchen towel, so they don't dry out
So this pita bread is very versatile. You can eat it with your hummus
You can dip it in curry sauce or any other good sauce of your choice and you can eat it the way it is
So that is it again for today. I hope you enjoy this recipe
If you do, don't forget to leave a thumbs up for me until next time. I'll talk to you shortly
enjoy
