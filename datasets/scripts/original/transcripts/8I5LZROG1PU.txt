all right everyone Cody here today I'm
going to show you how to un crystallize
honey at least the way I do it so here's
a little bear of crystallized honey it's
a couple years old and uh I want to be
able to squeeze it out of the
jar I've also got this uh bucket with uh
maybe a gallon and a half of honey still
in it it's all crystallized I actually
prefer it that way but uh it's kind of
difficult to get into jars when it's
like that so I'm going to go ahead and
un crystallize it
today now they recomend you know like a
usually they say just to put it in like
a cup of hot water you know not boiling
but hot
water for a little while and that'll un
crystallize the honey but uh I find that
just setting it inside of a hot
car for an entire day we'll do the trick
just as
well let's see how that works
all right well the sun's
down my mom took the other car so I had
to move the honey into this truck here
but uh same difference right still a hot
vehicle nice dark color looks like the
honey and the bear
is Thoroughly
liquid actually feels quite warm
still see what happened inside this
[Music]
bucket yeah I think that's good see I
get my my uh scoop out of there
now now it's still a little grainy could
probably go a little
longer but at least I'll be able to get
it into jars and
stuff and now what am I going to do with
this so uh that's how I liquefy my honey
again just put it somewhere
hot
okay
