folks it's Glen the ball chef and on
tonight's menu we're going to be putting
together some Hungarian
goulash this certainly is not the recipe
you had back when you were in grammar
school where they used ground meat and
uh elbow macaroni noodles a little bit
of tomato sauce and some uh cafeteria
spices oh no it's not that one and it is
not probably the Hungarian version which
is kind of more of a soup with some
little homemade noodles in it I don't
really care for that one I've had that
one too both the first and the second
are not my style this is more the
Continental Cuisine Hungarian goulash
that most
westerners would find most appealing so
I'm going to show you exactly how I do
mine started out here we've got 3
lbs of cut up
Chuck and uh you don't use need to use
an expensive cut of meat on this dish at
all because it's going to be stewed down
and there's no sense in wasting it so
I'm going to pour in just a little Li Li
Liberal Liberal Liberal I hate that word
amount of uh
flour here my uh Mixing Bowl
here all these folks out here that are
so germ conscious we've got on some
plastic
gloves so that nobody dies from any
anything or people tell me I'm going to
die of this or that but ready to drive
me
crazy as you can see here I have
generously flowed
off this chopped
chuck all right the next St put some
cooking oil in here we're going to be
using some sunflower
oil put in about one tablespoon
just to put on the bottom of that
pan and a
half or anything I sure you so what
we're going to do is we're going to put
our stove on medium high heat we're
going to drop all of this
flour
Cut Beef into this pan and we're going
to Brown off this meat and we'll be
back all right let's give you a quick
rund down of the ingredients we've got
one red bell pepper cut up fairly fine
one white onion cut up fairly fine we've
got a glass of uh reasonable red
wine drinkable I might add barely I've
got a crushed up bay leaf I have some uh
celery
seed I have about 4 and 1/2 tablespoons
of sweet Hungarian paprika some tomato
tomato paste and a bit of petite cut
tomato along with some cracked black
pepper and some sea salt so we're going
to start this thing off here and show
you how we're going to combine these to
make our Hungarian
goulash all right we've nicely uh
browned off our
uh beef we'll go ahead and put in a uh I
don't know really decent Siz glass of
wine into that I say that's probably qu
around 6 oz and to that we will add our
red
pepper along with our white
onion give that a little stir to glaze
the bottom of that pan of smidge
all right as this is coming up to heat
we can go ahead and put in our
Hungarian
paprika I guess that's different than
Spanish paprika I thought paprika was
just paprika but uh it said spicy
Hungarian
paprika see that nice rich broth coming
in
there go ahead and plop the uh tomatoes
in there
we'll do our
uh
aromatics
and the bay leaf along with one
heaping tablespoon of tomato paste we're
going to go ahead and run off some
cracked black pepper into this nothing
too much for right now we're going to
add the last two ingredients which are
the
salt and the garlic
once this has been stewing for a while
so we'll give this one final
stir we're going to bring this up to
heat and then we will turn it down to
low for 2 hours and come back and take a
look at what we've got and it should be
pretty darn
good all right well I'll tell you what
this Hungarian goulash is looking good
looking good and what we're going to do
next is I've got about 4 and half five
cloves of garlic I've chopped up had a
little demonstration on the half clove
but it's uh been done now and then we're
going to put in some uh parsley and uh
now we'll do a little salting here we're
going to put in some of this Himalayan
sea salt I think it comes from the uh
edge of Mount Everest somewhere up there
nowhere near Hungaria but it still will
work I would say we put in about 3/4 of
a um tablespoon of that that and then of
course we'll round off a little bit of
the old uh black
pepper now we're going to turn this down
to real low and slow stir in this uh
salt I like to salt at the very end here
and then I'm going to
take all right well we're going to be
serving this Hungarian goulash uh
contrary to a lot of people's advice of
what they do we got some buili some
artisan buili we going to put into some
boiling water it's been salted and we're
going to cook this to the
manufacturers recommendation of 11
minutes cook it out of Dente and we'll
be
back all right folks we're about ready
to finish this one off we've just cooked
our pasta off Olive Dente and now we're
going to
add about
two
tablespoons of just regular full
strength sour cream to this give this
the little bit of
uh richness the the dish
deserves I'm sure you hungarians are
completely horrified at this point but
I'm hungry and I'm getting ready Dive
Right into this so we're going to take
this over to the sampling table and give
this dish a test it's Glen the ball chef
and we've just completed the Hungarian G
oh my gosh this stuff looks absolutely
fabulous may not be exactly what your
Hungarian grandmother made nor what your
high school cafeteria teacher put
together but this is
the Continental Cuisine version of this
European
Delight the red peppers the paprika I
mean all the spices just come together
with the sour cream and just make this
really quite magical I really want to
