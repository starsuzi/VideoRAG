hi guys I'm deina with forkin plate.com
and today we're going to show you two
ways to clean leaks now if you don't
know what a leak is it's the cousin of a
scallion looks like an you know a huge
scallion um it's a really sweet
delicious onion it's great for cooking
so sometimes they can be a little
difficult to clean because they Dre grow
this much underground so there's dirt
inside we'll show you how to do it so
what you want to do first you want to
take your knife and you want to cut off
the root end now we've already done it
here but you want to make sure the root
end is off you'll see that take it off
um and then you want to cut off these
green leaves here cuz these are pretty
tough and you don't really want to eat
them now if you're going to sauté your
leaks and you want to cut them you're
going to cut them in half like
this just like this and then you just go
ahead and give them a chop
here like so and then to wash them
you're just going to put them in cold
water
and you're going to move them around
you're going to have a lot more than
this but you're going to move them
around so that you get all the sand out
in between all the
layers okay so once you submerge them in
cold water you want to take them
out and just dry them off if you're
going to sauté them because you don't
want them wet if you're going to add
them to some sort of oil or fat or
butter so just make sure you dry them
off and remove them from the water don't
pour the water over them because all the
sand will be on the bottom and you don't
want to get that in your food so let me
show you the second way to clean leaks
now you want to take your leak again
you're going to cut off the root you're
also going to cut off the
top now if you want to keep them whole
you're going to slice them in half like
this and then you're just going to wash
in between all these layers here because
in between you can see there'll be sand
all in here and you want to make sure
you get all of that
out that's how you a
leak now I have to take a
leak I really do have to take a Le
