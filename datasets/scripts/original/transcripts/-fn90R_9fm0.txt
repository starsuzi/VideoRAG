hi guys I'm back with another DIY video
today I'm going to be showing you how to
make these Frosty glitter votives these
are super easy to make and you probably
have most of the stuff to make these
just laying around the house so let's
just go ahead and jump right into
it the first thing that you're going to
need is some type of An Empty Glass jar
I'm just using an old Bath & Body Works
Candle
jar next you're going to need some Mod
Podge some glitter I'm going to be using
two different shades of glitter just to
kind of give it a little bit of a cooler
effect so first of all I'm going to be
using some of this gorgeous gold chunky
glitter and then I am also using some of
this pink glitter but you can use any
colors that you like I just really love
the way these two look
together you're going to need a craft
paint brush and lastly some type of a
small container to mix everything up
in to get started I am adding some of my
gold glitter into this little
container this gold glitter is so pretty
I love glitter so much and then I am
adding in some of the pink glitter and
now I'm just shaking it all up mixing it
up and look how pretty that
looks next I took some of my mod podge
and I used a popsicle stick and added it
in with the glitter you just want to get
enough in there so it's kind of a thick
pasty
consistency you're also probably going
to want to set down a piece of newspaper
or a magazine when you're doing this
just in case you make a mess like me
sometimes I do spill some of this stuff
and then you're also going to want
something for this to sit on and dry
when you are finished okay now time for
the fun part so all you're going to do
is dip your craft paint brush into your
mixture and you are just going to begin
applying it onto your empty jar and I'm
just just kind of doing it in padding
motions hopefully you can tell by this
clip and if you have any spots where you
don't get enough you can always go back
over it or you can wait until it dries
and do a second coat I only ended up
doing one coat on mine and I really like
the way it came out just because you can
kind of see through it and gives it that
Frosty
look so you're just going to continue
doing this around the whole jar just try
to make sure you do a nice thin even
layer and this whole project probably
took me
maybe I want to say 5 minutes it was
really quick and easy to
make and after that you are finished now
you're just going to set this aside to
dry it probably takes at least 2 to 3
hours to dry
completely once you are finished you can
go ahead and add a tealight candle or a
flameless candle if you like these look
Gorge gorgeous either way they look so
pretty lit up they also look pretty when
they are not so here is just what it
looks like a little bit of a
closeup if you guys have any questions
about anything just let me know like I
said these are super easy to make and
most of you probably already have the
stuff laying around your house to be
able to make them I hope you guys
