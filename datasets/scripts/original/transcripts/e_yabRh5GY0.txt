hey guys this Chris with the gorilla
gunfighter and today I'm going to show
you what I do for a job I'm a land
surveyor and so there's not going to be
no explosions no guns no knives no
killing stuff so if uh that's what
you're looking for you might want to go
check somewhere else but if you want to
learn how to set up a GPS base as a land
surveyor have I got a deal for you so
just check it
out all right go briefly over the
equipment um
GPS head that's the base head uh GPS
base extension the Rover
head we have a radio and our whip
antenna and the tri bra which I'll show
you here in just a second measuring
sticks battery to power the base and the
radio all my antenna and radio whips are
in here and our power cables and
additional
antenna we have our legs and a tri bra
the legs are sented over this which is a
control Point pin this just happens to
be control Point
23 this pin was previously set up a
couple months ago and it is used to
triangulate the this exact position to a
thousandth of a centimeter um so you can
get accurate GPS
triangulations this thing is a tri bra
and it's screwed on here this is what
holds the base head
and you use this Bubble Level which
right now isn't very level and you look
through this Optical
plummet I don't know if you'll be able
to
see very
clearly there's the pen it's not very
clear through that um but this you be
you're looking at this pin through that
Optical plummet and you're want to get
it
exactly in the center which is that
little indentation right
there and uh you level it up keep
leveling the legs and get this level and
once everything's leveled up then you
start putting your equipment on there so
I'm going to go ahead and do that now so
let's uh get you guys set up here
hopefully uh sound and everything will
be good and there will be some
background noise of course I am outside
I'm off of Main Road in the middle of
nowhere uh
so uh let's keep guys set up on
this
tripod all
right and there's my ugly mug and
there's
the legs so we're going to go aad and
get the base set
up so try to get it
centered over there make small
adjustments once you're
close you step on the
legs you get them in
there of course this is you know
throwing my Optical off so I have to
readjust using the legs look at this
bubble and start leveling it
out move these things a little
bit that
one this leg right
[Applause]
here and and we'll do this one right
here and that should get
us pretty damn close now I'm going to
loosen the optic or the plummet and
Center it on the indentation on that
pin
so it's just that little bit and now I
am perfectly Center on
that and now I'm going to use these
adjustment dials to really dial it in
to where my bubble is completely
centered and it is and that's that
now Sor to go off
camera
get our
base extension
up that goes on our Tri
Brack triack top comes off you screw
that that deal
in
then going to get this on there and
double check makees your Center see
that's why you double check as you're
moving this thing around it'll come
off
center so you want to keep double
checking as you're messing with
it
and get one of our
cables this is that y splitter cable
that that goes from from the base to the
radio to the
battery and this
side what goes underneath your base head
to provide
power the power is provided by that car
battery they can put other smaller
batteries in this thing uh but it's not
as effective as a car battery so uh
that's what we
use then grab the
radio and this is your radio it's a
trimble trar radio uh no big
deal and this
sits nicely right here do it gently to
try not knock
The Sing
Off Cable
in that's that and again I'm going to
check and recheck my zero or my uh sorry
my uh pin to make sure it's still Center
and put
radio battery right
here drop this car battery up
here this is my radio cable it's going
to go from a radio to my antenna that
I'm about to put
up so let's
go ahead and attach my radio
cable on
here I'll go ahead and double
check yep still on there still good to
go so it should be good for the rest of
the
time grab my Rover
Out close this box up put it away
now
grab
holes and this is an extra long whip
antenna it's pretty long so we can reach
a decent way is as long as you're on a
general elevated position uh you want to
try to get on the hill somewhere
overlooking where you're going to be
doing your work or where you're going to
be surveying at that way you can
maintain radio line of sight uh
otherwise it it it bounces all around
and your calculations are going to be
off so try to maintain radio line as
side if you
can
and candy canes or extensions to get the
radio way up
there and these
just just screw in here I mean you want
to try to be gentle with the equipment I
mean it is really really expensive but
um
you really still just need to put it
together so and it didn't fall on
directions these damn poles sometimes
the threading is off um so you had to
label them and I had to I just didn't
listen to my own
instructions so if I can get this thing
thread in here we
go and this is going to be what our
green antenna is going to be attached to
so we're going put this on
here and'll put it I don't know probably
15 ft in the air which will give us
considering where we're working will
give us a pretty
considerable range on this radio at
least a couple miles but right now I'm
looking at where we're going to be
working at and it's not
even half a mile away so that'll be good
now on your whip you have this little
guy right here that's where you're going
to attach your cable
to the other end of your cable
rather and
that is this guy right here that I just
Tangled all the hell
so this on
here and get it good and
tight come on
all right now I might be out of frame
for a
minute got to get this radio up
here see what I
mean all right so that's up we attach
our leads to the car battery
and a radio just powered on double
check on a pin that's good Bubble Level
still
good power's
on what you want to look
for
is
on your
radio know if you guys can see that my
vest is sort of throwing the color off
but it says
uh device status battery
normal might be a little bit easy to see
here we go and you cycle through that's
going to be your frequency
station that's just data protocol radio
link rate for information
you're in a base Rover
mode the radios are the uh receiving
sensitivity is low which I'm not worri
about and transmit power is all the way
up that's what we need uh now we're
going to set get our Rover on it'll take
me just a second so you guys bear with
me go get the batteries for the
Rover
and back in just a
second
all right now let's grab wh
well oh there it is all right this is
your rhead let me turn around the VF
finer so I can see what's going on um
this is your rhead this is where all
your information is going to be
transmitted
from
and screw in whip antenna on
over a lot of antennas a lot of screwing
stuff in a lot of whips and cords and
cables and everything else uh and it
just takes these little pack batteries
lithium ion
batteries just drops in right
there drops in that and that goes back
right there
so make sure it's on there
and make sure it's working and it is
lights are coming
on so let this sit there for the time
being now one thing we got to do is got
to measure the
height Bas we do that with those
measuring sticks they just it's like a
tin pole it just it
expands and it has
measurements all
along either side of it hopefully you
guys can see those um and just drop it
right in the center of that
pin and you measure it to the
center of your base head it's called the
center of
bumper
so right now I am
at
5 two 5.2 ft or 5.2 survey
feet uh all survey measurement and
Engineering measurements are
intense so there's no 3/4 of an inch any
that stuff it's all intense T and
hundreds of you know a
foot
so let's see we got measuring sticks are
done with this
way this goes back to the
truck and
now comes sort of the not really
complicated part but the more in depth
part is your data collector just a big
handed deal I'm sure you guys have seen
uh seen people use these before um yeah
the dude's walk around with the poles on
the side of the road doing land survey
stuff usually on streets um I really
don't do local stuff it's all cross
country things like that right now the
project we're on is a 187 Mile Line from
uh Wheeler Texas to Ringold Oklahoma
it's I it's about 187 around 190 miles
uh so it's a long ways and uh good
paying job but some days it's kind of
boring other days it's real
hectic because everyone needs and
everyone needs your your measurements
and it has to be exact you're dealing
with high press pipe stuff that's
traveling you know products usually be
gasoline or natural gas is traveling
through these pipes at around 3,000 you
know PSI so you need to know where your
welds are and you need to know what your
distance is from your top of the ground
to where your pipe is so that's your
ground cover uh you're lotted so much
ground cover you have to
know where your welds are in relation to
your next Weld and the weld in front and
the weld back so if they had to dig it
out they can pull up your old
information find exactly to the you know
tenth of a of a foot or 100th of a foot
uh where exactly that that that bad weld
or whatever is so we had to start a new
job on our collector I'm not going to uh
go through the different screens because
it's already going to be hard enough for
you guys to see this but you this is a
triple Access program for you guys and R
for you trle access is what we're using
uh used survey Pro before tremble aess
is a little bit easier um learning it's
tougher but it's it's a little more user
friend friend l once you get used to it
uh just start a new job and each job on
a pipeline has a different name this one
is 1421 01 and then we use today's date
which is
3
[Music]
244 HW going
crazy um that's other cool thing about
this job of course you're outside all
the time which is awesome but you see a
lot lot of stuff that you wouldn't
otherwise see if you were in town deer
all over the place here got skunks
everywhere I don't know what it is about
this place and stun they're all over the
place doesn't stink as well as you know
you would think if you never smelled one
of course me being from
Georgia uh it smells like
a almost like a like burning rubber just
a real Sour kind of smell real bad Bo so
uh
anyway we start measure rtk I'm not
going to try to explain what rtk is you
start your base receiver that's the base
Receiver right there that we set up and
measure and this my collector is likeing
the Bluetooth to base
receiver you're waiting for it to do
that it takes it a minute or
two there it
goes and your point name this point is
is
cp23 it's already in here so I just type
in 23 it automatically goes to that
antenna height
5.20 and to the center bumper and start
simple as
that Bas started that's what I need now
I'm going to set up Bluetooth from
rhead do that almost the same thing I'm
going to go to measure rtk measure
points now it's Bluetooth to my Rover
head so let's see here set my Rover head
up real
quick and this is just a 2 m Rover pole
uh it's got a bubble level on
it see right there uh and it extends out
we're just going to send it up a little
bit just so I can screw this thing on
here
sleep right here so you guys can see
this all right and we're getting radio
from our base so we
set and show you on these buttons right
here these lights on this
head here we go this means you got power
running off your Bluetooth
incorrectly you have access to your
satellites and this is your radio you're
getting radio signal so that's what you
want all three of those lights on and
the middle one blinking and satellite
blink as well so right now I have 16
satellites in
view
that'ss off of I'm just going to adjust
my antenna height which is this to 2
m which is 6.5 62 ft and that's going to
be two the bottom of the antenna mount
which is right here and and that is
essentially it I am going to turn off my
auto store which that means if I hit
enter on this thing and it takes a GPS
you know coordinate or GPS location that
shot it automatically stores it well I
don't want it to do that I want to be
able to hit store and it asks me for
attributes so if I'm taking a shot on a
weld and I hit store it brings up an
attribute list it says you know I can
name it a weld and I can call it a
automatic weld or a robotic weld or a
manual weld or you know handmade you
know human
weld but there's a bunch of different
attributes there's hundreds of them and
each company you work for or each job
you do will usually have different
attribute lists they vary slightly uh
but for the basic stuff uh roads uh
power lines that sort of stuff it's uh
it's going to be the same across the
board so guys that is it in a nutshell
what I do for my day-to-day
job um I enjoy it it pays really well
which definitely helps in the enjoyment
Factor uh but uh you know I don't plan
on doing this rest of my life I really
you know would like to get a couple
years in save up a bunch of money and
then do something else so uh anyway uh
don't forget to like share and subscribe
um if you guys have any questions just
let me know I'll try to answer them and
um you know any video suggestions of
stuff you guys want to see especially
any of you survey guys since I'm doing
that most of the day is a lot easier for
me to do survey videos right now U I'll
try to get knock out a knife video so
stay tuned for that and uh you know
appreciate the the support you guys have
a good
one
