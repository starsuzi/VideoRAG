everybody has a problem with crown
molding but this is a nice simple detail
quarter round detail I like this detail
with this trim that you have around your
doors it's nice and simple i' be more
than happy to help you with this but to
get started I want to run a straight
line around the room to set our crown
molding tube I'm going to Mark Each
corner using a scrap piece of crown
molding holding it at the right
orientation
I then connect the lines together using
a white chalk line because the white
chalk will remove
easy right there okay here it
goes we're going to start installing the
crown molding on the front wall now it's
going to require two pieces of crown
moldy so what I want to do is I actually
want to put a scarf joint or a miter
joint in the middle so I'm going to take
my first piece and I'm going to put it
in the corner just holding it tight I've
marked a position where our stud is in
the wall and I'm just going to put a
mark about where my center of my stud is
I'm going to miter this first
piece okay this is the saw that I'm
going to use to make all of the cuts in
the room now the first thing I want to
show you is the orientation that the
molding will sit in the room it's like
this this being the wall this being the
ceiling but I don't want to cut it
holding it in this orientation what I
want to do do is I want to flip it over
like this put it on the
saw now when I hold it against the saw
this is the ceiling and this is the wall
now why do you do it this way well
because now I have more points of
contact and I can actually hold it
better so it's safer so now when I turn
my saw or tilt it to 45° I can make my
cut
[Applause]
all right now we're ready to put our
first piece up and I'm actually going to
nail it to the
wall but the first thing I want to do is
find the
stud right there so I'm going to take
the molding put it tight into the corner
now I want to take the bottom of the
molding and put it on our white
line like
that so I'll na my first stud right
there
now I'm going to nail into the ceiling
also now when I nail into the ceiling I
don't have to worry about finding a stud
or any structure because there's
actually blocking between the joist and
also one parallel with the
wall so now what I want to do is I want
to take this end of it and I want to
slide it up so the bottom of the crown W
and hits the white line right there and
that will make the bottom of the crown
wolding straight around the Rope
we're use an 18 gauge finish nailer with
a 2in
nail okay now I got to push this Ming up
to the
line right there now I'm going to nail
it okay now I want to get a length for
this piece right here so we'll just hold
that up in the corner I'll push it to
you and I'm going to get a length right
there okay now my SAR is still set on
45° when I cut the first piece of
molding that we put up I cut it from
this side of the saw now I have to cut
this molding on this side of the saw so
my two cuts will be parallel to each
other
[Applause]
just dry fit
it okay that looks that looks good now
what I want to do first is I want to
glue the joint
push it right
up okay push it to me a little bit oh
not too
much okay nailing
it and that's how you make a scarf
joint and now we'll just nail the rest
of the molding
off all right now let me show you how
I'm going to deal with the corner now
some people will each piece like this
it's a 45° angle here and a 45° angle
here making a 90° corner you don't have
a 90° angle the piece won't fit tight
together I would have to BCT this angle
so whatever that degree is I would have
to cut equal degrees on each piece now
the other thing you got to worry about
is when the wood dries out as it dries
out it shrinks and the joint can open up
to lessen that problem what I like to do
is do a butt cut in the corner as we did
and a miter on the next piece now if you
see when I put it up it won't fit tight
so what I have to do is remove all of
this material in the back down to the
painted Edge now to remove the wood in
the back I'm going to use this saw right
here it's a coping saw blade it's a
small blade making a curv
cut just going to follow the Leading
Edge on the paint
let's see how it
fits try it right up there like that I
just hold that on up there Patrick don't
push it up tight just let me position it
all right I put it right into the corner
like that now that fits pretty
good okay so now before I F passing it
into place I'm going to put some cocking
in behind here what's the for well
it's going to fill any imperfections in
that
cut so we'll have a nice tight
corner now I'm going to tack it in
place now we'll just keep working our
way around the room
[Music]
now take a look at your miter first make
sure it's tight once it's tight inhale
it perfect you're good already see
that
[Music]
good all right now I need to cut an
outside corner for for the piece that's
going to go over the brick to do that
I'm going to set my saw on a 45°
angle I'm going to here's my length
right
there all right now that's the piece
that's going to go in front of the
fireplace that's one okay now I'm going
to turn my saw the other direction at
45° cut the other piece of molding for
the end of the fireplace
[Music]
[Applause]
I'm going to pre-assemble the two pieces
down here and then I'm going to install
it as
one I'm using construction adhesive
along the bottom of the back of the
crown molding to fasten it to the brick
then I'll nail it to the ceiling
all right guys your crown molding is all
done now there's a couple of things I
want you to do I want you to around
the top of the crown molding where it
meets the ceiling and also where it
meets the wall to fill in those voids
fill all the nail holes sand it lightly
and paint it I think I can handle that
okay
