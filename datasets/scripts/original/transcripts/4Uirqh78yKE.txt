hi everybody it's Kim from Made by Mommy
and today I'm going to teach you how to
make a really quick and easy Pokeball is
that how you say it Poke Ball Pokeball
you guys can tell me in the comments
below uh inspired by the new app Pokemon
go which both Claire and I are playing
with great enthusiasm to make the
Pokeball you'll need eight black 10
white and eight red
to begin take a single black loom
band wrap it around your hook it can be
either the hook that came with your
Rainbow Loom kit or any basic crochet
hook and twist it around twice so that
you then see three loops on your hook
then take two white at a time hold it
tight push that tripled over black loom
band to the center of those two
bands and fold over so that both sides
are on the hook then
add two more white
bands and another
two
and two more
again so that you have that shape and
then bring the tip of your hook back
into that original black band so that
you can begin to make the center black
row you're going to pull two black bands
through that initial
I tripled over band like
that and then you're going
to take another two black bands pull
them through but before returning them
onto your hook we want to make that
little white dot that goes in the center
of the ball to do that take two white
bands that you have
left and twist them over your hook
twice then we're going to return the
other half of the black loom
band now we're going to take two black
loom bands and pull them straight
through both of the black pairs of bands
and all of those white Loops that are in
the
center
this is the trickiest step of the whole
project like
that then you can
return so that you have both sides of
that pair of black bands on your hook
and you'll see that white dot for the
center is now
connected and now we're ready to create
our red row
to do that go back into the original
tripled over black
band and we're going to put four pairs
of red bands on in a
row so that's
one again we're putting two at a
time that's the second
pair
two
more and two more
again and then you have just one black
band
remaining you're going to take that
single black
band and pull it straight through all of
those
Loops put both sides of the rubber band
on your hook and we're going to create a
slip knot by pulling this side of the
rubber band through the center of this
side so I
twist and pull through and then give it
a little bit of tug to secure and now
you have your very
own Pok ball Poke Ball Pok ball poke
poke ball I don't know you guys tell me
how to say it down below and let me know
if you're playing Pok√©mon go and what
your level is I think it's such a fun
game and uh I'm so excited to be able to
merge my love of loom bands with my love
of that new app thanks again for

with a friend so that I know you want to
see me make even more looming videos and
if you want to see more designs the best
way to find all of the tutorials that
