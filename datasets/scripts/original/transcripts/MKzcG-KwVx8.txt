I'm working on a 2003 Kia Spectra the
problem is the brake pedal goes straight
to the floor
it appears
somebody tried to address this problem
with the new master cylinder that looks
brand new
I filled the cylinder
reservoir with brake fluid
and the brakes came back but all the
fluid shortly thereafter leaked out near
the center of the car which led me back
here to this problem there's this
proportioning valve is is covered with
brake fluid there's some kind of leak
right here so the next step is to remove
some of the stuff that will be in my way
and then we'll take it off and replace
it
[Music]
I put the light
by the proportioning valve so it'll be
easier to see
it's just soaked
so what I'm going to do next is put a
drain pan underneath and I'll clean it
off so I can see what I'm doing
disconnect all the fittings and just
remove it I'm attempting to remove this
with a regular 10 millimeter combination
wrench instead of a tubing wrench
so far so good first one although it was
tight came was I was able to loosen it
okay number two
is good
I was able to loosen three of the six
bolts with a standard 10 millimeter
combination wrench
the other three wooden budge so I'm
going to have to buy a 10 millimeter
tubing wrench
I bought a 10 millimeter tubing wrench
let's see if we can get those others
three loosened up
so let's see if we have any better
success with this
type of wrench pretty tight
my goodness okay let me try one of the
other ones
go back to that
it's not budging
okay I'm gonna put some panipating oil
on this
okay now I've loosened all the bolts or
all the Fasteners the
first to
the PB Blaster penetrating oil really
did the trick and I was able to loosen
the third one
even with the PB Blaster on there I
could feel that
it was going to round the
hex shape of the Fastener so I tried
tightening it to see if I could break it
Loose that way and that worked
I just tightened it a little bit and
that it gave way
kind of with a loud snap
didn't break it just broke loose and
then I was able to loosen it just fine
so everything's loose I'm going to take
this out put in the new ones before I go
any further I'm just going to wash the
PB Blaster off
I don't want that to get mixed up with
the brake fluid
is this brake clean
okay back to taking it apart
okay
I don't know why it was leaking but
I'm gonna take a close look at it and
see if I can figure it out the only
thing that looks suspicious is this
piece right here so
there is evidence of
wetness there so
whatever this vent
hole is or whatever this however this
works looks like that was leaking right
there because all the pipes were tight
and everything else looks good so
something internally was making it leak
out of that hole this is the new one all
I need to do is put it in place
and then tighten everything up and bleed
the brakes there are
six brake lines going in here and
there are two Fasteners that bolted to
the firewall
that's all there is
in before I tighten before I mounted it
into the firewall I got all the tubing
fittings started then I screwed it to
the firewall and then tightened them up
and now it's just a matter of filling up
the
master cylinder with brake fluid and
bleeding the system
