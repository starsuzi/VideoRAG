okay let's talk about the categories
petroleum based oils and so forth
biological protein synthetic dyes
organic and other it's always other
category one which is petroleums we want
to dissolve
it what does it take to dissolve an
oil some kind of solvent not water
obviously
ly we need to break it down we need to
emulsify it so we can extract it out
let's see what we take things stuff like
this we're going to get into virtually
all of
these stuff like
this if it's just plain oil WD40
whatever just safety
solve but safety solve the big thing is
you always apply to safety solver any
strong solvent while wearing solvent
resistant rubber gloves don't do what
chemists do to a white towel and you
block with it you never pour it directly
on to the carpet why would you never
pour a really strong solvent directly
onto the carpet
yeah you're going to delaminate about
15% of the weight of your carpet is dirt
from the factory when you pull up the
carpet what do you find all that gritty
stuff where'd that come from it's the
backing falling apart so if this is
glorified Elmer's glue mix that with a
really strong solvent what are you going
to end up doing you're going to dissolve
the
glue if there's a danger of spreading it
olve with Pro solve gel Power Gel fer
suspension and extract over what's all
this about oh let me find some stuff
here's some pool gel Power Gel when I'm
talking to you on the phone I can never
remember which is which I just say the
stuff in the yellow tube the stuff in
the black
too we' got some used crank case on it
nice and
black how do that
look now I understand why every time I
check the oil level is got more oil in
there there's gasoline in there too I
think I have a little
problem prol gel is the first one what
prosolve gel is is a solvent and a
thickening agent put on here first so we
can see it
better why would I want a thickening
agent why would I I want it
thick yeah so I agitate this with carpet
chart or we could do the carpet cleaner
technician job with our fingernail which
is
stupid
right Power Gel what Power Gel is is if
I just simply extract this right now
what's going to
happen and this I've got oil I've got
solvent do oils and solvents like
water so I've got to add something to
this to make the oil and the uh uh
solvent like water that's what an
emulsifier is that's what booster is
it's mostly emulsifier it's thick also
for the same reason oh let's do it
legitimately instead of with a
fingernail agitate that in then we can
extract it do it on
this now watch me not get be able to get
that
out agitate it in leave it for a
while extract it
[Music]
out
and we get the oil
out that's how we deal with that of
course that was fresh but
still now normally where would most of
that have
been even even when they messed with it
where's it going to be it's going to be
down in here so what's the last thing I
need to do with this spot yeah I would
put stain blad on that and that way any
oil that comes up is going to be in the
stain blot the customer can vacuum it
tomorrow you would call which means
anytime you tell the customer something
about tomorrow what does that
say you pick up the phone and you call
her
right how did did did you vac did you
vacuum it up was it all gone if not you
need to do
what go
back be always be proactive you know
just because the customer doesn't call
you
if here's what a custo typical customer
does she's very upset she doesn't call
you she just happens to tell her hundred
best friends about what an awful
horrible company you have and what you
did to her and so on and so forth that's
called negative advertising that's
something you don't want you spend a lot
of money advertising you don't want
somebody out there undoing you and who
has the greater
credibility the customer has the better
credibility not you you're you're
probably somebody who's ripping off
people you are a businessman so
obviously you're you're a rip off artist
a crook uh but she she we believe
her so Pro solve gel the stuff in the
yellow tube Power Gel that's that's a
thick solvent that's a thick emulsifier
you mix the two
extract there are some that are very
difficult to remove for that we have
prosolve liquid sometimes safety solve
and these don't get it prosolve liquid
flam extremely
flammable turn off all sources of
ignition stoves electric motors etc etc
etc what this contains now that I'm
remembering from the material safety
data sheets one of the main ingredients
in here is something called acetone
great stuff
as well as several others and I don't
even
remember I'm just going to squirt some
on
here there you
go don't take too big a whiff of
that it smells a lot like fingernail
polish remover doesn't
it it is extremely good for glue
tar chewing gum tree sap shoe
polish if that safety solve isn't
getting it that
will by the time it gets back to the
back that probably will have already
evaporated yep and we're we're going to
I got think I got some carpet over there
with nail polish on it everything over
there that's wrapped up I I did a week
or two ago
safety Sal the good thing about it is is
nonflammable unlike that stuff but it's
still a solvent don't Breathe
It here's Kevin showing you back when it
was in gallon jugs put it onto the uh
towel and blot with it of course not
wearing rubber
gloves
