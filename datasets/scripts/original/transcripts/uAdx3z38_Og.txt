Hey guys!
I hope you are fine & doing well.
Its wednesday and i'm gonna show you
five different methods of blending graphite pencils
so after watching this video
 let me know in the comments
which one you are currently using 
& which one you like the most
First of all we have this synthetic watercolor brush
and the manufacturing company is BOMEJIA
I have these 5 different sizes of these brushes
and i use all of them in my hyperrealistic drawings
Secondly, we have this paper stump of size #4
and is manufactured in a local company in pakistan
i also have 6 different sizes of these stumps
Third tool for blending is a Cotton-bud
also known as Q-tip
I also use cotton bud as a tool for blending
4th one is an ordinary pocket tissue
and i mostly use them in background of my artworks
Now the 5th one is my own HAND
you must be thinking that i'm joking
but actually i'm a self-taught artist 
& when i started drawing a few years ago
I was unaware of these tools
so i used my fingers for blending
for about three to four months
So i think its a better alternative for all the other tools
Anyways, lets compare
 all these tools by blending some shades
I'll be using this B pencil for shading
lets add 5 consecutive shades for each tool
First of all i'm going to blend with brush
Now blending with a paper stump
now blending this one with a cotton bud
now using the tissue paper
and the final one which is, blending with a finger tip
Now as we have all these 5 results in one place
I think these 3 tools are better than the others
we got this super smooth result from tissue paper
and also from brush and finger
and we got this textured result from blending stump
and also from this Q-tip
Anyways, i hope you got an idea of each tool
and you can use whatever you want
