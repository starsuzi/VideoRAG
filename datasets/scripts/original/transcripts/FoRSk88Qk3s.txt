today we're going to take off the shell
of an egg without taking off the entire
thing here's how you do it you take an a
full glass of vinegar make sure you put
a little just so that it doesn't stink
up the entire room and you of course you
need an
egg you have to take an egg and put it
in the vinegar
the reason I use vinegar is because if
you use any other liquid it won't
dissolve the calcium chloride in on the
shell of an
egg but vinegar has athetic acid which
dissolves the calcium chloride on the
egg keep it for a few days it'll take a
long while don't expect it to be
overnight if you keep on make sure you
cover it with a plastic covering just so
that it doesn't stick up in the entire
room if you know moms if it stinks up
the entire room she's going to kill you
so just when you're done taking air
freshener and put it around the room
just so that it doesn't smell like
acid once you do that after a few days
it shall look like this
isn't that really cool it like bounces
everywhere it
goes look at it as you can see there is
no shell if there is just wipe it
off it's this is the membrane I did
not boil it or do anything with it I
just put it in the
vinegar now you can see it's very bouncy
and it's very
squishy as my dad turns off the lights
and you will be able to
see the magic
happen all you need is a
flashlight and you need the
egg you take the egg and put the
flashlight behind it and you can see the
yolk
this Yol is really cool you can scare
your friends at Halloween have fun with
