2015 is Scotland's year of food and
drink a year celebrating Scotland's
natural ladder and world class Cuisine
this month we're celebrating summer
berries and
[Music]
fruits during the summer months Scott's
alive with berries and they pair really
well with Scottish pancakes you're going
to need granulated sugar strawberries
blackberries raspberries milk chocolate
chips flour heavy cream an egg baking
powder salt sugar some lemon juice mint
leaves and some melted
butter okay first we're going to start
with the pancake batter we've got our
flour going to mix all the dry
ingredients together got a little bit of
salt some
sugar and our baking
powder okay then we're going to crack
our egg
going to mixx that up add our
milk and add our melted
butter so we add that to the
flour until it's a nice smooth
consistency okay it's
good so we're going to get started with
making the chocolate ganache really
really straightforward pour our cream
into a pan we've got that in a medium to
high heat when it gets the simmering
point we're just going to turn it off
all together okay so it's just at
simmering point we're going to turn this
off now just add our
chocolate and just let it sit for a few
minutes okay while the uh ganache is
tempering we're just going to get the
 started again we're going to get
this on a medium to high heat it's going
to be a mixed berry we're going
to add some
strawberries some raspberries a lemon
juice a touch of sugar I'm we going to
let that go for about 5 minutes
just been there for about 5 minutes you
can see it's really coming together
we're going to stir this and make sure
it's nicely tempered but it's looking
lovely it's got a lovely Sheen to it
nice and
bright okay so mixed berry cool has been
simmering for about 10 minutes or
so we've got a lot of raspber in there
so it's really important to strain it at
this point so you've got a really nice
product in the end you see how nice and
clear that is just a nice use of local
Scotti
ingredients so we're wa to make our
pancakes using a little bit of sunflower
oil the reason we're using that is it's
really good for high
heat we're going to keep it this side
down probably for about 2 or 3 minutes
basically until it's almost cooked all
the way through all right the speed's
been this side for about 2 minutes these
Scottish pancakes often referred to as
drop scon are just the easiest things to
make they're just
lovely so we have the uh pancakes
finished the chocolate ganache the mixed
berry and we're just going to
start putting this together so just
going to put a little bit of
the mixed berry on the
bottom and add our first pan
Kake just add another
layer and then
again you add another layer
okay we're just going to add a little
bit more around the
outside add our nice mixed
berries going to finish it the chocolate
ganache powder
sugar pram
mint and there we have a nice take on
traditional Scottish pancakes and mixed
