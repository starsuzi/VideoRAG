Hello friends!
My name is Jenny, and today we are making
a simple chocolate syrup and using it in a
cookies and cream milkshake.
This is a quick and easy way to get some chocolate
syrup that doesn't a bunch of unnecessary
ingredients in it.
All of the ingredients will be listed down
below.
You will need
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/3 cup maple syrup
1/2 tsp vanilla
dash salt
3/4 cup water
To a saucepan, add the water, maple syrup,
salt, and cocoa.
Put the fire to meadium heat and stir in the
cocoa, pressing out any clumps.
Let it come to a boil, stiring often to not
let it burn.
When it reaches a boil, turn the heat down
and let it simmer for one minute, while regularly
stirring.
After one minute, turn off the heat and add
the vanilla.
This syrup must be stored in the fridge.
To make the cookies and cream milkshake
Use two cups of vanilla ice cream, one cup
of milk (I'm using almond milk),
and 4-6 chocolate cookies with creamfilling,
just as oreos or Joe joes, from trader joes.
The amount will depend on the size of your
cookies and how many it takes to make it taste
good to you.
Make sure the syrup has cooled down enough
to not melt the milkshake too fast.
Add some syrup to your cup, then the milk
shake and some whipped cream, if you like.
And top it off with more chocolate syrup and
a couple cookies.
And there we have it, a really easy way to
make, and use, your own chocolate syrup.
Thank you for watching.
