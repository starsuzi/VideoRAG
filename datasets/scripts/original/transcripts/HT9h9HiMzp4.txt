hi i'm morgan bowling and today i'm
going to show you how to make bravlox
the perfect make-ahead party appetizer
first place a third cup of packed light
brown sugar and a quarter cup of kosher
salt in a bowl
mix these together until combined the
salt draws liquid from the fish and
cures it while the brown sugar counters
the harshness of the salt and adds a
deeper richer flavor
next drizzle three tablespoons of brandy
onto a one pound skin-on salmon fillet
if necessary spoon up any brandy in the
dish and drizzle over any spots you
missed the goal is to hit every part of
the filet with some moisture so that the
salt cure will adhere
using your hands rub the salmon evenly
on its top and sides with a sugar
mixture you want to really pack it on so
press firmly on the mixture so that it
adheres to the salmon
lastly top it off with a good thick
layer of chopped dill once you've added
all of the ingredients loosely cover the
salmon with plastic wrap don't make it
too taut just make sure the salmon is
completely covered
now place a square baking dish or pie
plate on top of the covered salmon then
place several large heavy cans in the
dish to weight it and move the whole
thing to the refrigerator
you need to refrigerate the salmon until
it feels firm about three days each day
remove the weights dish and plastic wrap
and baste the salmon with the liquid
released into the baking dish make sure
to hit every part of the dill with the
basting liquid so it looks thoroughly
moistened
if any of the dill swims off put it back
in place before reassembling and
returning it all to the fridge
after three days scrape the dill sugar
and salt off of the salmon a butter
knife works really well for pushing back
the dill without cutting into the fish
at this point the grout blocks can be
left whole and wrapped tightly in
plastic and refrigerated for up to one
week or you can dig in
remove the filet from the dish and place
it onto a cutting board make sure to pat
it dry with paper towels before slicing
using a long sharp knife
slice the salmon as thin as you can on
the bias don't cut through the skin
underneath this flap can be folded over
the remaining grout blocks to help keep
it fresh and moist
enjoy it on its own or with cream cheese
shallots or other accoutrement just make
sure to save some for your guests
