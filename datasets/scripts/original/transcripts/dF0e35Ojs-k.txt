oh no oh
no adult Eastern cic killer wasps are
large 1.5 to 5.0 CM 0.6 to 2.0 in Long
cic killer females use their sting to
paralyze their pre cicas rather than to
defend their nests unlike most social
wasps and bees they do not attempt to
sting unless hand L roughly adults feed
on flower nectar and other plants AP
exudates the male wasp's aggressive
behavior is similar to that of another
robust insect of the area the male
carpenter bee in both cases while the
male's vigorous territorial defense can
be frightening and intimidating to human
passers B the males pose no danger
whatsoever they will only gravel with
other insects and cannot sting oh sure
it cannot sting it can not sting
