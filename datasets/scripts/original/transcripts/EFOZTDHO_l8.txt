having your friends over for a fun
communal meal is the best and what's
even better is a meal where you don't
have to cook a damn thing now how's that
possible without ordering out you throw
a thai style barbecue hot pot night also
known as mukata which translates to pork
skillet and it's kind of like a korean
barbecue and japanese shabu-shabu all in
one during my last visit to thailand my
family invited me for my first ever
mukata and it was glorious they prepared
an assortment of proteins and veggies
and it was so fun grilling the meat and
dunking ingredients into this moat of
steamy soup underneath so i'm really
excited to show you how to prepare this
for yourself at home first up let's talk
about the dipping sauces now you could
buy these pre-made thai sauces in a
bottle but they're super easy to make on
your own my favorites are nam jim jiao
which is perfect for any thai barbecue
and num chim sea food that's how it is a
thai it's not the english translation
it's just nam jim seafood
for nam jim jiao combine lime juice
fish sauce and sugar
then add sliced shallots cilantro
dried ground thai chili
and toasted rice powder
like most of thai cuisine there's that
really nice balance of all the different
flavors so you got sour salty spicy
sweet and you gotta play around with it
depending on what your taste preferences
are you can add a little more spice a
little more sourness with lime juice
totally up to you for nam jim seafood
throw a bunch of garlic into a mortar
and pestle or food processor
followed by a bunch of cilantro the
leaves stem and even the root it's the
most flavorful part fish sauce
lime juice
sugar
then mix in some chopped thai chilies
you can add a little or a lot both of
these sauces really hit all the spots on
your tongue
i'm sorry i apologize for my behavior
for the veggie platter i've got an
assortment of delicious flavorful
ingredients like assorted mushrooms i've
got some sliced shitake and some enoki
when these hit either the grill or the
soup they release as a very deep meaty
flavor so freaking good along with some
sliced napa cabbage this just makes it
easier to pick up and cook some sliced
up chinese chives you can also use
scallions chinese broccoli again use any
other type of veggie you want along with
some cilantro for that herby freshness
and glass noodles for lovers of nudes
for the meat platter i have some ribeye
pork belly and pork gel that's the uh
meaty fatty part here if you notice they
all got a nice ratio of fat to meat and
that's because it's going to make it
super tender either on the grill or in
the soup and they're also very thinly
sliced now you could get them like this
at the asian market or you can get a
whole piece of meat freeze it a little
bit and then go ahead and slice it
yourself and then arrange it in a
platter just like this now the last
platter is the seafood one it's actually
my favorite i've got some clean squid
which i sliced into rings fish balls so
yummy i've got fish tofu squares here an
assortment of fish balls and some shrimp
i got them whole and i just removed the
skin but left the head and the tail
intact and the head is just delicious to
suck on right right you know what i'm
talking about this beauty right here is
my cooking device it's an electric
version of a mulkata now traditionally
they have the dome center plate just
like this for grilling and underneath
they heat it up with a lot of charcoal
now this is the electric version so i
have some switches here and i can
control the heat and around it is a
reservoir for the base of the soup and
all you have to do is add some hot water
you can add a flavored soup base if you
want but what i love about this is that
it starts off plain and then as you add
all the ingredients it just intensifies
the flavor of the soup it is so bomb and
for each person in your group give them
a plate a bowl with a spoon
and divide the sauce into their own
little individual bowls so that uh we're
not swap and spit you know i like to
start off by adding the veggies to the
water so you can start developing flavor
[Music]
some of those fish balls
the grill pan is nice and hot i'm going
to start off with my favorite some pork
chow
[Music]
and to sanitize your chopsticks just dip
them for a few seconds in the hot water
and keep cooking
[Music]
sometimes people like to marinate the
meat beforehand and then grill it but i
like it just plain because the sauces
are so flavorful my mouth is watering
i'm trying to keep grilling my mouth
let's try the seafood
oh yeah lots of chilies there
it's so refreshing the sauce prepared
with the seafood excellent if you don't
know how to eat shrimp at the head let
me show you you just twist off the body
hang on to this
dip that in the seafood sauce
[Music]
also dip the head use your teeth to kind
of grab everything into your mouth and
suck at the same time
heaven heaven
[Applause]
grab some soup
with some of those veggies
we have a sip of this broth it's been
building up some flavor
so
comforting i really hope you give this a
try invite your friends over let them do
the cooking for once see you next time
fish balls in my mouth
too hot too hot
