- What do you guys love
and what do you guys
hate about doing chores
and what can you pin
on your children?
(lips smacking)
Hey guys, welcome to Millennial Moms.
I'm Tay and that means it's Tuesday.
So, I designed these
autonomous chore cards.
I hope that doesn't
intimidate you that I used
a big word, but I did.
I've heard of a chore
chart but a chore card?
I designed them for boys and girls.
These are just the girl ones.
However, I'm gonna show
you guys how to make
them right now.
(upbeat music)
Okay guys, these chore cards
are created so that your
kids can do them themselves,
and the best part about
them is when the entire stack
of chores are flipped over,
it starts fresh over for the next day.
And there's no erasing,
there's no resetting.
That's all you have to do
and as long as all the chores
get done, your child
knows that they are done.
So, what we're gonna do
is print out the printable
that is in the description
below and get some laminate
and some scissors and hole
punches and you can use this
handy dandy cutter if you
wanted to, but you could
also just use scissors.
And we're gonna write
our child's name on them
and then cut all of these out.
All of these are chores that my kids do.
There is a blank one that
you can print out if you
want to make custom chores.
However, these are all
things that I'm pretty sure
most kids have to do.
So we're just gonna go ahead
and laminate them by using
self-laminating sheets
that I got at Hobby Lobby.
I cut all these out and
then I just put them between
two pieces of laminate,
cut them out so there's a
little extra piece of
plastic, and then I'm going to
arrange them by the time
and day of the chores
that my children have to do
what they're supposed to do.
This will allow so that
when they flip them over,
they have a consecutive day
and they just kind of get into
a routine, but it also will
allow the whole day to start
over because once they're
done flipping them all over,
it just starts over.
So they will flip and flip
and then it will go from
morning chores and then
every time they get done
with that section, it will
say good job, so they know
to put it back and come
back to it in the afternoon
or at night.
And then there is the
additional parts of the day
that you have extra things to
do, so things like vacuuming
the stairs or emptying out the shoe bins,
or everything that we do
but not needing to be done
everyday, I have an additional
little set for them to
get to their daily chore and
realize that that is what they
have to do on Monday or
Tuesday or Wednesday.
I hope you guys loved this tutorial.
