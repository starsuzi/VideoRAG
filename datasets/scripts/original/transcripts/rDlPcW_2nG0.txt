there's something very summery and very
english about cucumber sandwiches they
make up a perfect part of afternoon tea
along with scones clotted clotted cram
clotted cream and jam we're going to be
doing that a bit later um i love
cucumber sandwiches they're like a kind
of wisp-like confection you could have
them in between meals as a snack almost
so they kind of fill you up always white
bread this is actually slightly thicker
than i would like they didn't have
anything thinner the thinner the better
really because it looks a bit more
delicate the cucumber i always always
just gonna take the end off here
peel it because the skin actually is
quite bitter
normally when i have a cucumber in a
salad i even take the seeds out because
apparently they give you indigestion and
also they're quite watery you have to
make them just before you're going to
eat them otherwise they get a bit soggy
although the
butter unsalted butter we're going to
use because we're going to salt the
cucumber um
it acts as a barrier on the sandwich
to stop the bread getting soggy now
slice it very very thinly this is a
delicate thing so these have in the
victorian
times
okay
so it's complicated this one it's very
complicated recipe i really want you to
watch to the end because there's a trick
there isn't a trick
and then literally this is the tricky
bit
get the cucumber and put it on the
sandwich
two three wow
oops nearly forgot the salt this is um
sea salt um so it's quite big i'm just
gonna kind of
as it goes on
crunch it right down you could use table
salt but
we don't have any
don't you grab a couple of plates for me
see for kids party i might do those with
cream cheese yeah cream cheese is a good
addition but i just kind of think then
it becomes about the cream cheese and
not about the cucumber and this sandwich
is all about the cucumber look at those
dainty little confections
you can tell i used to work in the
sainsbury's coffee shop

triangles we'd love to hear uh we've
done a
cream tea session kind of things guns
