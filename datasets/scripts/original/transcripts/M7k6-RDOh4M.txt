Hello everybody welcome back this is
Sarah today I have another Build-A-Bear
Workshop toy for you guys this one is
called the spotted pup I don't know why
I always want to say that with a British
accent but I do anyway I thought this
dog was
adorable and so I found this at I
believe Toys R Us for about
$10 now I'll be using the Build-A-Bear
Workshop maker along with my refill kit
you don't necessarily need this to make
the spotted pup but it's always a lot
more fun and a lot like going to build a
bear let's see what they've included
inside of this refo kit you get some
awesome
stuffing that is like the softest
stuffing ever you get a Build-A-Bear
Workshop certificate there and some
punchouts those are made out of
cardboard and of course you get the
spotted
pup let's take our little puppy out oh
my gosh these are so soft oh look at
that face a this looks like a boy puppy
doesn't it a he is just so cute these
are really super easy to make you just
have to stuff them and then zip them
closed and then you're done also I can't
can't forget they've included one of
these Hearts which we're going to put
into our spotted pup before we zip them
up so let's go ahead and get started
first I'm going to carefully tear out my
little heart piece
here then on the inside I'm going to
write down a
wish let's see I
wish and I'm not going to tell you guys
because if I tell you then it's not
going to come true
now just carefully open up our heart
slip the wish on the
inside and now this is going to go
inside of our
puppy
perfect now you can always hand stuff
the puppy if you don't have one of these
Build-A-Bear machines but since I do
have one let's go ahead and do it this
way just open it up and put a whole
bunch of this stuffing
inside this is some really nice stuffing
it is so
soft now that all the stuffing is inside
we'll just put the lid back
on sometimes this could be the trickiest
part getting the little stuffed animal
onto the
machine okay I got it now we'll just
start turning the crank and watch our
spotted pup become full of
stuffing
oh
oh it's
overflowing I'm just going to use my
hands to push down all of the stuffing
into our spotted pups legs first
[Music]
now I'll start pushing the stuffing into
our puppy's
[Music]
head and last ly I'm going to use the
rest of the stuffing to fill up the
puppy's arms and body
[Music]
when you use up all of the stuffing last
step is just to zip the back
closed there now you're puppies oh he
isn't he just
adorable oh I must want to call him spot
