Now I'm going to talk about how to make the
cable crossing.
So this cable is crossing to the right.
Because the part of it that's on top is going
from the left to the right.
It's worked over one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight stitches.
And in order to create that effect, I need
to knit the stitches out of order.
So this is my cable needle.
You'll see what I do with that in a minute.
I'm going to work my way...ok so I knitted,
very often, cables will be bordered by purl
stitches on either side so they pop out of
the fabric.
So I worked up to the first stitch of my cable
and the cable crossing is worked every certain
number of rows depending on the pattern for
your cable.
So this one is every 8 rows.
And I have, so this is the stitch that joins
them.
So, that's one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.
So I'm ready for row 1 again.
And I'm going to bring the first four stitches.
I'm going to go slip them purlwise.
So I'm bringing the cable needle into each
stitch as if I was going to purl it.
I'll slip it onto the cable needle onto this
piece in the middle.
And bring it to the back and if I bring these
stitches to the back, It's going to cause
my cable to cross to the right.
I'm going to hold it parallel to my working
needle and knit the next four stitches.
So I'm knitting them out of order.
I'm going to pull that first stitch tight.
And now I am going to knit the four stitches
from my cable needle.
So I'm going to slide them to the other edge
of the needle and knit them off the end of
the cable needle.
Make sure they all slide on.
Now I'm done with that for now.
And you can see that it's curving in the same
direction.
So now I'm going to work on the back.
I'm going to work, purl the purl stitches.
If I see a purl stitch I'm going to purl it.
And if I see a knit stitch I'm going to knit
it.
So there's often a gap where you cross your
cable.
It doesn't mean that you did anything wrong.
It's just because you pulled things out of
order.
So now already it looks better with one row
but the pattern becomes more obvious as you
work.
And to turn the cable in the other direction,
you pull the held stitches towards you in
the front and that will turn your cable to
the left.
