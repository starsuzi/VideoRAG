our RV has pretty typical kitchen
sinks white Coran if you have this type
of sink you've probably also seen that
over time white Coran as easy as it is
to take care of tends to
discolor we normally keep the cover on
our smaller sink and you can see here
that the larger sink is much more
discolored now recently we've
intentionally been leaving things in the
sink that tend to discolor it like tea
bags fresh fruit other things that uh
have a lot of pigment to them that tend
to stain the reason we did that is so
that it would be really clear on video
how badly discolored it is you can
definitely see how bad the staining has
gotten you can try using just about any
cleaning product on here even Comet or
other abrasive
cleaners won't get the discoloring out
of the sink we used to
try bleaching the
Coran which works pretty well but it
smells terrible and we'd rather not use
bleach and we have a quick tip today on
what we now do to whiten our Coran RV
sink start by filling the sink with hot
water
once you've got an inch or two of water
in the bottom of the
sink pour in one scoop of
oxyclean
and just mix it around to start it
dissolving while we're doing the big
sink we might as well brighten up the
small sink too for the small sink you
can use about a half a scoop
if your sinks are older and really
stained up the sides up toward the top
of the sink you can fill the sinks
completely with water and just use more
oxyclean accordingly now just let that
sit for an hour or two after an hour or
two just let the water out and just
rinse out the
sink both sinks are now bright
white you can see that all the stains
are completely
gone stains from tea or blueberries or
any other really difficult stain will
come right out obviously this will work
on any white Coran sink not just one in
an
RV so if you have Coran sinks in your
house obviously you can use it there too
oxyclean is also a great laundry booster
just put between a quarter and a half a
scoop in the washing
machine and it'll help get your clothes
bright and clean
