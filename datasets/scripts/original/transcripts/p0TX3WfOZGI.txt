finally getting this frame upholstered
it's time to move on with some inner
spring cushions
I'll start by measuring out for some
burlap panels to cover these Springs now
a couple inches for each side looks like
25 by 34 I cut the burlap panels with a
selvage edge on on the ends going to
start by folding that over on the bias
it works out good about 1 and 3/4 inches
to take up a pleat here
back on this plea just a little bit so
with the Hamel way back flat turn these
back and match up the salvaged ends
start sewing the two panels together got
the machine set on a small stitch since
s is such a loosely woven material won't
really go under a lot of stress though
match up these corner pleats and snug it
up so on around the corner
okay I'll turn this out and insert the
spreads
around in a little corner here to go
back into that crevice this 32-inch
pattern repeat has been brutal on my
layout I've got nearly three and a half
yards of fabric to work with here
and because I've got a 34 inch panel
with a 32 inch repeat I'm not able to
make a seam allowance between the two
cushion lay this cushion face over the
fabric and match up the pattern I'll lay
out the boxing for the cushion make my
seam allowance I've got one inch up
above the line it doesn't hurt to do
these marks in several places sometimes
the pattern might crawl a little bit it
looks like these marks are all running
pretty straight so I'll scrub this off
with a long straight edge
using this cord around the corner
allowing about a quarter-inch makes the
corners finish off a lot nicer
hell overlap these about an inch trim
them off
please back
run out a few threads
turn these ends back and take up a half
inch scene
pull this panel back and
lay the two chords together
trim them right here at the seam line so
it down I'll start here on the front
corner and match up this pattern turn it
back and play with a little bit there
pull these corners up square them up and
mark them line up my mark on this back
corner and work with it I'm going to
start about an inch in from the edge
here
I'm going to stop a little bit short of
the corner on this third side allow for
a larger opening this cushion is ready
to stop to finish my project I had to
drag out and dust off my Lochner
stuffing machine things very heavy takes
up a lot of space it's got a foot pedal
at bruises and bloody shins but it when
you need one you need one so let's get
this job wrapped up I'm 40 years into
this trade not a to this day
cushions are one of the most frustrating
things to get right I've found that I
like to have five layers of cotton on
the surface of my cushions start with a
couple of them oversized here I'll set
in three more layers of cotton these
three are cut to the same size as the
cushion dimension they'll be just a
little bit larger than the marshal unit
sup marshal unit in place and work with
the cotton
set in three more layers on top here and
work them out a little over the edge
last two layers over the top let's
Center them let them hang over a little
bit I'll turn these ends back and when I
made these three panels here I had some
leftover strips of cotton they're about
the same height of the spring in it and
work with those and put them in here
after this all gets pulled together
that'll be about four layers on the ends
and five layers on the top
slip the cover-up over the end of the
machine lining this cord up along the
side I'm going to relax it out tighten
this up and line up my cord
I use the steam equalizer and pull this
all out tight I need to tuck just a
little bit more cotton into this ear
that goes down into the crevice along
the arm finish rounding this out
I'll work this regulator in kind of
careful with it and pull this cotton
back and even up the stuffing in these
corners
I'm going to call it a wrap on this job
