take the tape make sure it's
square if it's not just give it a rip go
right to the ceiling with
it this is the only joint of the ceiling
that I recommend overlapping your
tape I always recommend doing your
inside Corners
first I don't like to see paper over top
of
paper on the wall so before I do this
wall joint I want to do my inside corner
I want to bring my paper up to this
point cuz I don't want to make this
joint any thicker than it needs to be so
right now I'm just gently pressing that
into the
mud okay cleaning it a little bit of
excess now most people sto
there and here's the
secret when you're done get it
wet and then take it off
again and I'll tell you why it's so
important to
do if the surface of this paper is dry
like it is right
now while it's setting up and
curing it's going to lift right off that
wall if your paper isn't wet it will
form an air
bubble
again I don't understand that the
science all I know is from experience if
I don't have wet paper drawing on my
wall it's going to form air bubbles and
it's going to come
off so I'm going to just keep on wiping
it on and wiping it
off make sure it's nice and
clean this way when I come back
tomorrow I
know I'm not going to have any
Bubbles and I don't have to go backwards
before I go forwards again
okay so we're going to tape our
horizontal joint next after we've done
our inside Corners again the system here
is really simple you don't want to have
tape over tape so before we can do our
butt joints we want to have the
horizontal joint on again we've had this
filled and it's dried overnight so
process remember we talked about the
taper joint so from about 2 in up and 2
inch down it's all recessed all right
just take your knife
put on your mud this is a heck of a lot
faster than any technique you've ever
seen in any of RS
before okay
wow come
back and you're not removing it from the
area that we're putting the tape you're
just removing it from the excess over
and above what we need remember that's
higher and that's higher than this is so
we're going to fill the gap
finish off the rest of the
wall no sense taping halfway to the end
of this wall and then
stopping there we go now when you're
doing this remember we talked about the
the crease you want to have the crease
inside the wall so nice straight
edge place that right where we're
starting and you want to know where it
is just put your knife there it'll sit
in the crack take can mark
it there we
go so now what we have to do is we want
to get rid of the excess mud that's
underneath this tape just to set it in
the mud so I'm going to use my Hawk to
hold it my second pair of hands just the
last last couple feet here okay folks
all right this is what I'm talking about
now I have one depth of finish okay now
you can come
back now watch this same thing off the
side of the
knife get that paper
wet clean it
up now it's okay if you fill the gap
between the paper in the edge of that
recess in the in the drywall oops I'm
losing my step here so we're going to
press it out clean the top clean the
bottom take a little bit of mud off the
side and then we missed a
spot very important make sure everything
gets wet if you have a wrinkle just grab
the edge of the
tape and stretch it
out again let's clean the
mud make sure it's wet
clean that
off so the butt joint is one of the
major reasons why we want to water our
mud down the science is really simple
because we have two surfaces that are
the same thickness we're going to add
mud and then add tape we're creating a
bump so what we want to do is the
science is to stretch that bump of
whatever 2 mm over a large area so that
we are causing ourselves to focus on
such a large piece of well we can't
identify the fact that it comes out and
goes back in again because we don't see
any
Shadows this is not about leveling this
well is never going to be level it'll
never be flat it'll always have a bump
you want to just make the bump so
gradual and so wide that it's not
recognizable one of the ways you do that
is by staggering your joints don't ever
put them on top of each other because
now you're creating an opportunity if
the Sun hits it just a certain way
you're going to see that bump okay
so it's the same thing you want to fill
the Gap side of the
knife put it on nice and
liberal now when you're doing the
horizontal joint you want to work from
the bottom up if you do it from the top
down and I'll show you this
demonstration here we go oh
goopy mud's going to end up everywhere
okay if you work from the bottom down
bottom up you have a lot more control
the mud's getting pushed to the side
while you're going up and it will stick
to the wall take our paper tape check
your
Edge make sure it's nice and
square find that spot where we want to
start
[Music]
okay press the mud out from behind set
your
depth just gently press it in not too
firmly at this point
okay
now we have to hold the
hawk and press
[Music]
up okay that'll keep your fingers clean
and it'll also set it up so that you can
clean the mud out from the bottom a lot
of times you'll see guys when they're
taping they have a huge Mount of mud at
the bottom cuz they don't take the time
to be clean with the work take the time
and do clean
work makes installing your baseboards
easier okay so the other element of the
wall all you want to cover is the
ceiling corners and then the screws so
the ceiling Corners are simple same
thing load your mud on come off the side
of the tape side of your
knife okay now there's that hardener we
talked about earlier it's all set in
place
now we only did that 30 minutes ago but
we're ready to tape the corner
[Music]
just making sure I have mud everywhere
cuz I don't want to have a dry
spot good same thing inside corner
measure tear rip
install just place it up in there nice
and
gentle get your third
hand press that in
okay really
nice get it
right get the wrinkles out of
it when you're done put your knife up
against your corner create pressure tear
it
off that's done so how to fill the screw
hole properly I know it sounds silly
it's the smallest issue but most of the
time when you're checking the wall from
imperfections it's going to be a screw
hole problem all right so people come
along and they'll wipe the mud in two
different directions and that's great so
you fill the hole problem is the mud
shrinks when it dries and most of these
screws have been put in with a dimpler
and that thickness needs a second coat
so don't just do it once and think
you're done make sure every time you do
your coat on your wo you hit your screws
now if you go this way and then this
way you'll get the job done but you'll
see what
happens it's a lot of work you're going
to have little pieces left everywhere if
you have too much mud on your tool
you're like oh no oh oh oh it's a lot of
time to spend on a
screw instead put it on the same way
you're applying it off the side go up
and
down off the side and then straight down
this way you're applying it on 2 in
going up and cleaning it with a 4in tool
coming down no extra mess you can do all
the screw holes in this entire basement
in about 10 minutes all right so the
last element that you want to make sure
that you take care of on your first coat
of mud is your Paper Bead outside
corners that have the metal on the
inside of them okay there's two kind of
corner beads there's this and there's
metal actually there's three there are
plastic those are for fancy things if
you're doing curves you're going to have
to get that but we're going to cover
this one for first coat
because I like to fill it get it in and
then leave all this paper exposed just
like my rest of my paper joints I find
if I put this on during the second coat
and then I try to fill it right away I
end up putting too much moisture there
it always bubbles so always put this on
in your first coat it won't cause you
any problems this is really designed for
bulkheads the way we do our bulkheads is
we you know have to watch the video we
set up a laser and now we have metal
tracking here so we don't have any wood
in this corner to screw anything to so I
want to just take my rasp
make sure my outside corner is nice and
clean and I don't have any
protrusions did you see
that keep your Hawk underneath catch all
your drip you never get mud on your
shoes now you see all this Mass mess
down
here we should have taken the time to
put a filler in
[Music]
here but if you didn't
[Music]
because this Paper Bead comes with
Corner that's full of metal you can get
away with using regular mud
here the idea is just get it all on and
we just want a nice big wet line here
that's wider than our corner
[Music]
bead all right now in the corner bead
here's the metal Corner this is the
short side it's 3/8 this one is almost
5/8
the wide metal goes over the exposed
drywall okay folks that's very important
so when you're measuring always make
sure you got it you're holding it right
so that your finished Factory Edge is
going up another finish Factory Edge and
you just place it
in use your knife now you want to have a
gap so make sure you move it around and
have a gap there's my ceiling check this
out no Gap so I can just pull down that
corner
make sure that I have a gap so I'm going
to clean that
out
there pull it down a little bit Gap
Gap that's what we're doing making sure
that everywhere we
go we have a gap to
fill so that we don't have to bring the
mud up and around to
finish all
right now again like I said if you do it
this way and you let that sit overnight
it'll be nice and dry and then when you
come back to do your Corners you can
fill it with 45 your quick set mud with
the hardener and then about an hour
later you can come by and put your
finish coat on and all your outside
corners are
done okay so that's basically all they
need to know about how to do a first
coat so we're just going to finish all
of our joints and we'll see you again
