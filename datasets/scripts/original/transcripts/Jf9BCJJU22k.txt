hey guys it's Jen I'm going to show you
a quick and easy side and it's glazed
carrots all right so we have about a
pound of baby carrots and they are cut
in half
lengthwise I have A3 cup of packed brown
sugar we have a/ teaspoon of
salt 2 tbspoon of butter and then and
this is a half a teaspoon of grated
orange peel and I totally cheated and
got it from the spice section uh but it
it'll still be really good so the first
thing we're going to do is we're going
to put the baby carrots into about an
inch of
water and we are going to cover these
up and it's salted salted water and
we're going to let them heat up and get
soft it's probably going to take about 5
or 10 minutes after it comes to a little
boil boil so let it come to a boil let
them simmer for 5 or 10 minutes so they
get nice and soft all right so the
carrots have been boiling for about 10
minutes now I'm going to drain them and
get started on the glaze all right so
let's get started on the glaze I'm going
to add the
butter let that start
[Music]
melting I'm going to add the brown
sugar salt and orange peel
and we're just going to mix this up
until it gets nice and bubbly and then
we'll add the carrots back
in all right so this is mixing together
nicely I'm going to add the carrots back
in here I'm going to let everything just
cook together for a few more
minutes to get the carrots nice and
glazed in
here just make sure they're nice and
coated
all right so these have been cooking on
low heat now for about 5 minutes you can
see the glaze is nice and thin now the
carrots are nicely coated uh just cook
them until they're just soft enough for
you and they will be ready well I hope
