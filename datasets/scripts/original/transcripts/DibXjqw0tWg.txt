just drying my hands
thank you
oh wow that's warm
i feel like royalty
so this is a type of cornbread that you
don't have to wait for a whole
45 minutes for it to bake you can eat it
at pretty much any meal of the day and
it has a secret ingredient that makes it
extra corny want to find out what it is
it's popcorn
just a little bit a tablespoon of it
the thing that todd richards says that
he loves about putting popcorn in his
cornbreads is the flavor because
popcorn gives a different kind of corn
flavor than regular cornmeal does it's
nuttier and also has a little bit of
bitterness it also does tons of things
for the texture
it doesn't have the same texture as when
you just eat popcorn out of hand because
it loses some of its airiness but it
keeps a softness and a little bit of
extra crunch
if you were making microwave popcorn you
would never get to see this
this is so cool
they're like chicks being born
i'm gonna give a little shake
can you hear that
so todd richards calls this hot water
cornbread and that's an important part
of the technique because basically you
put your fine cornmeal
and all of your other dry ingredients
into a bowl and then you dump hot water
over them and let it sit for five
minutes and that just makes everything
hydrate
psa grading your own nutmeg
changes everything buy the whole ones
grated on a microplane it smells like
eggnog it smells like cheesy delicious
fondues it smells like everything good
basically nutmeg is my favorite thing
and i really don't want you to get
ground nutmeg i want you to grate it
like this it's so easy
so all my dry stuff
is in there and now this is the hot
water part
this is part of what allows you to make
cornbread so fast is that
you know if you just kind of stirred
cornmeal together with some stuff and
fried it it might still be crunchy
inside if you if you weren't careful
about it but this hot water kind of
pushes things ahead so this just needs
five minutes to hang out and then we
will add our other stuff the last couple
things to add in are our popcorn that we
just made so one tablespoon of
corn kernels pops up to a pretty
respectable amount
and some buttermilk
it's pretty cool looking and not really
what you'd expect when you're mixing up
cornbread
so this is just one out of four
different cornbreads that todd richards
has in his book soul it's so gorgeous
and there's a whole chapter on corn
these are the ones we're making
okay five minutes later it's time to
shape
so we gotta get good flowery hands
so that the cornmeal doesn't stick to
them too much
and then
you just make it into these little
patties
and you get to make a really good mess
in the process
okay all that's left to do is fry our
little cornbreads this is the part that
reminds me a lot of things that my
grandmother would make when i was
growing up like cornmeal pancakes she
would make something called fried
cornmeal mush which i think is basically
like leftover polenta that's fried
so you want to make sure it's sizzling
when it hits the pan
so because we dumped that boiling water
over the dry ingredients that means that
all you really have to do here is crisp
it up on both sides that's one of the
genius things about this hot water
cornbread technique hockey do you want
to come take a look at
so see you can see the little crispiness
on the sides
ooh
just burn my arm a little
no i got it it's cool
yeah it's okay i can just use this okay
so
just so you don't splash yourself second
tool is helpful
scoop these out
you could have them with eggs for
breakfast
you could have them as croutons and a
salad with something needy where you can
get all the sauces in there
all right
this reminds me so much of my
grandmother's fried cornmeal mash but
also
i just ran into a piece of popcorn and
that made it a totally different
experience
