hi welcome back once again to how toook
great food.com so let's get started on
this turnip Curry which is really
delicious as you can see I've got one
there a turn one there I've peeled them
cut them up quite small the next step is
I'm going to put these into some salt
water and I'm going to boil them and I
want to kind of get them like mashed
potato if you've got a pressure cooker
it be much faster um yeah you know just
get them to that kind of soft kind of
level where they're kind of just moving
your hand then we're going to mash them
I'm going to add a little bit of salt to
the water I'll see you at that
stage okay so there you are I've cooked
my turnips for about about 15 minutes
that was they're nice and soft so I'm
going to drain
them discard the water and then I'm
going to get my Masher in there and
roughly mash them up see you in a moment
okay so here I am now at the next stage
I've got a pan here A Touch of vegetable
oil in there you can use any oil you
like and I'm just going to introduce
some cumin
seeds just let them pop and crackle for
a few seconds they'll release their
fantastic arous
now I've got some garlic ginger paste
here which is
50% garlic and ginger really finely
mixed I'm going in with some powders
I've got turmeric or howy chili powder
and coriander powder about equal
amounts this is on a fairly high heat
and we don't want to burn our powders
otherwise they'll taste bitter so we
really quite at this stage now some
onions I'm using a red
[Music]
onion you can use a white if you
want just going to add a little touch of
salt while we're here
I'm going to put a lid on
this cook this for about 3 to four
minutes I'm about to turn the heat down
I don't want them to get too Burns see
you then right let's jump

chili entirely up to you how much you go

two or three more minutes I want those
tomatoes to cook down and create a
little bit of a sauce for us see you
