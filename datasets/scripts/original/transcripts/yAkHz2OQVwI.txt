hi I'm Marie Lockwood thanks for joining
us today at cakes cooking and more we
are doing banana split cake today so I
hope that you enjoy it let's see what we
need to get
started okay so for today's recipe you
actually need quite a few things uh
you're going to need two separ amounts
of butter these are vanilla wafers that
have been crumbled up some banana slices
some crushed pineapple some powdered
sugar whipped cream topping these are
just some little bit of chopped pecans
some cherries some eggs and some vanilla
and I'll put all of the amounts in the
description box okay so the first thing
that we need to
do is we are going to take our um
chopped up or well crunched up vanilla
wafers and we're going to cover those
with our butter now we're going to have
to melt this first in the microwave and
you want it completely melted and
okay now that our butter is completely
melted you're just going to pour that
directly on top of the
cookies
just going to lightly stir trying to get
that butter throughout all of
them all right now we're going to take
our pan this is a 9
by3 we're just going to pour all of that
right into the
bottom
okay I'm just going to try to flatten
that out as much as you can you want a
nice little crust at the
bottom
okay now that we've got that fairly
even we're going to set this to the side
and then we're going to start on our
next part okay so for this part we need
our butter pretty soft not completely
melted so I did about 20 seconds in the
microwave and you're going to want to
get that nice and fluffy before you do
anything
[Applause]
else
okay as you can see it's got a nice
fluff to it now we're going to add our
vanilla we going to add our powdered
sugar and I need my
spatula there we go all right so we're
going to finish adding our powdered
sugar
okay we're also going to add two
eggs okay and now we are going to blend
this until it's well well Blended and
mix
up okay now that we
are completely mixed up you can see that
it's nice
fluffy so then we'll get all our stuff
to do the now we have all of our
ingredients ready to go together so
we're going to take our cookies that
have been
softening we're going to take our nice
mixture
here we're going to put that right on
top
okay now we're going to spread this out
and try to get fairly even layer across
all of
it and it won't be super
thick but you should have enough to get
over all of
it
and once you have a nice good
layer we'll go to our next
ingredient all right so this time we are
going to add our crushed
pineapple and again we're just going to
do the same thing sort of layer it on
top not too heavy try to get it get
spread
out and again just make sure that you
have well drained the pineapple you
don't want all that juice down in
there you don't have to use the whole
can if you don't want to you can shorten
that a little
bit
okay let we have that layer done now
we're going to take our banana you can
actually slice them lengthwise and do
long pieces but I did little
chunks so it really doesn't matter
that's totally up to you but you again
just want to spread these
out so that each person that has some
gets a
bite it is banana split cakes so you
want to make sure that they all get a
banana again you don't have to cover it
completely as much or as little as you
want
okay now that we have our bananas on we
are now going to take our Whi topping
and put our next layer
[Music]
on and I actually set mine out for a
little while just so that it would
soften and make the spreading a little
bit
easier didn't take long I think it's
been out about 20 30
minutes
I don't suggest that you put it in the
microwave though because then you're
just going to
have a very very thin mixture that
you're not going to be completely happy
with all right once you got that out you
just want to spread that
in again try to get some in every spot
so that everybody who has some gets
some
okay now that we have that spread out
try to get it kind of even on top it's
almost impossible
but okay now you're going to take your
little cherries and decorate the top
just like you would with a banana
split I don't quite have enough
cherries we'll just move those around a
little bit there we go all right then we
take our chopped
pecan you just want to sprinkle those on
top
okay and there you have it okay so here
is our banana split cake completely
finished make sure that you store this
in the refrigerator because it will go
completely bad if you leave it on the
counter everything in it needs to be
refrigerated so I'm Marie looy thanks
