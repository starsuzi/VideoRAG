[Applause]
yeah woo All You guitar jams people out
there hello
we're going to do some tremolo whammy
bar whatever you want to call it get
your ibz your Kramer your Shor your
whatever the heck you got tune it down a
half step in the spirit of Hell Fire and
metal and we're going to work on some
tricks and tips and harmonics and bar
Fanatics click the links below guitar
jams is good good de you you know they
got lots of cool stuff Marty's the
man show your
support let's get to
it all right so again tuned down a half
step now what I did right there was it's
called harmonics I know a lot of you are
already familiar with what harmonics are
but you have natural harmonics on the
guitar the easiest ones to hit are on
the 12th fret the seventh fret and the
fifth fret now what they are is you put
any finger you want but you're going to
go directly over the Fret bar itself and
you don't press down on the string you
just touch the string and you get a
sound
like
now they're all over the place but those
are the easiest ones to hit so in metal
what a lot of guys will do is they'll
utilize those harmonics with a little
bar dive so what we can do is one when I
was a kid I remember one of the first
times I heard it was on a Van Halen
record it was a live without a net and
he did a deal where he would hit the
open G string and to press the G string
down so you
got and he would catch this F fret g
string harmonic on the way back up so
you
got or you can
just right let me roll
whatever right so all you're doing there
is you're hitting the open G
[Applause]
string and you're depressing the bar
about two whole steps on the
guitar and you're just bringing it back
up so all you're doing with the
bar is that but you're on the way back
up catching that harmonic so you
got right and then you just depressing
the bar over and over again now what you
can do also that I didn't show by
example very well is when you do that
kind of stuff you also want to mute to
kind of block out the other string
noise cuz when you depress the strings
they'll get loose and they'll
slack
right so what we can do is p mute like
we've been doing in all of our other
lessons and just let that one string
ring
open now you can also catch these other
Frets now excuse me ahead of time if I
don't get them because a little of these
are tricky but there's also one right
after this second fret basically right
around where this dot is and it really
helps to add um a little more gain to
get these it really helps them pop out a
lot so what we can do is go right about
where that dot
is and you get another
one right so again it's right about
there and you just
touch
now what you can do right there is
another way to depress the bar is as
you're depressing the bar down and I'm
just going to show you on an open
string so as you're pushing down you're
fluctuating this
hand going
[Music]
down
right so there's all kinds of little
harmonic tricks you could do now you can
also use hammer on and pull-offs and
kind of uh soloing riff
ideas you got all your VI and your Van
Halen and all these guys that are really
good at doing this kind of exercise so
what you're going to do is you're going
to bend
up right so all you're doing there is
you're bending up like about a whole
step it's not going to matter too much
because you're going to be depressing
the bar at the same time so it's more of
an effect but what you're doing is
you're bending up so we're going to take
that g
string seventh fret fifth fret and
you're going to bend
up come back down and pull
off now while we're doing that riff what
we're going to do is we're going to
depress the bar so we got
[Applause]
so as we Bend up go down pull off and as
soon as we Hammer that note to bend it
up again we're going to depress the bar
so we
got so you're depressing the bar as
you're climbing up to the whole step
pitch of the seventh fret so we
got so
again
there's another way you can do it now
there's also you can do it right out of
this pentatonic you can go down to that
uh e or B string version where you have
that little bit more of a spread so you
got the fifth and eighth Fifth and
eighth you can do it on
a so what I'm doing there is I'm doing
the same kind of hammer on and pull
[Music]
off you know it's
it's just that simple but what you're
doing to make it sound a little bit
cooler is how you're using the
bar so you can do it like we did
before but now when you hammer on you're
going to pull off hammer on and then
depress the bar so you
got now you can do it with two bar dips
now as you notice there I'm just I'm
actually hammering on these strings I'm
not even
picking so we
got right so you can do all
that
all I'm doing there is I'm just going
right down the pentatonic scale but as I
hammer each
note you're just doing a bar dip right
now one word of warning I forgot to
mention this in the beginning but I have
a locking nut which is a Floyd Rose
system it looks like that right there
and uh what's great about this is you
can do all this bar Stu and not go out
of tune some guitars have the uh locking
tuners back here um as long as you have
a good nut where these strings go across
what happens is when you depress that
bar slack is created in the strings and
as it goes back through the nut when it
tightens back up the strings will catch
so if you have a nut that's really well
oiled that sounds all beas what's up
beas uh but if you have a really well
oiled nut that really helps if you don't
have a uh locking device right here um
so anyways that's uh one thing you got
to watch out for but if we have the kind
of guitar like this or an ivanz or
whatever you can you
know and you come right back in tune
which is amazing so anyways that's some
other stuff we can do what else can we
do with bar
div
we got the
trill got Herm
Maris now just never underestimate you
know playing some Rhythm when you can
just throw it in you be
like
so it doesn't have to be always with
lead playing you can do it you know
throw it all in all sorts of types of
rhythm
now you can do it also like you can hit
the octave
runs you know and do the same depression
as you're sliding down so instead of
just
going right as you're sliding will
depress the bar so you
got I'm just doing octave R so I'm the a
string and the g string uh in this
particular instance It's s and n 57 35 2
4 so we
got all right so we
got
so what you're doing there is you're
just using the bar as like an accent
like a rhythm accent so we
[Music]
got right so instead of
going
and you can also just go all the way
down to press that thing all the way
down to where the strings just
[Music]
hang and pull into a chord you know
whatever chord you want you do it with
a
so again that's just depressing the bar
all the way down let me turn up my
volume here pressing the bar all the way
down and then coming putting your hand
into a
[Music]
chord
so we can do that we can go uh down the
scale so what you're doing there is
you're just taking the notes out of your
scale so that's 12th fret 11th fret at
9th 7th fifth 4th 2nd open so we
got so we
go oh let's try that
[Applause]
again right so there's another option
you can do so the bar slide
down um what else can we do with the bar
here you know I'm sure there's something
but I can't think of anything else so
try try those to begin with so let's
review really quick we got the bend up
hammeron
depress you got just a normal
Trill that you just TR
back
do that on this part of the
pentatonic you
go can do that you can do the
harmonics you can bend into the
chords
and then you can just go straight down
the
scale you can use it in
rhythm
[Music]
right just get creative with it you know
it's just another tool and I don't
overuse it but uh you know it's one of
those things that's fun to use just as a
little spice you know like a little
pepper Cayenne in your eye
but uh whatever so use it sparingly but
have fun with it at the same time uh
good bands to check out obviously Van
Halen uh Steve VI Joe Satriani can do
just amazing things with the bar so
check out all those kind of people and
really uh listen to how they use it you
know they sometimes it seems like they
use it a lot but they use it very
creatively so it doesn't sound redundant
and just thrown in there just because so
uh get creative out there in guitar jams
land and uh we'll catch you next time
and keep shredding don't let shred die
let it
multiply
yeah
