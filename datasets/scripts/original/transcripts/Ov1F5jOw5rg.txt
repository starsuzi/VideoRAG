we had some cheese dip left from our uh
draft party the other night uh this
recipe is online I'll place the link
below what we're going to do with this
leftover cheese dip is that we're going
to use it to make some spaghetti with
cheese dip and chicken very simple we're
just going to cook the spaghetti
according to a manufacturer's
recommendations or Package
directions and we'll be adding the
cheese dip and some uh canned chicken
breast to make a delicious leftover
meal our pasta is draining and in the
same pot I have put a 12 and 1/2 o uh
can of chicken with the broth
we're going to add about half of this
cheese dip to that and get it melting
down and then we will put our pasta back
and that will be pretty much it that
simple well I ended up putting all that
uh Vita cheese dip uh into the chicken
as you can see it melts really quickly
we're going to add the pasta back to
it and that's all there is to it we've
added the pasta back stirred it together
looks absolutely delicious can hardly
wait to eat it it's so simple just take
the cheese dip from the recipe we made
the other day add some chicken canned
chicken and some spaghetti and you have
a great little meal hope you make it and
I hope you like it
