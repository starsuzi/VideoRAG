today I'm going to cut a beautiful
Shaver Lake amethyst this is one that uh
client brought in and uh it's a pretty
good example of uh what the Shaver Lake
material looks
like just about all the material from
shaver has kind of an edged surface uh
all the all the crystal faces are edged
they're not shiny uh they're kind of
dull but uh inside this Crystal is some
beautiful uh deep lavender purple
amethyst that uh is just dying to come
out of here so uh I'm going to trim it
up and uh get it ready for
fasting okay the first thing that I'm
going to do is to inspect it and look
for all the the clear quarty areas
around the around the bottom of this
Crystal the base of this Crystal has a
lot of a clear area but the core is a
deep uh clear purple there's some flaws
inside as well but uh it's hard to see
them until I trim off some of the excess
material here that uh won't be good for
faceted gems so I'll go ahead and Mark
it and start
selling okay you can see where I marked
it I'm going to take off a couple big
chunks of it um I'm just going to make a
couple cuts at a time here just to kind
of Whittle it
down okay you can see it's getting
smaller and whittling it down and uh
getting down to the real good material
here so
should have something uh start grinding
here pretty
quick okay you can see that uh starting
to trim off some of the good material
it's getting down to the the core pretty
clear but I've noticed one big flaw that
goes kind of uh near center right across
here you can see it going to the
piece let's see what happens after the
cut on that line
you can see kind of butterfly these two
pieces hey the main piece is getting a
little smaller now but uh it's really
nice in the center it's got a core
beautiful material so I'm just going to
keep
trimming and uh gets to a point where
then I start grinding and I really get
it to
shape okay got it to a point where uh I
think I'll start to grind it and uh
preform it into a shape uh before I can
uh dop it up onto my machine and start
fasting beautiful
piece hey this is kind of the leftover
trimmings uh not much here there's some
mods and in small pieces uh um may not
be worthwhile for me to cut at this
point so uh we'll just bag that up over
here we've got the ones that uh turned
out nice this is the main
one there's some uh others here they
look pretty good too but this is going
to be a beauty that's uh the kingstone
for
sure this one uh it's uh looking pretty
good it's it's quite a bit lighter than
this one though it's a different
leak and there's some there some odds
and ends that I'm just going to preform
automatic
so once I get them preformed I'll be
able to tell about how big a Stones Z
finish decided on the shape here it
looks like it's going to be kind of an
oval cushion type uh shape uh this will
be the
table uh just c a little flaw off the
back side here that I uh don't think
it's going to show just a slight Veil
that you have to hit the light just
right on it uh I don't think it's going
to be a problem uh material is going to
be so dark that uh I doubt that you'll
be able to see anything uh maybe with a
loop you can or maybe through the back
under bright lighting after it's
finished but uh right now uh I'm going
to go for an oh I'm going to kind of I'm
going to see that band right in the
middle right there I I want to avoid
that uh being real noticeable so I'm
going to orientate it a little bit over
to the side right here maybe get a
little bit more of an oval shape uh in
doing that too so go ahead and uh get it
ready now it's
uh it's at the point now where got a
real good idea what it's all about
so ready to start to fastet uh put on
the do and start to grind and shape into
a finished Stone but uh basically it's
going to be a big oval so let's go ahead
and weigh
it okay 14 1 12 G which would be uh
about 72 and 1 12 carats so
um that should finish at least of around
60% uh recovery on this preform so I
would think that uh finish Stone will be
uh it's a little over 40 Kat so maybe a
little
more see how it goes and I'll put some
refractor oil on it this really gims it
up makes it look shiny like a it's got a
Polish on it you can really get a good
idea how this is going to look when it's
finished isn't that
beautiful beautiful
gy think about about the shaver leg
material when it's dark like this it has
a a good Siberian red flash to
it that uh not much amethyst has this
kind of character it's very blue red
pink flashes that come out of it uh very
nice
material most of it's on the lighter
side but uh occasionally there are
some top stones that come out of Shaver
Lake
that's going to be gorgeous
though somewhere around a 42 karat
range maybe
45 that be
nice okay I'm going to start uh
fastening the stone I'm going to put it
on the dop here and uh get it
going waving it over the flame here
so that doesn't be too hot too quick but
I might
crack okay got it down there I think
it's pretty
straight looking
good take it down and I'm going to start
cutting PL spot on there first one
[Music]
to the other side

get
there and fast in there
