all right last night David shot his deer
and today we're gonna cook up some heart
and some liver
[Music]
you got uncle Morgan's here uncle Travis
is here Uncle Mike is here so we're
gonna cook it up I'm not a big fan of
liver and Morgan claims that liver makes
Anbar so but we're both going to give it
a try this Travis says last time he
cooked liver it was pretty good let's
see what happens here
tell me to go ahead and just go ahead
and start with the heart yeah all right
this is flour put a bunch of seasonings
in it like some red pepper some barbecue
seasoning some garlic and little bit of
salt the heart has been soaking in milk
and a salt overnight in theory that
should help but not the flavor more mild
he's just gonna dump out the milk and
salt mixture
things gonna give it a quick rinse
[Music]
Travis got a little bit of onion action
right there that's gonna be from the
liver we're gonna go just bread it and
fry it at the heart we've got some
coconut oil already heat it up
[Music]
I'm gonna cook the onions until they're
brown or just slightly translucent
translucent
[Music]
now that's tenderloin right there that's
the good stuff we're gonna cook this
tenderloin up so that if the heart and
the liver are disgusting we can wash it
down with some actual meat all right
hearts done try a piece Morgan and I
want an honest reaction most reaction
okay if it's good or bad
I would pick that I'm gonna let me start
with the sampler sighs Claire it's yours

absolutely not question if you weren't
starving to death

dear heart
[Music]
I forget all that it's a little more
full in telecom estate it's not it's not
a state it's not today you know what
forces assurance odds would work good
with this I think
[Music]

bloody sponge yeah
all right got the onions in there uncle
Morgan's doing the cooking good how do
they tell us
[Music]

[Music]
I'm going in very brave operate it's

terrible that is a lot better than the
last time

think you could eat it if you are
starving or you would eat it willingly
