hi guys today we're doing this rustic
looking table I made this from pretty
simple materials stirring sticks
popsicle sticks and wooden dowels
Godfrey stirring sticks to size to be
the top cut the popsicle stick into
smaller pieces for support and for the
legs cut a dowel into four equal pieces
sand down any edges where they would
have spread while cutting rough off the
texture of the wood I started with a
nail file then I moved on to a knife and
cut slits to make it look very old and
chipped be careful when doing this if
you're not an adult and have adult
supervision
I have someone help you
Roth off the leg pieces as well
through the stirring sticks together to
form the tabletop
once dry glue on the legs be sure
they're straight
blue in the sports
once completely dry thin down to McRib
paint and stain the wood
I have a few different sheets scrape
your knife against the surface while
it's still drying for additional veins
you
finally use a dark brown acrylic thing
to define everything
finish with the color glaze to protect
the paint and the project is complete
