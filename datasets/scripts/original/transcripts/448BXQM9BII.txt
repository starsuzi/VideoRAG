hey y'all what's cooking it's Chelsea
Silverman here at
juiceria and right now we're going to go
into a fresh lemonade so I'm going to
choose to do this in a blender you can
use a juicer to squeeze the lemons and
then add the other ingredients but
here's how I'm going to do it so we're
going to take our lemon about a lemon
and a
half I cut off the Rind of the lemon but
I kept most of the inside the White
there are a lot of nutrients in this
area that we really want to have in our
body so we'll just throw that in then
we'll take some filtered water or clean
water whatever water that you have
available to
you that's about three cups a little bit
over and then we'll take our honey this
will sweeten up the lemonade in nice
natural
way you know about 2
tablespoons 2 and 1 12 tablespoons will
be perfect and we'll just blend it
up perfect so here we have it nice
beautiful M honey sweetened
lemonade oh my gosh this smells so good
and I know it's going to be good so what
you can also do with
this amazing this is like a power
lemonade which we sell here at the store
but what we do at the store is we add
Cayenne speed up metabolism or Ginger
really good for digestion also your skin
so you can easily add any of those into
your mixture you can also add Mac powder
any superfood that you enjoy and Cheers
To Your Health power
