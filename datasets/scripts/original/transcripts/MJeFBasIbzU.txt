Hi and welcome to episode #178 
with Whats4Chow.com
Kfc fried chicken is legendary, 
and there must be hundreds
of websites and videos claiming 
to have cracked the
secret recipe of 11 herbs and 
spices.
Others get into deep discussions
about how the chicken
is pressure fried.
Over time I have tried many of 
these copycat recipes
and can only say that it was one
disappointment after the next.
None of them even came close to 
the real thing. 
Today I will reveal to you the 
actual secret behind the
legendary taste, aroma and 
texture of this iconic chicken.
Before I continue, I would just 
like make a point. 
Whats4Chow.com is the FIRST TO 
PUBLISH THIS, and I am
sure that there will be a load 
of other channels copying
my video within a very short 
time of this being published.
Unfortunately there is nothing I
can do to prevent this,
but to those free loaders out 
there that will inevitably
copy my work, please have the 
decency to give our channel
and website the credit it 
deserves for finally decoding 
the
mystery of the world's finest 
chicken brand. 
Let's get started by saying that
it is not the secret blend
of 11 herbs and spices, and it 
is not the use of pressurized
deep fryers, or the type of oil 
or shortening used to do this.
The secret to the insanely good 
flavor, texture and aroma
is in the preparation of the 
chicken before it even coated.
This is how to do it!
Combine the paprika, onion salt,
sage, garlic powder,
oregano, chilli powder, black 
pepper, basil, marjoram and
coriander in a bowl and mix it 
together, then divide this in 
half.
Pour 2.5lt of filtered water 
into a pot and add half of
the spice mix along with the 
whole allspice, and whole black 
peppercorns.
Also add the salt, saltpeter, 
sugar and bicarbonate of soda.
Bring the pot to a boil, 
stirring frequently. Reduce the
heat and allow the pot to simmer
for 5 minutes.
Remove the pot from the heat and
allow the brine to cool 
completely.
Using a carving fork or similar 
tool, poke holes through
the skin of the chicken pieces, 
then place them in a large
sterilized container.
Pour the cooled brine over the 
chicken pieces, put the lid
on and let this cure in your 
refrigerator for a full 24 
hours. 
Before I continue, for this 
recipe to succeed, you cannot
omit anything, especially the 
saltpetre and bicarb.
The proper curing process is 
where the taste, texture and
juiciness comes from.
After 24 hours, remove the 
chicken from the brine.
Combine 2 cups of all purpose 
flour with the other half of
the spices, and lightly beat 4 
eggs.
Dredge the chicken in the flour 
mixture, then dip it in
the egg making sure to wet all 
of the flour.
Dredge the chicken in the flour 
again making sure to get
a good solid coating.
Sprinkle a layer of the flour 
mixture onto a platter,
transfer the coated chicken 
pieces to the platter and
allow the coating to set for 20 
minutes.
Half fill your wok or pot with 
oil. Heat the oil to 160c or 
325f.
Fry the chicken pieces for 20 
minutes, turning over halfway.
Remove the chicken from the oil,
drain on kitchen paper and 
serve.
Just a few more notes before we 
go....
The chicken must fry for at 
least 20 minutes. If you fry
hotter and shorter, the coating 
will have a chalky texture.
The chicken is cured, and as a 
result it can stand in a low
oven for extended periods of 
time with no health risks,
just as it does in the store. 
This makes it possible to
make a mountain of chicken 
before your guests arrive.
Smaller cuts like the KFC wings 
and chicken burgers will
be covered in the next few days.
