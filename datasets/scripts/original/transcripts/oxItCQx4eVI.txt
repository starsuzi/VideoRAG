Hi everyone.
Getting healthy can be fun and easy and the
premise of any new healthy lifestyle is having
greens in your diet.
Green smoothies are a great way to do it.
This is very pertinent information for any
kind of naked lifestyle; the Naked Challenge
is based on green smoothies.
It’s about cleaning your body.
The difference between green smoothie and
a green juice is that green smoothie is very
fibrous.
It has fruits, it’s very filling, and it’s
a meal in itself.
Green juice is of course meal but you're going
to need a little bit more afterwards.
So it’s good to have a green juice before
you eat, probably half hour so that the nutrients
can absorb into the bloodstream.
A green smoothie is actually a meal in itself.
What is a green smoothie?
Fruits; we've got citrus, pear; we can use
apples or mango.
To make things easy, you can even have pre-cut
berries and pineapple and grapes as a sweet
base for your smoothie.
And then we put in greens.
We've got lettuce and cabbage and cucumber
and kale and chard and celery and the oh,
so beautifying bokchoy – a wonderful addition.
Then we have… we can always do green lettuces,
romaine lettuce has an amazing amount of protein.
Who knew?
Parsley, very cleansing for the blood.
And of course, sprouts – beautiful pea sprouts
or any kind of sprout that is delicious for
you.
Now I've had a lot of people tell me that
they are shying away from doing green smoothies
because they don’t have a high-powered four…
what is it?
Four horsepower Vitamix, Blendtec and they
don’t feel they're going to be able to make
smoothies.
We’re going to do a little test here and
we’re going to make it in a normal high-speed
blender and the Vitamix, we’ll make the
exact same or similar recipes and see how
they come out.
Okay, so let’s do these side by side.
A side by side taste test, that’s what we’re
going to do.
You want to put a liquid in first and you
can put in water, you can put in coconut water,
and you can put in fresh pressed apple juice,
you can put in orange juice.
You can literally put in anything as long
as it’s pure and it’s clean.
But for today, we’re just going to put in
some water and it’s about a cup to a cup
and a half of liquid will help process all
the things that we’re going to put in here.
Okay.
So that being said, how about we put in about
a handful of grapes for sweetness?
Grapes are great anti-oxidants, especially
when they are in season.
We’re kind of at the end of the season here
but when you can get concord grapes and they
have the seeds in them, put the seeds in.
If you have Vitamix, put the seeds in because
those are actually really good for you as
well.
On this side, I think what we’ll do is be
really creative, take just enough of the tip
off of the orange.
Leave some of the white because the white
has an amazing amount of nutrients that are
not even found inside the orange and let’s
throw that into the blender as well.
Let’s do half in this guy and half in this
guy.
I think over here, we’ll do like more a
vitamin C, berries and orange juice as our
base.
Whereas over here, we've got the grapes, we've
got the oranges.
Let’s see, is this kind of how I make green
smoothies.
What would I like to put in?
I have to be putting some pear.
Pears are really sweet and right now, they're
tremendously in season.
We can put in apples as well.
Apples break down as equally but they're super
wonderful and fibrous and good for you.
Put a little pear in here as well.
Okay, so we've got a bunch of fruit.
I like to [0:04:03] things up.
Now this is a Meyer lemon.
I love Meyer lemon.
You could just squeeze the juice in like so
or you can do exactly what we did with the
orange, which is cutting to see outer skin
off, leaving some of the fruit on and throw
it out in the blender.
That’s one thing you should really think
about when you're using a regular blender
as opposed Vitamix.
You can put the seeds in the Vitamix, but
you can't necessarily put the seeds in the…
this high-powered blender.
It might not break down as well.
Okay, I'm just to add a little more of sweet.
Not everybody likes bananas, some people love
bananas.
I don’t like to do more than a half a banana
or full banana at most.
They're very filling, they're higher in sugar.
You put the lighter things when you're eating
a smoothie but this is just enough to give
it a great sweetness.
I think what we should do is thrown in some
high sulphur bokchoy.
Okay, and put the whole thing in there.
And for this guy, because he's not able to
break things down as well, we’re going to
put in some lettuce and I think the Vitamix
can probably handle some kale, one of my favourite
finds.
Let’s put in cabbage.
Cabbage has that kind of sulphurous smell
that you think is going to be a little bit
gassy for the smoothie but it breaks down
beautifully in a smoothie and it’s super
nutrifying.
A little red leaf lettuce to keep it fun.
Let’s see, and how about nice… let’s
put a little…
just a little bit of cucumber in this guy.
There you go.
And a beautiful piece of chard.
And we’ll put him in as well.
Alright, let the magic begin.
Cameraman wants me to slow down so I must
slow down a little bit.
Okay, let’s just hope this works and I think
it’s ever as it should be.
Remember, this is the unedited version on
the Naked Zone.
Okay, so let’s go down, look at all the
colors in here.
Alright, so we put the water in so that it
can blend and let’s see what this high-speed
blender can do with these vegetables.
The thing I love about this is this isn't
even a green smoothie now.
I put some berries in and now, it’s a purple
smoothie.
I'm going to put a little bit more greens
in.
I was a little hesitant before because the
canister was so full.
I'm going to put a little bit more leaves
in and then I think we’re going to call
this smoothie done.
Hmm, okay.
I can't wait to try that one.
Take a look, a regular blender.
Let’s see, it’s smooth.
It’s got a little bit of the berry chunks
in it but I've never even seen the berries
becompletely taken down by the Vitamix.
And here, we have the Vitamix.
We have cabbage, we have kale, we have chard.
I think I'm going to stick some bokchoy in
here as well since we been from the last one,
and cucumber.
Okay, let’s see the magic of horsepower.
And this is a true green smoothie, isn't it?
And here we go, let’s pour that in.
It’s a little smoother.
It’s not as chunky.
There are no berries.
It’s not comparing apples and apples.
Now this is a meal.
This is a Naked Nourishment meal, breakfast,
lunch, dinner.
This is something that you can live on for
10 days along with some other wraps – we’ll
be showing you that – and this is all in
the Naked Challenge on the Naked Zone.
I just love this so much.
That is so delicious.
It’s like a milkshake.
You don’t even taste the greens, that’s
what the fruit really does.
It gives such a good flavour that you get
so addicted to it.
This was more got the berries in it.
It’s minorly chunky but really, same texture
more or less.
So there you have it.
Do not shy away from doing green smoothies,
whether you have a regular blender or a high
powered blender.
You can do the Naked Challenge.
I’ll see you next time.
