Oh a llama gardener and today I'm going
to share with you three secrets for
growing great tomatoes
all right it's 27 July so a question is
for all you zone 7 and higher growers
how are your Tomatoes doing
this variety of cherry tomatoes is
called a super-sweet 100 s and they are
a very good cherry tomato to grow
now I only have four plants in there 16
foot row and these tomato plants have
not been sprayed with any kind of herb a
pesticide and there are no tomato
hornworms
on these plants and I think it's all
because of the secret ingredients that I
use when I'm growing them they are
producing point quite well certainly
making more Tomatoes than we want for
our salads and there is a lot of green
tomatoes coming on these plants and the
plants themselves are still putting out
new growth
you
because I'm going to tell you in a
minute about the three secrets that I
used on growing these Tomatoes
and will show you some of it also now I
always put a little bit of triple 13
fertilizer Epsom salt and eggshell
powder in the planting hole but that is
not the secrets that I'm talking about
in this video
so the first secret is comfrey leaves in
the planting hole and I'm gonna put
three or four leaves in this hole where
I'm going to set this tomato
now the granules that you see me edit
and that's about a tablespoon of triple
13 fertilizer now let's set our tomato
plant in the hole and we're going to get
ready for secret number two
now I'm adding the eggshell powder mixed
with a little bit of vinegar water and I
have other videos on how to do that that
I can reference you too
now I'm going to add about a tablespoon
of Epsom salts can I just sprinkle it
around over the ground
so secret number two is rabbit poop soup
now I'm calling it a soup because it's
much thicker than say compost or manure
tea
now we're going to fill in the hole
around a plant and we're going to get
ourselves ready for secret number three
always water your transplants well now
secret number three is a foliar spray
and it's going to be sprayed with milk
and I need to show you how to mix it and
then we'll show you how to spray it
now I'm using powdered milk because it's
easy to store and therefore way I always
have it on hand but you can use regular
milk skim milk 2% 4% whole milk doesn't
matter if you're using store-bought
bottle milk it would be 1 cup of milk 2
4 cups of water
you
now spray the tomato leaves to the point
of runoff in other words give them a
good saturating and be sure to spray on
the underside of the leaves and spray
the ground down around the bottom of the
plant because that's where the mold and
fungus and the bacterial wilt actually
comes from okay you get the idea
spray your tomato plants and now it's
important that you start early probably
within a week or so after you have set
the tomato plants out don't wait too
late
now you see these Tomatoes this is these
are cherry tomatoes and you see how
they're growing this trellis that I'm
standing under is about six feet high
and these tomatoes are a good two feet
to three feet higher than that up there
and then of course when they get up high
enough they just lay over and that's
what you see all this on here and you
just saw all of the green tomatoes
that's that's going on in here so let's
try one of the ripe tomatoes see what it
tastes like here we go with this one
mmm that's good
sweet got that a little bit of tart
tomato taste
let me see if I can find another one hey
you know what I'm gonna say now don't
you I wish I could give you this tomato
I wish I could give you this tomato just
to try it but can't do it you have to
get out there and plant your own
Tomatoes then grow this use my three
secrets grow some great Tomatoes let's
get on with mmm good and I need you
pretty sold oh that's still good
