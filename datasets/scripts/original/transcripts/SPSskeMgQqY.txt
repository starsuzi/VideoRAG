how's it going everyone today we're
going to be tanning a deer hide so this
video will be a conclusive video it will
cover
the steps from
flushing your hide all the way to the
actual tanning process so this video
will start after the deer has already
been skinned
now this video will span about five days
because the tanning process can take up
to five days depending on how well your
hide takes to the formula so this video
will be pieced together so don't mind
that
but we're going to jump right into it
we're going to start with the flushing
process we'll go over that quick so stay
with us
all right so this portion of the video
here is just me
flushing the deer hide
i would suggest
the night before sticking your hide
in a refrigerator just to cool it down
just to harden up some of the fat chunks
however i would not suggest sticking in
in the freezer
because that makes the fat chunks a
little too hard a little too hard to
take off of your hide itself
so you see i start here
with just using a regular skinner knife
just to loosen up some of the bigger
chunks before i get to my flushing knife
here
you can buy just a regular flushing
knife this one was 12 on amazon
and you're just going to take your
flushing knife start at the
base in the animal's neck
and just work your way down a deer hide
it's pretty tough so you can
[Music]
put some back into it
[Music]
it takes
maybe 10 15 minutes to completely flush
a deer
you'll see some smaller chunks still on
there some
hair like
chunks of fat on there which that will
come off in the salting process so we're
not going to worry too much about it
we're not going to get too picky with
our hide
but you're just going to work your
fleshing knife
all the way through your hide getting as
much of the fat off as you can
and
that is your flushing process
it's also pretty nice having a
outdoor cat who's very hungry for some
deer fat help you clean up some of your
mess
all right so now after you have your
hide completely flushed
you're going to fill up a
tote full of water
and you're going to fill it with
approximately
two of these
one pound ten ounce cans of salt now
this is table salt non-iodized you don't
want to use rock salt because that'll
your hair will start falling out of your
hide so you're gonna use this
non-iodized salt i've already poured two
of these in
and once you pour it in you're just
going to stir it up
all right then you're just going to take
your hide
and you're going to want to put it into
the water flush first
laying it over top of
the tote here
and it's crouched down
and just slowly
push it into the water
you want the flesh first
because the whole point of this process
is for the salt
to soak into the flesh
do that real quick
now you're going to be careful not to
overfill your bucket
because you do not want water all over
you're just going to stick that in there
and you're going to leave it
for 8 to 12 hours
okay
your water needs to be filled you can
just use tap water
and what you're going to want to do is
run your tap
as hot as it'll go
and then just let the water cool to room
temperature before you stick your hide
in there my hides a little bit cold a
little frozen because it was just
sitting outside for
about 10 minutes
but
that's all you do for this step you'll
let it go for like i said eight to 12
hours
checking on it halfway in between just
to see how it's coming along you just
want the salt to soak into your hide
so after
uh
our 8-12 is up this one's a smaller cape
so this will probably need about eight
hours maybe seven and a half or so once
it's done
i will
pull the video back up and we'll move on
to the next step
all right everyone
so we just finished
taking our hide
out of its salt bath here
and all i did was i just strung it up
here to the ceiling
to let it drip dry for the night
so we'll do that for a night let this
hang and drip dry and tomorrow we'll
wash all the dirt off and this excess
hair that got caught onto it during the
salting
so let this hang for the night and then
we'll pick it back up tomorrow morning
and start the tanning process
alright folks here we are it's the next
day
i just took this hide down
from it hanging up to dry
we're gonna be using this
um
deer hunters and trappers hide tanning
formula
and you can get it for like seven or
eight bucks a bottle
uh it says
to use it green
or to use it when the
hide is green
so we're going to imitate a green hide
here
by adding
a little bit of hot water
to the flesh
to try to loosen
the flesh up to make it more receptive
to this formula
so i just have a little bit of
water here i'm just going to take some
of it
and just splash it onto the hide here
it's all the more water we're going to
add to it
i'm just going to work this in
all right
so now the hide
looks you know
similar to what it would
when you just uh
flush it
so we're gonna throw this formula on and
see how it goes
we're going to take this
and just spread it on
right there you can see i've used
about that much you can see where it
starts
right there
so now we're just going to take this
formula
and just rub it in
all right so now when you are applying
your tanning formula you want to make
sure that you're hitting a little every
little crevice every crack every crease
every edge of the animals hide
it's very hard to over apply
tanning solution but it's very easy to
under apply
and once you apply your solution once
you don't want to go back over with more
solution
so
the first time count you want to make
sure that you're doing an excellent job
the very first time
so you get a good tan
i will leave a link to this product
in the description where you can buy
this i think amazon's probably the
cheapest place to get it
but now that it's off season it's
probably a little more money
but still we're gonna actually let this
sit
uh for the next
[Music]
day or so and then tomorrow
i will
look over this hide
and
if
the tanning solution has
worked its way into the flesh
then we'll be good to go and i can start
breaking the hide
so i'll pick you back up there we'll let
this sit overnight
and then i will see you again tomorrow
all right guys on this beautiful
2 degree
saturday morning
we are going to take the very last step
in tanning our deer hive
so now to this point
we've flushed the hide out
we have put in a salt bath we've washed
it with dawn dish soap after the salt
bath
and now
we are going to be breaking the leather
so to do this we're going to take our
hide
and we're just going to crinkle it back
and forth pull it separate it do
whatever you can
to turn the leather
from this
dark color you can see up top here
to this light color you can see down
towards the bottom here
now the outsides are a lot easier to do
than the inside
because the inside is a lot harder to
stretch apart than the outside of the
outside you can get two hands real easy
and start pulling
but the inside
you can't really do that you have to
have
somebody else pull it with you
or whatever so what i found easiest to
do is to take your hide
put it over something preferably with a
rounded edge i use my fleshing beam for
this
you're just going to run your hide
back and forth on whatever you have
just to kind of work it in you're going
to do this quick
just work it back and forth like that
and your hide
will start to separate on the inside the
fibers will start to separate you'll
start getting a wider color
now you don't have to have a flushing
beam reflection system or anything like
that for this process you could use a
two by four you can use a tree i see a
lot of people using trees
you just take it wrap it around the tree
and pull it back and forth
so
you'll leave it
sit in the tanning formula let it sit
overnight and each morning just come out
and break it just run it over something
and break it
until you have your finished product
i will continue to work this until done
and you guys can now start now you have
all the knowledge to do it but anyways
