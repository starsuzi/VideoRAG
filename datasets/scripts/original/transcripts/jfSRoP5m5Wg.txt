this is the midline video putting it all
together on how to set up the room when
you get in the patient's room and what
tools that you need out of the cart and
all about the kit so we're just going to
get started hi hi how are you today I'm
not feeling so good I'm so sorry
your your doctor has ordered a midline
catheter for you do you know what that
is no what is that it is a catheter that
goes in your upper arm and it's designed
to stay in for about 28 days or less and
it's a peripheral IV are you okay with
that sure okay what's your name
Amy URL and your date of birth save 1271
I thought you were going to say
something else like what like you were
younger or something and and then are
you allergic to anything Nina oh that's
a problem are you allergic to
polyurethane how can I know okay perfect
all right so I'm just going to get my
stuff together you'll see me doing a
whole bunch of stuff this is the midline
cart and in here we can go over later
where all the things are but for right
now we're just going to I'm just going
to tell you that you're going to need
lidocaine and saline you're going to
need a 10 cc syringe for a per flush the
extension set a TB syringe for your
local and sterile gloves and an
ultrasound probe cover and your actual
kit with the midline catheter in it and
you need your ultrasound machine I find
that the best thing to do is just to put
the patient's arm out make sure that
they're comfortable make sure that you
have something supporting the upper arm
like this and you're also going to need
a tourniquet first thing that you want
to do put the tourniquet on after you
position the patient's arm with the
tourniquet on open up your ultrasound
machine get your a probe and do your
anatomical survey here you want to look
for all of the veins
so do this find something that you like
that you think you know is going to be
work well for you and then you open up
the cake take the tourniquet off now put
your older sound pro back up here
because you're going to need it put a
sterile cover on it and that will help
you
there we go this packet of information
there is a sheet in here for the patient
this has a mask in a tourniquet and some
gloves in it you can use those if you
want to I don't use that tourniquet in
there because I wouldn't have opened the
kit before I took a look at the
ultrasound to see about the veins okay
start dropping your stuff
poultra sound probe cover 10 cc sir
where local syringe tension set
turn a kid up
I'm dropping this - this is gin careful
not to get so I'm dropping it
crap the arm
lower drape
can you lift up your arms
upper drink
and there we get almost there grab the
pro
don't get ultrasound goo on your hand
you
find your vein again
you want to draw up your local
these are all the things that are going
to happen to you they're happening to me
and you probably want to drop here
a better way to do that
localize your skin take your midline
catheter this is the way it looks we've
seen it before you want to enter in at a
rather shallow angle access the vein
once you access you can hold it either
this way this way you're going to have
to find the way that's best for you
access the vein we're going to anchor
this hand down so stick access and we
won't do that to Amy today and then put
the wire out using the white initial
step and then take the flanges and put
out catheter just like that let her know
11 dissipated
you can put the ultrasound machine down
you would take a picture first once you
access the vein you want to the picture
okay now say this is in any skin and
you're going to take your flush and your
extension set push your extension to it
hook it up and then proceed with your
dressing dressing comes with a guard Eva
you want to put the guard Eva on if your
patient is allergic to cortex City and
you cannot use this put it on this side
up put it with the slit facing down and
then take your skin protectant put that
on there put your stat block on here and
put your tugga demo on
well up midline is done how are you good
yes there you go finished
