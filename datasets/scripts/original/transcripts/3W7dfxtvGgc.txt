[Music]
so in here i've started a very basic
milk sauce flour and butter whisk it
together for just a minute you don't
want it to color then add in one cup of
milk and a half a cup of cream this is
going to be for a creamy mexican poblano
sauce to make our mexican turkey corn
and mushroom casserole
so once i get the cream in there i'm
just going to let this thicken up nice
and gently
while i literally pulverize in my
uh high-power uh blender here or you can
use your food processor at home
one cup of turkey stock that's to help
everybody get along or you can use
chicken stock
you know makes it move while it's pureed
and then these are all raw guys
a handful of cilantro
three raw poblano peppers seed them
first and then just coarsely chop them a
couple of cloves of garlic
and one onion chopped
[Music]
and just puree it up
then we're gonna let this
cook out in our milk sauce for about 20
to 25 minutes
now i've got about three quarters of a
pound of button mushrooms or you can use
cremini mushrooms if you like a beefier
flavor to your mushrooms once they're
cooked out
now i'm gonna add a little butter to
some olive oil turn the heat up on this
pan
and you're gonna brown the mushrooms by
themselves before you add any other
ingredients to the pan also hold off on
salting them so they get browner a
little faster for you
all right let's get these guys in there
[Music]
now once your mushrooms are really
fragrant and nice and tender then we're
gonna add in four ears of corn on the
cob scraped down or two cups of corn
kernels defrosted
gonna let the sugars in the corn develop
a little
and i'm gonna
tender up
and develop the sugars in a couple of
large shallots chopped as well
two large shallots
now we can add our salt and pepper as
well
[Music]
give this a stir
[Music]
to that i'm going to add the last of my
leftover turkey
five or six cups and remember you can
make this with rotisserie chicken the
whole rest of the year long
then just to keep this saucy and a
little bit moist
i'm going to sprinkle a little of that
turkey stock or you could use chicken
stock of course down over the top
just a cup or so
so now i'm going to take half of my
casserole base mixture here
the corn
mushroom and chunky turkey
pop that in the bottom
of our dish
sauce this up
with about half of our poblano sauce
[Music]
missed a little pocket over here
even distribution of sauce is important
in casserole building
then
charred tortillas
i find that three makes a nice even
layer that you can still cut through
when you go to serve
and some cheeks
then i'm going to layer it in a little
differently up on top here
we're going to go all the rest of our
filling
[Music]
and squish her down there
then we're going to go tortillas
then we want to keep these moist when
they cook
then i'm going to spoon over my extra
sauce
[Music]
and then i'm going to cap that
with more cheese
now you cool this and store this this is
your make ahead meal this casserole the
night you want to serve
bring it back to room temperature and
then pop it in a hot oven 375 even 400
degrees and bake it until it's deeply
bubbly and brown all over the top
a tex mex turkey dish turkey mushroom
and corn casserole
