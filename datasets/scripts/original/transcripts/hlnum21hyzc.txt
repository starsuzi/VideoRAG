hi I'm Jessica Hillman and I'm 18 years
old a young missionary here at natural
baptist orphanage i'm here to tell you
about the pillowcase dresses they were
made by women in the states with love
for all of these young girls here what
happens is they take a regular
pillowcase it might have a design on it
and they take the top they cut it in a
NAU and they insert a beautiful ribbon
which matches the pillowcase after the
ribbons are inserted on both sides the
girls can tie bows on each of their
shoulders and at the bottom sometimes
there's a really pretty lace or some
kind of border all of these girls have
been very excited to receive these
because it's Easter and now their
feeling is beautiful as God made them
you
