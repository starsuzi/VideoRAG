so what you do is you get a nice size
dollop on the end of your
spatula and you plop it on your cupcake
and Pat it around a little bit so it's
nice and smooth around the edges and
then start from over here and you go all
the way around and back the other
way and then you sprinkle it
getting a dollop right it's all smooth
and happy and you're aiming for the
middle and you just start
patting you're just homogenizing it
you're making it look round and then you
make a ridge all the way
around and you bring it back the other
way and pull up at the exact same time
you get the
swirl that looks so easy
give it a shot okay this give be a
really good one right here a perfect
Edge and then all right so you want to
start off with a clean knife all right
you got your cupcake and you kind of
cradle it in your hand and you grab a
nice rounded little dollop right you're
going to aim straight for the cake in
the middle and you just start patting it
all you're doing is you're lifting it up
so that it creates a rounded shape right
so all we're doing is making a little
Ridge you're kind of at an angle with
your knife and you go all the way around
360s right as soon as you reach that
team you go the other way and you lift
up the exact same time and you get
the so go ahead and give it a
[Applause]
shot you are doing just great so
far but the whole point is to have fun
so it doesn't matter what they look like
they're still going to taste just as
good so you're getting that Ridge in
there you go all the way around see my
knife is slightly angled and I'm just
twisting the cake so it's creating that
Ridge you go all the way around again
and you lift up and out to create that
