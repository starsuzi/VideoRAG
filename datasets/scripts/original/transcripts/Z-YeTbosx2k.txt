creating a Works sited entry for a poem
is very similar to creating a Works
sited entry for a short story novel
article Etc it's creating the intext
citation or parenthetical citation
that's a little
different the introductory paragraph
that we see here is off to a really good
start but we as readers would grasp what
the author means to say much more
readily if the author brought in actual
text from the poem
the author decides to site lines one
through four to accomplish this goal
note how the author has introduced the
quote by saying he opens the poem by
saying rather than just dropping his
quotes in now the author has to
punctuate and cite the quote correctly
back slashes go at the end of each line
to show where the author has
introduced line
breaks and all capitalization and
punctuation is left the same that we
have periods before our uh back
slashes the parenthetical citation will
include the author's last
name unless the text around it has made
it clear that you're talking about a
dose passive poem and in this case it is
pretty clear so we can actually skip
that part and instead of entering page
numbers for the poem we're going to
enter line numbers so here we'll just
have one through four
put a period at the end and then you're
done
