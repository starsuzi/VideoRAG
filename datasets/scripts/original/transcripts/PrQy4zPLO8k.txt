this is Chef Chris with Market Street
today we're going to be caramelizing
onions it's a very simple way of getting
the full flavor and sweetness out of
these onions I go ahead and I cut both
ends
off rud end and the other end cut it in
half and then I peel I've already peeled
this one a little bit but you can see
there's a another layer there I like to
peel that second layer off always you
can cut them this way if you feel more
safe where the onion doesn't roll around
on you but if you're proficient with a
knife you can cut it this way and this
is the way I like to do it I'm going to
go ahead and turn the heat on this pan
to high notice I'm using a fairly large
pan we don't want our onions to be
crowded in this pan because we don't
want them to steam we want them to
caramelize or brown I'm going to put
about a/4 cup worth of oil in this
pan I've got four large onions cut up
here and we're going to go ahead and
just add our onions to
that and you can use a spatula and turn
it around but I like to just kind of
flip them around and try not to get
them
everywhere you see I got them coated
with oil really
nicely we want to keep our
heat once it gets high we want to turn
that down to about medium high we're
going to leave them like this and stir
them every four 5 minutes until they get
a nice caramel dark brown
color okay it's been about 30 minutes
and as you can see these onions cook
down really nicely and you see their
nice golden color and all the
caramelization and uh when we come back
I'll be using on a caramelized onion and
goat cheese pizza
