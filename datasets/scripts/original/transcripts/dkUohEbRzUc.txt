The Messor colony!
Some months ago there have been just a few
of them.
They took care of their brood, raised their
sisters.
They have started consuming more and more
proteins.
Today they have a giant brood chamber.
This colony is growing so extremely fast.
Their formicarium is slowly getting to small.
I decided to make a bigger one for them.
Welcome to the AmazingAnts Channel and have
fun watching the modification from a aquarium
to a formicarium!
I am starting to drill the chambers into the
cinder block.
Therefore I use drills with a size between
15 and 25 mm.
After that I use a screwdriver to smooth the edges.
For the bigger paths I use a 8 mm drill.
Okay, the chambers are ready.
I really like the look of 
the new nest!
Let's have a look if everything fits like
planed.
Nice! Everything is fine. Okay, let's go on guys.
For the next step we need plaster and clay.
Mix it 50/50.
Mix it with water and stir until it is one
liquid.
This color is only used for the chambers.
After drying I use pure clay with water to
get a darker brown color.
I fixed the three nest parts with silicone
in the aquarium.
After that I glued Plexiglas on the top of
the cinder blocks to raise up the floor level.
The two cinder blocks are used as pillars
for the thin Plexiglas.
The last step is the ground, therefore I use
a mixture of red sand, clay, white sand and
small black stones.
The formicarium is ready!
