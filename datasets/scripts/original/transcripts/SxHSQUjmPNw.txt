hey Blake here
and right now I want to show you how to
make an Amaretto Sour okay an amoretto
sour is served in a highball glass but
we're going to build the drink in a 16 o
mixing
glass 3/4 of the way full of ice on that
we're going to pour an ounce and a half
of Amaretto two Mississippi three
Mississippi okay that's an ounce and a
half then we'll take our sweet and sour
homemade sweet and sour sour and we'll
pour that another 3 oz of that and to
this we're going to squeeze one lemon
wedge one lime wedge and one orange
wedge right down in the drink we're
going to give this a nice
shake and pour this directly into the
serving
glass okay we're going to garnish this
with an
orange a cherry and a straw and that is
a great amoretto sour cheers
