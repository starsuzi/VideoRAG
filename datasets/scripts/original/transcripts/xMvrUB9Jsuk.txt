one, two, three, four!
Rev up your engines!
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel
today I'm going to show
you how you can make your car look
better and actually last longer at the
same time and if you do it yourself you
can do it at a pretty low cost
now these headlights have a lot of fade
on them they're plastic and they're ten
years old but they fade for one main
reason they have daylight running lamps
and the heat will often make them get
foggy halogen lamps burn pretty hot
let's see what the temperature is with the
this temperature gun, go down here and
measured it's over eight hundred and
sixty-seven degrees now let's check the
temperature of these LED headlights
instead there are only a hundred and
twenty eight degrees the LEDs run so
much cooler they're not going to warp
the plastic they're not going to make it
get cloudy I love using these LED
replacement bulbs because when I put on
these beautiful black edged lens
assemblies they're not going to get all
melted and distorted like the old ones
because I'm using an LED bulb that runs
much cooler now we're going to change
out the lens assembly there's one bolt
here and one bolt here but
unfortunately there's another bolt on
the bottom so we take these two bolts
off but now we have to access this bolt
that's underneath so we'll jack up the
car and the last bolt is here so it's
going to be right about here we got to
take the bumper cover off to get to that
it's not that big of a deal you just
flip the plastic liner out and you unbolt the bolts that are up here holding
it in place they come off then from the
outside you pull and the little snaps
come off and you can reach the bolt to
take off with and there is the little
devil right there, you take it out, and
with a little wiggling perhaps a little
swearing out it comes, goodbye old faded
one hello nice shiny black one then you
wiggle the new one in and bolt it in
place get them nice and snug then snap
the bumper cover back into it's hole here
it snaps in and put the two bolts back
into here and just look at the
difference here's a new one with a black
and the LED and here's the old faded
original equipment one and let's face it
what would you rather have this or this
doesn't look nearly as cool and since
there's an LED in there now it runs so
much cooler it won't melt the plastic as
much and it won't fade as fast you get
two for the price of one and look at the
difference with the lights on here's the
new one and there's the old one with all
the faded light coming through I got all
this stuff for less than a hundred and
fifty bucks total on Amazon I'm not
gonna tell you which one because this
isn't it advertisement it's just something
I decided to do and for an extra 65
bucks I'm doing the back to look at this
difference there's he new one there's
the ugly old one which would you rather
have and remember you got any car
questions just visit the Scotty Kilmer
channel and I'll answer them as soon as
I make it out of this fallout shelter
