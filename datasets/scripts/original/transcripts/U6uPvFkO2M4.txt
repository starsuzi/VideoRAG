i'm actually going to make the stuffing
in this case but
if you have leftover stuffing by all
means just use that so this is basically
two boxes of the traditional like
chicken or turkey flavored stuffing and
you want to prepare it according to
package directions so the directions in
this case call for
some water and some butter and i'm just
going to let that butter and water come
to a boil and then i'm going to add my
dry stuffing mix hey that's right i
almost forgot i promised you pictures so
i have a few pictures i wanted to show
you from over the weekend took some
great pictures
of a couple of things first of all
i have some pictures my daughter ireland
was in the high school musical over the
weekend and
she's she's grown up she's a sophomore
in high school and here she is the
musical was called anything goes put on
by her high school notre dame
in green bay and um the the story is
about um shenanigans that take place on
a cruise ship there's it's just a really
cute story and so um here she is with
some of the other cast mates
is dancing and singing it was a really
fun show they all the cast did a great
job and so did the orchestra so took
some cute pictures so very very fun
exciting to be a proud mom and dad
watching your daughter up on stage if
you've ever had that experience before
it's just it's a really cool experience
also had my first holiday book signing
of the season
and met the sweetest little lady this is
four-year-old jordan she watches the
show with grandma all the time so
hopefully she's watching right now
grandma says that she comes and gets
grandma in the kitchen and says amy's on
amy's on so i love that and i think
they're going to do some holiday baking
together so jordan and grandma and mom
and jordan's brother thanks for coming
out to see me at cook's corner lots more
holiday book signings still to come this
season so
hope to see you there okay so
i butter and my water is boiling at this
point i'm going to add my dried stuffing
just turn off the heat mix it in here
and then we'll fluff it with a fork when
it gets all done okay
okay so this is a casserole so i'm going
to make a really nice creamy gravy
that's
going to work with the stuffing and the
leftover turkey so this recipe starts
out with actually two cans of cream of
mushroom soup
i am so getting excited for thanksgiving
it's like bring it on
ready for the mashed potatoes and the
stuffing and
the holiday music and
got the christmas tree up
had some light issues yesterday is it is
it just me does anybody else have light
issues when you put up the christmas
tree
yesterday we like blew a circuit or
something i mean like it's a whole thing
it's just a whole thing
uh so anyway
but i'm happy to report ann it's all
good today now tonight it might be
a whole nother thing so yikes
usually it's like you get them all up on
the tree and like one strand doesn't
work you know and then you have to take
them all off again oh my gosh i did test
them we do test them
of course i test them
oh anne says you can avoid the whole
thing all together without putting the
tree up oh bah humbug
so anyway the next next week we're going
to start doing some holiday decorating
and and give you some ideas of
fun ideas you can do in in your home
this year the theme
is vintage in my house actually vintage
more vintage 50 60. so i'm excited to
see how it all
comes together
okay so two cans of cream of mushroom
soup and then we're gonna add to that
some sour cream i love using cream
soups in the base of my casserole but i
want to take them to a whole other level
and and have them have some really great
flavor so sour cream is one way to do
that
to get rid of that canned soup taste a
little bit of dry white wine is another
great way to
you know just kind of take a casserole
the flavors of casserole to a whole new
level and when it cooks when it bakes
it'll it'll boil and the alcohol part
will boil out but you're just going to
be left with some great flavor we're
using dora peninsula's white wine
so just a little splash of that will do
and some milk
so we've got some lemurs milk here
all right
and you can get the full recipe for this
on our website by the way this is one of
my tried and true favorites
some black pepper
dried parsley
and a little bit of garlic salt
you'll notice quite a bit of liquid in
this casserole and that's because
we've got the stuffing on top and i
really want this to be a you know
lots of gravy
so i'm going to use a whisk and whisk
this together
next week we have some really fun things
planned i know tis the season after
thanksgiving starts all that great
holiday baking
so we have all sorts of fun cookie
recipes and candy recipes and decorating
recipes
all sorts of really wonderful holiday
recipes lots of fun new shows
it all starts monday or holiday season
they're going to be decorating our
kitchen set here for the holidays so
super excited about that okay and in
goes now our leftover turkey
so whatever you have two to three four
cups of leftover turkey
it dice it up chunk it up however you
want to do it
this recipe also works great with
chicken so if you've got a rotisserie
chicken you want to shred that up you
could use that
but i got a big turkey this year so i
have a feeling we're gonna have lots of
leftovers
one of my favorites is just a really
good
turkey sandwich um
after thanksgiving like the next day oh
love that
on those squishy rolls you know those
really soft ones a little bit of mayo
and maybe some lettuce and tomato okay
so nice big casserole dish
and we're gonna take our turkey mixture
and get it into our dish
smells delicious the one in the oven
tomorrow on the show more things to do
with all those leftovers
we're going to make a great big batch of
southwest turkey soup which is actually
really healthy okay so let's fluff up
our stuffing a little bit
and again this is a perfect way to use
leftover stuffing so you're just going
to kind of sprinkle the stuffing over
the top
up
and then i've got some melted butter
some butter that i'm just going to melt
to drizzle that over the top you don't
have to do that but that's going to give
these
the stuffing
a nice crispness
and by the way if you have any great
holiday recipes we love hearing about
them so please share go to our website
tell us about your recipes who knows we
may even have you on the show come cook
with me sometime so it's always fun
getting your recipes
so what i like to do is after i drizzle
the butter over the top park this in the
fridge if you're making this ahead of
time
otherwise bake it with covered in foil
for about 30 minutes and then uncover it
so that the topping gets a little bit
crispy
so this butter just get drizzled over
the top
and then again this casserole gets
covered with foil makes for about 30
minutes covered and then uncovered the
last 15-20 minutes until
the top is it's bubbly and the top is
nice and golden okay
come back with me
this still has a little bit to go so i
think i'm going to let it bake a little
bit longer and just leave it in there
and i'll show you what it looks like in
just a bit but man does it smell
fantastic and it really is kind of a
taste of thanksgiving and we'll put the
recipe on our website
coming up some last minute other ideas
for thanksgiving we've got some fun gift
ideas we're making the cutest ever
pilgrim cupcakes a spiced cider that
we're going to be doing and
cranberry honey muffins too so don't go
anywhere we'll be back
