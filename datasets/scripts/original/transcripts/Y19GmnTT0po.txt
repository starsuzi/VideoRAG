can you use rubbing alcohol to get
acrylic paint out of your clothes let's
see if this can works I have the school
uniform pants that my youngest daughter
got some acrylic craft paint on the
other day while we're making garden
stones outside I saw a pin on Pinterest
that said if you use rubbing alcohol
we'll be able to remove the paint after
beating by rubbing alcohol I put a dish
towel in the pants leg of my daughter's
uniform so that way whenever I go to
clean the stain it's not going to seep
through to the other side
[Music]
the pin said to put so much alcohol on
there that it was saturated
[Music]
after applying the alcohol I started
scratching the spot with my fingernail
[Music]
here's the mark after about five minutes
of hard scrubbing with my fingernail not
much more is coming off so I decided to
apply some more alcohol and just let it
sit for a minute
now that it's set on their frontal but I
took a butter knife and I scraped a bit
along the grain of the fabric it seemed
to work pretty good it's a lot lighter
now here's what the pants look like
right fresh from the dryer
there's no stain at all everything's
gone the alcohol and the knife works I'm
so happy I don't have to buy new uniform
pants for my daughter so this is a
totally successful pin my daughter has
no more acrylic paint on her pants I did
not have to buy any new uniforms
life is good if you have any kids in
your life that love to paint and make
messes or maybe you describe your
alcohol because it works this pin was a
total success go try it at home
