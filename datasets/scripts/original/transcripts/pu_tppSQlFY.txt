hi i'm shawn from eve organics and today
we're going to show you how to make your
own natural insect repellent
okay so here's the items you're going to
need to get started today we're going to
start with a four ounce spray bottle is
what we're going to mix ours in but you
can adjust the recipe to suit whatever
size you want to do
so
the first item you're gonna need is
witch hazel and you can substitute witch
hazel for a vodka that you might have
handy at home
and then you're gonna need three
essential oils you can always add more
than these but you're gonna definitely
want these three to get started
uh eucalyptus
basil
and lavender
and then optionally you can also add
glycerin um this will help keep
everything mixed together properly so go
ahead and gather your ingredients and
we'll be right back to show you how to
make the recipe
okay if you've gathered all your
ingredients we're ready to get started
um you're gonna start with uh your four
ounces of witch hazel or vodka
and to that you're gonna add each of
your three essential oils you're going
to need a half teaspoon of each
essential oil
just drop that into the witch hazel
the first one i added was lavender
and now i'm putting in the sweet basil
half a teaspoon
and lastly
we will be adding the eucalyptus a half
teaspoon again
and as i mentioned optionally if you
want to use the glycerin if you have it
handy you're going to want a half
teaspoon
of the glycerin to add to your mixture
and then go ahead and mix it all
together real well
and then you can go ahead and pour it
into your spray bottle
if you have a funnel that will keep you
from spilling any
and there you go you're all set to
go explore the outdoors
so you can use some different essential
oils or add to them not different but
add to what we've given you in this
recipe
this one smells really good there's
really no reason to but if you wanted to
experiment a little you could these
three essential oils are proven to be
highly effective in insect insect
repellent because they're high in
geranial
