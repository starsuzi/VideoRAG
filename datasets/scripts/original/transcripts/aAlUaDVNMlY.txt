a mandolin is a utensil with a variety
of blades for slicing fruits and
vegetables uniformly or creating perfect
juliens which are Matchstick strips most
people find that trying to create thin
uniform slices using just a knife is
difficult but a mandolin takes all the
struggle out of it I want to show you a
couple of different kinds of
mandolins this is a borner brand V
slicer it comes with a slicing disc it
has a thin side and a thick side and you
can tell the difference because on the
thick side the lines are spaced further
apart it also comes with a Julien disc
which you can use to create those
Matchstick strips this is the thin julen
disc it comes with a thick and a
thin it also comes with a safety hat and
you can position many vegetables on the
safety hat so that your hand never comes
close to the blade
alternatively you can use a cut
resistant glove and that's what this is
here this comes separately but I love
the cut resistant glove because then
even if my hand were to accidentally
Nick this blade my fingers would be
perfectly safe so this is really
handy the next kind of mandolin I want
to show you is a Kera brand ceramic
mandolin now this one only slices but
they also make a separate julienning
mandolin what I love about this one is
you can create ultra thin slices it's
really thin and also it's lightweight so
this is easy to just hold right over
your salad bowl and make a few thin
shavings of onion or cucumber directly
into your salad so let's start off with
the borner V slicer first I want to show
you how to slice a whole
onion so I'm going to go ahead and
remove one of the ends of the
onion and I'm going to score the peel
which means just moving my knife just
slightly through the the peel so that
it's easy to
remove I can take off the
peel now that I peeled the onion I can
put it on the prongs of the safety hat
I'll just insert it right into those
prongs it's nice and
stable and now I'm going to make thin
slices this will come out as rings
and now I have perfect thin Rings this
would be very difficult to do by
hand next I want to show you how a juli
and a cucumber using the borner V slicer
first I'm going to peel the Cucumber
cucumber peels are very nutritious but
they're a little bit tough so for a more
pleasing texture I'll start with a
peeled cucumber
just go ahead and peel
it now I'm going to fit the V slicer
with the Julien
disc now I could use the safety hat on
this but it would be a little bit
awkward and unstable so I'm going to go
ahead and use the cut resistant glove
just to make sure my fingers are totally
safe so first I'll make long
julen now I'm approaching the seed bed
in the middle of the Cucumber the seeds
are perfectly edible but they're not
always the most pleasing texture so what
I'll do is rotate the cucumber and just
continue julienning on all four sides
I could save this bed of seeds for cream
of cucumber soup or a creamy cucumber
dressing I think I can get a couple more
Julian out of
it these Julianne strips are a little
bit long so what I'm going to do is just
cut them into 1in pieces to make them
more
manageable it would be really hard to
get perfect Julian like this using just
a knife but now I can add these to
salads or sushi rolls and they're going
to look beautiful as well as taste
delicious next I want to show you how to
thinly slice cabbage using both the
borner V slicer and the ceramic
mandolin so the first step is to remove
some of the wilted outer leaves from the
Cabbage I'll just remove a couple of
these leaves
next I'm going to cut the Cabbage into
quarters now I can remove some of the
tough core with my chef's knife I'll
just cut it at an
angle but I could save this core for
juicing it makes really good green
juice now I'm going to fit the slicer
with the thin slicing disc
again and I'll put on that cut resistant
glove and I can make really thin
slices here we've got some beautiful
thin slices those would be great on a
salad or for coal
sloth just for comparison I want to show
you how to slice the Cabbage using the
Kera ceramic mandolin it's going to make
even finer
shreds we'll take another quarter of
cabbage and remove the core
put on the cut resistant glove
again and I'll go ahead and
Shad these are really delicate paper
fine shreds this cabbage almost tastes
cooked it's so
tender I want to show you a couple more
vegetables using the Kera ceramic
mandolin first I'll show you how to
thinly slice a red onion into half Moons
sometimes I find that raw onion is a
little bit sharp but if I slice it extra
thin it's mild and delicious so we'll
start off by removing one end of the
onion next I'm going to cut the onion in
half lengthwise through the
root now the peel comes off really
easily put on that that cut resistant
glove
again and I can thinly slice the
onion These Fine slices of onion would
be perfect on top of my
salad finally I want to show you had a
thinly slice of cucumber using the
ceramic mandolin I could do this right
over my salad bowl into my salad
look at these perfect slices it would be
really difficult to do that with a
knife if you're going to be making raw
dishes that are packed with healthy
veggies you'll be doing lots of slicing
and if you start using a mandolin you'll
find that it quickly begins to feel like
one of your best friends
