hey guys miss allegar here you're
watching another video on how to create
your works cited page and this time
we're looking at citing books stories
poems and songs
first things first we're going to take a
look at books okay so the book that i'm
using is the valley of amazement by amy
tan
now easybib does this pretty cool thing
where if you just input the title of
your book and click cite this they're
going to give you a list of results and
typically it's your first one so what i
did for here was clicked select
and what it did was lead me to this page
which should be familiar for most of you
and it tells me that i'm missing some
publication information so where would i
find that typically you're going to find
that in the first couple pages of the
book
and it's asking for the publisher
city and year and if i were to look at
my
publication information i can find that
it was
printed by harpercollins publishers and
that they are located in new york and
that is this was published in 2013.
so i go ahead and put that information
right here into these three boxes i
don't need anything else here so i would
click create citation
but some of you guys are only working on
chapters or short stories sections of
books so
you would click on this menu right here
and instead you would select
the
chapter
or section
option
and it should lead you to a page that
looks like this
so once you've got this
you can pretty much
this should select automatically you're
going to input your chapter section
title right here
and for the most part you guys are going
to be looking at the chapter essay poem
or short story so go ahead and put in
the title of the poem or the chapter or
the short story in there you can also
include in the page numbers
if you're using or referencing the
entire story then that's not a problem
but say you're only using
a couple pages from the article you are
going to want to input them here
right there and then you can go ahead
and click create citation
and once you've done that you'll have
your citation ready to go
now setting signs a little bit different
so we are going to go over a couple of
things here the first thing you need to
do is to absolutely 100
cite the artist and not the writer so
say you are looking at a
band
oh this might not this needs to be
flipped around okay so you would be
citing maroon 5 instead of adam levine
fun instead of nate ruiz and
led zeppelin instead of just robert
plant you may also need some additional
information
and this might require you to use our
good old friend google
and you would then
search your artist name the song title
and the word album so i have the example
here where i search maroon 5 she will be
loved album
okay and it's absolutely okay if you get
the label and the album release
information from wikipedia you're not
going to be citing it so it's not a
problem
so let's go over how to format your
citations so you're going to start with
your artist name followed by period
then you're going to put your song title
and the period
inside the quotation marks your album
title
needs to be
italicized
so make sure you do that
okay then your label name and the year
the album is released okay make sure you
put that comma
okay it is not a period there it's going
to be a comma so i've got two examples
for you the first being a band so maroon
5 and we're talking about the song this
love so as you can see here is your
album which i italicized
is produced by j records in 2002. now if
you've got a solo artist with a first
name and a last name you're going to
want to do
the last name first
and the first name last
okay make sure you put that comment
between to indicate that that is their
last name that comes first and you
pretty much follow the same format as
before your song title and the
quotations italicize album label and
gear okay so if you've got any other
questions about citations please bring
them to class or email me
and if there are other things that
you're looking for specifically the
sighting of databases or websites or
youtube you can check out some of the
other videos in the series thanks for
