in the United States kosher consumers do
not need to check flour for infestation
at this time if signs of insect presence
are noticed however the flower must be
checked this tutorial describes the
signs of flower infestation and methods
to protect flour products from
insects Special Care should be taken by
those using flour that has been stored
for some time such as yashan or last
year's matam often insect eggs have
matured and hatched by this time only
insects that are visible with the eye
present a cautious

problem this is true even if the bug is
not discernible without magnification
but can only be seen as a speck insects
that cannot be seen at all such as eggs
that are common in flour and other foods
do not present a cautious problem
because of their microscopic size
when opening the
flower notice if there are small holes
in the

surface this would indicate the presence
of the red or confused flower
Beetle these red beetles are easy to see
on the surface of the flower but quickly
burrow into the flower when exposed to
light or
[Music]
activity also watch for small black
spots these beetles are about half the
size of the letters on a nickel it takes
a strong magnifying glass or microscope
to distinguish them from dirt
particles often the flow will be
speckled with these spots when
infested look for webbing moth larvae
produce this webbing where they are
feeding flour or meal stick to the
webbing and is easy to detect by the
stringy masses of
material to prevent infestation many
people keep flour in the freezer this
may work if the temperature stays at 0Â°
Centigrade for 4 days at this
temperature the eggs will
die if infested flour is found scrub
containers with soap and hot water make
sure to remove all the flour particles
that adhere to the sides of the
container as these are commonly insect
eggs which are coated with a sticky
secretion and become covered with flour
once cleaned in this way containers will
be safe for use
