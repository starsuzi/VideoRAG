all going welcome to life tast uh it's
it's use up uh leftover stuff day I like
that uh I opened the fridge looking for
what I could make always fond of using
things up I saw some uh bacon I saw some
Parmesan I saw some cream so we're
making a carbonara nice simple little
carbonara I've
cooked about uh half a pound of bacon
sorry got to get used to my new little
thing here please tell me you'll cut
that out that's why I got two cameras
down I've uh I've cooked about a half a
pound of bacon it's just getting to the
crispy point now traditional
carbonara is made with like spaghetti I
suppose you can use anything and I'm
using this
orzo orzo which is it's an actual pasta
can you see that of course oh my God go
show clothes look it looks like rice
it's an actual pasta so I'm using that
uh asparagus is not a typical add to it
but I'm going to add it because because
I want to and because we can so I'm just
going to cut these into little pieces
you cook the orzo about uh 8 to 10
minutes they have been in the water the
Oro look has been in the water about
four five minutes so I'm going to add
this asparagus just throw it in let it
all happen at the same
time ah hot that's ready let's just do
one more little junk of these to go in
and that will just cook the same
time the orzo is finishing
right
so here's what we need back up for a sec
Junior I need some cream which is
here I need an egg yolk which is
here which will be here and I need some
Parmesan which is here I mean look I'm
down to the bones on all this stuff so
in a little
bowl I'm going to
put one egg
yolk you know how to separate an egg
right yeah like
that and like that get rid of this
mush get rid of that so just the yolk
assuming you don't have a separator you
don't need a separator when you've got
hands young
Maxwell
now take a
fork turn this down a
bit a/4 cup of cream in here that looks
like one two
three four
tablespoons eat that
up
splatter good let's check out and see
what's going on
here
beautiful
asparagus needs 2
minutes
youro I can see still needs a couple
minutes well look at
me I'm ready with almost nothing to do
so here while we're waiting
let's just get a little parmesan ready
shall
we if I could just find my stuff if
people will just put my things back
where I know they go I'm not even
freaking here man I'm looking for my
microplane
zester which is nowhere to be
found so we'll just get this cheese
happening
parmesan I mean I used to buy the
pre-made parmesan sorry the pre-shredded
it's just not nearly as good not even
close to being
good so I like to buy a wedge of it now
and look it's definitely more
expensive but it's really outstanding
the flavor is 10 times the stuff that
comes pre-shredded in a
bag and I'm hot all of a sudden I'm
super hot are you hot
mhm I need like all of
this oh this is going to be very
good just get this little kid
here
all
right so we want to hang on to a little
bit of the pasta water to help thin this
and whenever you're making pasta keep
back a little bit of the pasta
water because if you need to thin
something it's already got the flavor of
the pasta in it
right as opposed to using just water
like out of the
sink
so I'll keep a little bit of this right
here without asparagus in
it there's that and now this is
done so let's strain
this and the asparagus has cooked while
the orzo was cooking and now we come
over
here here's our crispy bacon I like the
grease in here you're going to be fine
with
that let's get this a little
hot and that goes
in so now let's mix
this just get the flavor of the bacon
through everything
here we'll add a little the pasta water
now and
ready the
egg goes
in and the Egg and the cream we're going
to start
to check this out oh it's nice look it
look how beautiful creamy this is going
to get
lovely
right the
cheese goes
in the rest of this little pasta
water turn this down look how
beautifully creamy this
is
okay two things
Max of course
Salt but heavy pepper there's nothing
like
parmesan the egg this pasta with a good
dose of fresh ground pepper
here
boom this is going to be
unbelievable it's done
let's just look at a little of it right
here
that maybe a little extra cheese on
top and we're
done check it out check it out check it

cooked perfectly along with the rest of
the
orzo that's a nice
bite bacon pepper cheese oh my God it's
