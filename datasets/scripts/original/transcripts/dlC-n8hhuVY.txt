Nutella.....its taken the world by storm
and with good reason why
it has such an amazing flavor to it
so today I´m going to show you guys how to make
Nutella pillows with a homemade raspberry puree
these Nutella pillows have a soft cloud like texture
and when you dip them into the raspberry puree
you create this gorgeous explosion of flavors
you can serve these for dessert
as a snack or even for breakfast :)
ok this recipe is easy to make
and you know everyone is going to love these
we´re going to get started
by making our raspberry puree first
add 1 cup of fresh raspberries into a sauce pan
also add 2 tablespoons of white sugar
and 1 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice
hit it with a medium heat
and start mixing all the ingredients together
after cooking this between 3 to 4 minutes
and all the sugar has dissolved
transfer the raspberry mixture
into a sieve with a bowl underneath
and start mixing the mixture around
once you´re left with nothing but the seeds
discard the seeds
and transfer the raspberry puree into a bowl
cover it with seran wrap
and add it to the fridge
ok we´re moving on to the dough
add 1 cup of all-purpose flour into a bowl
also add 1 teaspoon of baking powder
1/2 a teaspoon of white sugar
and 1/2 a teaspoon of sea salt
and mix all the dry ingredients together
then add 1 tablespoon of extra virgin Spanish olive oil
and 1/3 cup of water
and start mixing it together
once you reach a dough like texture
get in there with your hands
and start kneading it inside of the bowl
between 1 to 2 minutes
then you want to shape it into a ball
sprinkle some all-purpose flour on a flat surface
add the ball of dough on top
and using the palm of your hands
start pushing down on the dough
now I´m going to grab a roller
and start rolling out the dough
I´m looking for a rectangular shape
that has a thickness between 1/8 to 1/16 of an inch
now we´re going to cut some vertical lines
that are about 4 inches apart
and now we´re going to cut 2 horizontal lines
now let´s get to the star of the dish
Nutella
I´m going to be adding about
1/2 a tablespoon of Nutella to each piece of dough
then I´m going to fold the dough
in the shape of a triangle
I´m going to get in there with a fork
and start piercing the outer edges on both sides
that way they are well sealed
and with each one that I finish
I´m going to transfer it to a baking tray
that´s lined with parchment paper
ok now we´re going to add our baking tray
into a pre-heated oven bake and broil option
190 C - 375 F
for exactly 7 minutes
our Nutella pillows are done!
so now I´m going to start plating the dish
I´m going to add the raspberry puree to a plate
then add a couple of the Nutella pillows
and sprinkle them with some powdered sugar on top
and garnish the dish with some fresh raspberries
ok now I´m going to crack one of these open
and give it a try
and look how beautiful that came out...here we go
Salud!
it´s so good
the dough is perfectly cooked
it´s soft and chewy
and then the combination
between the Nutella and the raspberry  puree
is simply stunning
