good day everyone I'm Eliza abello and
I'm GL Delani we would like to
demonstrate to you and how to apply hot
compress and cold compress and we would
also like to show to you that
communication is important in every
nursing procedure yes and for that I
will be the one to demonstrate the hot
compress and I will be the one to
demonstrate the cold compress so Eliza
will be my patient this so now I will
perform the procedure called compress
called compress helps promote baso
constriction and induce blood viscosity
so the first step we have to secure all
the equipments and the equipments
are ice chips or small ice ice bag or
ice cap and our cotton flanel or
towel and then next we have to wash our
hands to prevent the transmission of
microor
organisms next we have to secure the cap
if there is any leakage to so to secure
the
leakage we have to unscrew the
cap and then pour a little water inside
on
it and then screw the
cap and then we have to turn the ice bag
upside down to check if there is any
leakage
so if there is no leakage in the ice cap
we have to put the water
back and then put small ice or ice chips
inside on
it about 2 to three
full I mean two two 2/3
full
and
then after we put the ice in the ice cap
we have to expel the air inside of the
ice bag so we have to lay it on the flat
surface after laying it on a flat
surface we have to screw the
cap so after putting the ice in the ice
bag we have to cover the ice bag with a
cotton flanel or a
towel so we have to put it in an
envelope style like
this so the cotton flanel or the towel
serves as our
insulator so there it goes so after
putting the cotton flanel in the ice bag
apply it to the specified area for about
1/2 hour to 1 hour
and then after an hour remove it before
reapplying
it after applying the cold compress on
the specified area examine the area and
record the client's response so we have
to examine the area so after cleaning
the equipment we have to wash our hands
to prevent the transmission of
microorganisms and that's it that's the
end of the procedure applying cold
compress so let's proceed to hot
compress compress so hot compressed
increase circulation and helps
distribute the body's healing element to
specific area so first gather the
equipments so the equipments are hot
water bag cotton flanel hot water and
then cloth so next is check the
patient's
skin for any
breakdown and scar tissue and then next
is
hand washing to prevent transmission of
microorganisms so next is check the hot
water bag for any leaks so to check for
leaks pour a small amount of
water and then screw the
cup and then turn the hot water bag
upside down to check for
leaks so if there is no leaks then
discard the
water so next pour the hot water into
the hot water bag for about 1/2 to 2/3
full and be
careful so after pouring the water expel
the air place a hot water bag into on a
flat and then facing the opening upward
and
then screw the cup
tightly and then wipe the
bag again turn the hot water bag upside
down to check again for
leaks next place the hot water bag into
the cotton
flanel do it in an envelope
style and like
this
all right that's it then place it into
the effective
area like this make sure that the
opening of the hot water bag is away
from the patient's skin and then place
it not more than 30 minutes and then
after 5 minutes check for
bruts
then we card
equipments and then next do hand washing
to prevent transmission of
microorganisms all right so that's the
end of our demonstration about cold
compress and hat comence I hope you
learn something from our instructional
video yes and again I will Lia Bello and
I'm
GL thank
you after applying the cold compress in
the specified area examine the
area
and
