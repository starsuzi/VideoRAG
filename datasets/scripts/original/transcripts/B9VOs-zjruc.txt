hey there you guys uh today we are going
to answer or I'm going to answer a uh a
viewer question I was asked how do you
use or what if you have a pot that you
really really like uh a decorative clay
pot or just just a beautiful piece of um
uh maybe even a piece of china a
beautiful bowl or or something that you
have around your house that you'd like
to grow plants in perhaps a teacup
or a really nice coffee mug from a
vacation or something something that
doesn't have a drainage hole and you
don't want to damage it by putting a
drainage hole in it how do you grow a
plant in there successfully well the
answer to your question is uh you kind
of don't
uh you can't just plant a plant directly
in a pot that doesn't have any drainage
unless of course it's a bog type plant
like a
Papyrus um maybe an elephant ear could
get away with it maybe a banana could
get away with it uh just because they
can tolerate lots and lots of moisture
uh but generally plants will not do very
well in a pot without drainage for one
you need good air circulation to roots
for them to really Thrive and for two if
there's no drainage where does the water
go after after you water it
um that is a tricky question you could
put some drainage in the bottom of one
of these pots and then pot it on top uh
pot your plant on top of the gravel but
uh that's only a temporary solution it
it will
eventually uh over time get water logged
because you won't notice that the plant
still has um water still remaining and
you're going to continue to water it I
made that mistake with uh I don't know
if you can see it this big planter over
here last year I do believe it was last
year I kept watering it it had a banana
in it the red banana and uh halfway
through the summer I realized there was
about an inch of water uh in the planter
and I'm like what the heck is this I
thought that the plant was using up all
of the moisture but uh turns out that
over time the water level just kept
rising and rising and rising and uh
actually had to poke a hole in the
bottom of the pot or at the side of the
pot and have the excess water drain out
um it wasn't a nice uh procedure but uh
to get to it there is a way that you can
plant your plants in something like this
use this as a pot cover so what you want
to do is you want to
find um a old plastic pot like you get
from the garden center uh maybe with
your shrubs or something in it uh or
just those plastic 4 in pots whatever
whatever size works best for you um as
you can see this this uh this pot is a
little bit too tall for this container
don't fret just take some
scissors and uh cut it down to the size
that you
need get a little bit crafty with
this you won't see this pot
anyway so you might as well just uh tear
it all
up so now that we've got this cut down
it's just a little pot insert you got
nice drainage holes in the
bottom now it fits right nicely into
this pot so now we're going to make sure
that we have some
drainage just got some decorative Stones
you can use gravel you can use packing
peanuts you just want to lift the pot
up uh an inch or so so that uh it your
plant doesn't sit in water there's a
place for the the moisture to
go and uh after you water your plant
it's always a good idea to uh to double
check how much moisture is left in the
bottom cuz uh you don't want your plant
sitting in
water these scissors are
horrible anyway here we
go as you can see I've got this in a in
a in a pot with no drainage as well um
but I just have it in a 4in pot sticking
right in there you don't even know it's
in a pot that's the best way to go about
it and after I water it I dump out the
uh the excess moisture pop it back in
and we're good to
go just need to try to cut this off a
little bit
more there we go just how to get it
started these pots get more flimsy when
you cut the the top
off that's all
right okay now it's nice in
there so I also had this uh lovely
hanging pot I don't want to uh to put
any drainage holes in this because if
I'm going to grow something inside I
don't want it to leak all over the place
so I'm going to do the same method I'm
just going to put some some stones in
the bottom and then I'll put uh my plant
in there so that it's just up near the
top and uh if there's some space around
the pot I'll just
um where do I got it
here why not dress it up with some uh
with some decorative Moss some SP
Spanish moss works really really nice uh
it also keep some moisture
in so let's get back to this
one just want to remove the soil or the
pot the old pot from the root system
this is an asparagus Fern by the way
absolutely love asparagus fern this
one's called a Ming asparagus fern and
look at the roots on this absolutely
incredible it need to get repotted
months ago but I just uh I haven't
gotten around to it these aren't even uh
ferns at all they're in the asparagus
family uh they produce little white
flowers and they have red berries uh
really really
cool and so I need some
soil so we got the the stones in the
bottom for
drainage GNA put my soil in the bottom
and I'm just going to plant the plant in
there like like I normally
would move this
aside poke pot this uh plant up here let
me just move the camera down a little
bit so you can see what's
happening there we
go so we got the plant in here just
plant it like it's in a normal
poot throw some soil in around the
roots I'm not scarifying this plant's
Roots probably should but uh these are
really really tough plants it'll find
its way and start
growing prolifically in a few
days once they find more space they take
over very
quickly these plants uh the the Ming
aelia or the sorry Ming aelia the Ming
asparagus fern or asparagus ferns in
general have uh really thick root
systems for water storage so they
tolerate u a drought condition really
really
[Music]
well so you want to follow the same
planting rules you want to leave a
little bit of
space
um from the top of the pot half an inch
or so so that when you water it doesn't
uh spill over the
edge want to firm the soil in just
normal just created a pot just to
uh Place into
this so then all you need to do is plunk
it down in
there and if your stones are arranged
correctly it will sit
flat and there you go that's how I would
uh plant your plants inside a uh inside
a pot that doesn't have any drainage and
uh if you do water too much just pop
your plant out dump out the extra water
and you're good to go again you need to
make sure that you can take your plant
out uh otherwise you probably will lose
it over time um to to rot and uh just to
uh dress up the pot a little
bit oh this stuff is so messy
just to dress it up a little bit Let's
uh throw some of this decorative
moss in the
planter make it look all
pretty now the new growth will grow up
through there and be super super happy
so anyway I hope this helped you out uh
in answering your question uh
unfortunately you can't just plant
things in the pot at self uh otherwise
it probably won't survive it might last
a year or two but uh really they need uh
good air circulation and they also need
drainage uh with some exceptions and uh
again if you can't find a pot that fits
in perfectly uh make your own um there's
some larger pots out there that you can
cut down in half just just make it fit
or you can use a few smaller pots um you
could maybe do three 3-in pots in this
and squish them down in and and have
three different plants growing out of
this planter and each plant has its
individual pot be creative with it and
have fun and uh make it your own anyway
happy growing everyone
