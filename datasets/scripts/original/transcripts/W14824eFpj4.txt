hi guys Christy here with Kate Couture
and today I am sharing our
minion cake
project
so our minion cake with a minion cake
topper
and they're matching cupcakes are all
made out of or decorated in fondant with
uh our Toppers we like to mix our
fondant with a good amount of gum
tragicanth in order to get the firmness
to really come in and allow us to uh
have a stable topper
with the fondant we use is cake Couture
fondant it is our
special formula of and it's somewhat of
a marshmallow fondant so that's probably
the closest thing to it we have created
a pretty unique recipe that makes this
fondant really easy to work with super
smooth
um
very elastic and you can see no elephant
skin it makes it so um
so easy to get rid of air bubbles if you
get any
and it's just we love this fondant so
much
um and we started marketing it and we
currently have it available on Etsy
um and it's perfect for molds
um covering cakes making fondant figures
anyway that's our project thanks for
