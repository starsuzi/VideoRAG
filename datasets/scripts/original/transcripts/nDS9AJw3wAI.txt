STACEY: AS STEVE KARLIN SHOWS
US, SOME OTHERS LIKE THEIR
LEMONADE THE NEW WAY, SMASHED.
STACEY: JOHN --STEVE:
JOHN IS
OLD SCHOOL.
OUR LEMONADE HAS BEEN MADE
FOR THE SAME WAY SINCE 1947.
STEVE: JOHN'S DAD DREAMED UP THE
RECIPE 60 YEARS AGO.
IT STARTS WITH SQUEEZING.
HE ALSO MASTERED THE METHOD OF
USING A REAL GLASS AND FILTERED
WATER.
WE USE THE SAME AMOUNT, EVERY
TIME, OF SUGAR.
STEVE: A SIMPLE SYSTEM THAT ENDS
WITH A NOT-SO-SUBTLE, SHAKE,
SHAKE, SHAKE.
WE CAN MONITOR ALL THE JEWS
GOING INTO THIS LEMONADE.
STEVE: JOHN LIKES TO SHAKE UP
HIS LEMONADE BUT ANOTHER
LONGTIME FAIR GUY LIKES TO SMASH
IT.
STAN KRANOVICH'S DAD OPENED UP
THE SKIER AND STEIN IN
1964.
I WAS TRAINED AS AN AVIATION
MECHANIC, SO I'VE GOT A LITTLE
KNOWLEDGE OF WORKING WITH METALS
AND WELDING.
STEVE: SO
STAN, AN UNUSUAL MAN,
USED HIS MECHANICAL MIND.
AND HE CAME UP WITH THIS
INCREDIBLE AIR POWERED
CONTRAPTION.
WE SMASH IT 8 TO 12
TIMES.
SHAKEN UP, PUT SUGAR IN IT.
STEVE: SO WHICH IS BETTER,
SQUEEZED OR SMASHED?
THE MEN BEHIND BOTH LEMONADE'S
SAYING, BUT THEY DO AGREE ON
THIS.
MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
FUN.
YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE FUN.
