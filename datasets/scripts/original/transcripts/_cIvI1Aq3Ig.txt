on today's segment I'm going to show you
how to make it PJ pant pattern I'm going
to go over a few things before I delve
into the segments the PJ pant pattern is
letter size I took care of all the
measurements for you just figure out
your size great news the seam allowance
has also been configured into the
pattern so you don't have to worry about
adding that on after you finish drafting
the chart is link below this video all
you have to do is follow along so you
know how to draft pants you don't know
how to sell them that is a problem but
no worries because I've linked that
below the video as well if it's not up
yet it will be in a week draw a straight
line to represent the length of the pant
come down one inch from the top edge
draft a straight line and this will
represent the waist find the waist to
hip depth on your chart and place a
notch
from that notch you will extend the line
out and this will represent the hip line
find the waist to crotch step place a
knotch
and then extend the line out and that
will represent the crotch line
the knotch that I just circled is very
important because you will extend
another line out and that's going to be
considered the crotch extension
find the hip to knee length place a
notch extend another line out and this
will represent the knee measurement
find the length of the knee to ankle
measurement or the hem place a knotch
and extend the line up and that will
represent the hem or ankle
and that is the draft of the front pant
block
using a straight-line connect the waist
to the hip from the crotch extension
you're going to extend that 45-degree
crotch line draw a curve to extend all
three points and you can also use a
compass or French curve ruler just to
smooth out the line
using a ruler or an l-shape ruler better
yet a yardstick join the crotch knees
and hem
as mentioned earlier the seam allowance
has been configured into the
measurements so you don't have to worry
about adding that on after finishing
your pattern but what you can do
Oh in 5/8 of an inch from the center
front draft a-line and label its center
front
now to place our notches come down four
inches from the waistline place a notch
and draw a little triangle there
for those of you who are petite such as
myself we're going to place a couple of
more marks and I'll go ahead and show
you how to make the adjustments later go
up one inch from the hip line draft a
straight line and label a petite from
the petite line come down half an inch
and just place a couple of dashes
now label that fold line
from the top edge of the waistline come
down an inch and a quarter and place a
line this represents the fold line which
creates the casing for the waistband
last but not least come down one inch
from that fold line place the mark and
label that waistline
the drafting of the pant back is similar
to that of a pant front the only
differences are the measurements so what
I've already done is created my block
and from here on n I'm just going to go
ahead and join the components of the
pants
the crotch extension and the 45-degree
extension will be a little larger for
the pant back
the pan back will need two notches which
are two triangles
label the pattern pieces add on the
grain lines and you're done if you are
petite please continue to watch and I
will show you how to make the adjustment
to the patterns
if you're petite making adjustments to
your pant pattern is pretty easy fold
the petite line and fold it over the hip
line and tape it's that easy just make
sure that you measure your inseam before
you take that step you may not need to
do this
you'll have a little bit of an excess
you'll just clean it up and make sure
the line is nice and smooth
need to take in a little bit more take
an inch or two away from the hem this
concludes our segment if you have not
