in this video i'm going to show you how
to clean
calcium deposits out of of your dishware
by using distilled white vinegar bought
it at walmart
a simple sponge this is a new style
sponge i also got at walmart
these are very nice and they don't
keep the moisture in they dry out faster
so you don't have bacteria sticking
around as long
nice new sponge this is a typical
utensil that has calcium deposits you
can see how
very white and cloudy it is this is from
using hard water
most water in america is hard water
some homes have soft water if you get
soft water
and you have dishes like this starting
out once you clean this
it typically will not come back if you
have the soft water in the home
i also have a lid from one of our pots
that i found from a neighbor that has
the calcium deposits on it as well
okay so i've got some water here
to rinse off with and i've got a hair
dryer what we're going to do
is dry the utensils at the end to show
that
it does stay clean and it's not just
cleaner looking
from being wet okay
so we're going to take some of the
vinegar
got our nice neat new sponge
now when i did this for an example
yesterday
i let it set for five to ten minutes
i don't think it's always necessary
certainly depends
on the degree of how long
the utensils have been exposed to the
calcium
so let that sit there for a moment while
i'm cleaning the lid
i also did this as an example yesterday
with
all lemon juice i just took a lemon i
bought from the produce section of the
grocery store
cut it open and i actually used the half
of the lemon
as a sponge itself and i used that to
clean some of my utensils
and it worked very well
and then i thought that might be a
little difficult for some people
uh to get their hands on that and they
may not want to deal with that
raw onion or excuse me raw lemon
but the distilled vinegar is certainly
easy to
to get and it's very affordable
i think i spent a dollar and a half for
that
half gallon of white distilled vinegar
and right above in the camera view
there is the uh red tub
that has just some plain white clean
water
that i'm going to rinse this off with
okay
so i can tell already this is looking
very nice i'm going to let that set
there
set this aside i'm going to rinse
my measuring cup
all right that's one's rinsed off it's
off my lid
dry these both off with
now i can see not all the calcium came
off of this utensil
the utensils i cleaned yesterday for my
own
preparation came out very nice
so let's speed up this drying process
with a hair dryer
you can see the calcium spots are coming
back on the bottom
the inside of the cup actually looks
pretty good the outside
starting to turn white again
my pan lid is looking pretty good it's
not as clean underneath here where i
couldn't reach very well
that sponge is a coarse sponge you might
be able to get in there with maybe a
toothbrush
something that can get into a tighter
angle a little better
now i do see i have something down here
on this lid i don't know what this
is it doesn't look like housing deposits
it sits like a stain of something else
but it certainly appears that the
calcium deposits
have come off and it looks rather nice
granted this lid is been around for a
while
and is scratched up from other things
but the calcium has certainly come off
i'm going to work on this lid a little
bit more i'm sorry the measuring cup
not sure if you can hear me while that
fan was on but the measuring cup
the outside didn't come near as clean as
the inside the inside looks very good
and the lid looks pretty good uh there
are a lot of scratches on here from
where
and there is something on here i'm not
sure what this is
i don't believe that that is calcium
positive it looks like a stain of some
other type
so i don't know how to get that off but
the calcium portion did come off
okay i'm going to try a little bit more
on this
if i wasn't doing the video i just let
it set for a while
and if i was fancy enough i'd know how
to stop and start the camera again and
spice it together but if i can do this
in one run
i think that would be convenient for me
all right i'm going to rinse that off
and see how we did
so
all right bring back our hair dryer see
how we did this time
inside still looks great nice and dark
black
the outside is much better
so it's probably a good idea to let that
vinegar
set on there for five to ten minutes i
rushed it
and so a second uh attempt certainly got
the rest of the calcium off
so it is looking very nice
and certainly
not embarrassing as it was
so that certainly looks much nicer than
it did uh
not as embarrassing um
so i think that uh should help you with
cleaning the calcium deposits off of
your utensils with distilled white
vinegar thanks for watching
