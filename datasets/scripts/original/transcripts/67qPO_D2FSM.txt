hey everybody welcome back in this
edition of pretty things Rock I'm going
to show you how I shave my um my chalk
or that is how I make my chalk into
powder I use this little um grater that
I got from the dollar store for by Betty
Crocker it has its own little
compartment here where all the powder
will fall
into and it's really really simple I
know there's probably like half a
million of these videos out there
but there there's always that chance
there'll be one or two people that have
not seen a video but happen to see mine
so there you
go and I'm going to be using this
sidewalk chalk
whoops the sidewalk chalk that I got at
um Dollar Tree for a buck which was
really cool and let's get started I'm
going to open up my packet it come in at
pack of five and let me find my scissors
and we'll start with the
blue there we go so you just simply do
like you do with cheese and you grate it
you can hold it like this or like this
let me pan out a little bit there you go
hold it like this or just hold it down I
probably would prefer to hold it down in
case this pops open or not and I will
start with this
side and it's really really easy you can
see how it's already cutting it or
grating
it so I just do that and it just falls
falls into the
bottom let's get
[Music]
that now you see why I put a piece of
paper towel there in case it doesn't
fall
through okay
and tap it with this and you can
see you can see the chalk in there
already
grated very
powdery my hands it will get dirty a
little bit but there I did spill a
little bit right here from The Edge but
that's
okay you just be a little more careful
while you do it and someone tend to stay
on top like you just
noticed see I haven't used this
particular grer yet brand new so I could
be
why I bought a couple of
these at um Dollar
Tree so you can see already there's
powder there so I'm just going to open
it up and then tap
it tap it so it goes
in
like that let it all fall in
there like that but it's really it's
graded and there you go and then from
here all you do is um put it in a baggie
and you're done so I'm going to finish
grating this and um we'll see how much I
get out of this and then I'll come back
to you with the complete finished chalk
which is only going to be one that I'm
going to use and then we'll put it in a
baggie and see how that looks see how
much comes out all right I'll be back
soon okay so I'm back this is the whole
chalk all graded
down and I'm going to put some of it in
this baggie I don't have any baggies
bigger than this so this is what it's
going to have to do I'm going to try not
to spill it so we'll just pour it in
there
slowly
go
chalk is
very clumpy it can
Clump so it's best just to fill a little
bit at a
time so it doesn't get all clumped up on
you and
um and
start spilling over or not going all the
way through like
that probably would have been easier
with the spoon but I thought this would
might be
easier come
on we
go we could still feel a little bit more
in
here oh it's not going to go through
unless I hit it hard it'll go
through pour too much in
there do a little bit at a
time
this little bit
more
okay there you go this is
a I think this is a
2x3
um not envelope baggie sorry trying to
get some of that air out of
there but as you can see it's nicely
powdered and I still have more in here
so I probably can put possibly the rest
of this in another baggie like I said I
don't have any bigger baggies otherwise
I would have put it all into one baggie
I might just hold out until I get bigger
baggies to finish doing the rest of the
Crayons I mean chalks oh my God I'm all
messed up today but there you go that's
the chalk very easy to do like I said
before it was a Betty Crocker grater for
a dollar at um Dollar
Tree and I'll be giving one of these
away in my um upcoming contest so be
looking out for
that and that's it that's how to grate
chalk and I used one of them one
whole stem of
chalk made all this chalk
here so that's really cool anyway I hope
this is helpful to you
and thank you for watching and I will
see you guys next time
bye-bye
