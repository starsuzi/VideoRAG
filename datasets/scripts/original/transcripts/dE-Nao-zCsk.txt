hi everyone welcome to foodie summer i am summer now I am in Den Haag the
Netherlands today is Sunday and I'm
going to make some hot pot at home so
you might wonder if its difficult to prepare
or what should I do for hot pot so in
this video I'm going to teach you guys
how to make simple Chinese hot pot at
home if you live in the Netherlands
first we need to get some ingredients
for your hot pot one good thing about hot pot
is that you can throw almost whatever
you want in the soup base and it won't
go wrong so just go to a nearby
supermarket grab some raw meat seafood
and vegetables if you want something
really special like beef or fish ball or
sliced lamb or beef you can go to an
Asian market called oriental you can
find the market in many big cities in
the Netherlands there you can find a lot
of Asian ingredients
one more thing
don't forget to buy hot pot soup base
you can find it at Asian shop or you can
simply use any homemade chicken soup or
beef soup as the broth
then you should just take out a rice
cooker or any cooking pan you prefer but
just to make sure this one is really deep
so that after your boiled soup it won't
overflow or something then just open
your hot pot soup base package my
content separate small packages first
one is some powder
put them in your cooking pan
and then I also got some dry chili
pieces
oh that's a lot actually
if you cannot eat chili don't put all
of the them in also there are some black
beans just add it in if you like
I also got some chili oil
and then add a certain amount of water
stir it around then time to boil it
wait till the soup is boiling you can put
any kind of ingredients you prefer in the
soup and then you just need to be
patient wait for the soup to boil again
and now you can enjoy your meat
meanwhile cook the ingredients for
second round
so today we've got golden mushroom and
some deep-fried tofu puffs also got
sliced lamb pieces and some fish
balls this one is normal white fish ball
and this one is the cuttlefish ball also
we have some shrimp dumpling here and
this one is the fish ball also but with
some mixed seafood inside as the
filling it smells so good now we just
finished cooking the sliced and lamb
pieces we got this one frozen from the
Asian market and then this one doesn't
need to cook long like when the hot pot
is boiled we'll just throw it in and
then cook for 10 to 20 seconds then they
are ready to eat
lets try it
I love the lamb flavor it is so special
is different from any other meat and
today I got the soup base it's also
lamb broth so it makes the lamb even more
flavourful you can always throw the
lamp in first to get some extra favor
for the soup then later if you put any
vegetables or other other fish balls to
the hot pot they were also
taste like meat so that's one tip for hot
pot this one is a little bit saltyish
but i think it is because I put a little bit
too less water in the hot pot so maybe
if you cook at home
you put slightly a bit more water than
what I did before so it won't get too
salty in the beginning
even though the soup base is sad a spicy
but actually it's not spicy at all in my
opinion it just gives a little bit
stronger meat favor - the lamb it's really
nice
this was pooping just now did you see that I took a bite and then come out from the
other side
Oh hot
so this one is the fishbowl with mixed
seafood filling but actually I have
no idea what's in it it does taste like
a lot of things mixed together but what
exactly it is I don't know but it's nice
though the inside is really soft is a
little bit like what wateryish but it's
really seafoodie
what's it called seafood seafoodie it's
really really soft after bowling it
looks kind of hard but after bowling is
really tender soft you can easily put
your chopsticks in OOP oops
and I want to show you something it's
really bad now this is the shrimp
dumpling look at this is just like the
rubber outside it looks so bad I didn't
expect it would become like this it was
supposed to be like transparent color
and really cute really
oh nice taste but I have no idea that I
even eat it or not it still tastes nice
I still want to recommend you to get
this one even though I know it doesn't
look so good but shrimp dumplings
is always shrimp dumpling always my
favorite
look at the shrimp inside such a huge
piece it's more like smashed shrimp I've
no idea anyway I like it
let's try the
fried tofu its called fried tofu puff so it's
deep fried and inside I don't know if
you can say they have a lot of tiny
bubbles and all those bubbles with air
they will grab all the juicy of the
favor from the soup base in the hot pot
which make the tofu really tasty so now
it doesn't taste like tofu all anymore it's
more like a meaty flavor
tofu is one of the highly recommended
ingredients you should get for the hot
hot especially the deep-fried ones I
still want to try this ball
it's the cuttlefish balI
i think it will
taste the same as all the other fish
balls normal fish balls it all tastes
like the hot pots base at this point
because we already boiled it for quite a
long time all the soup is already
sinking into the ball so this one is
really taste like a Jenny
it's really cute so now tender a little
bit chewy can see the inside here
and if you chew carefully you can still
feel there's a little tiny piece of
cuttlefish inside it gives a little bit
more rich texture
I'd say the cuttlefish ball is more no
we already finished but I would say that
cuttlefish ball here is more tasty more
flavorful than the normal fish ball
because you can really taste the small
pieces of the cuttlefish so I would say
if you only want to try one fish bowl
then cuttlefish ball
this mushroom here is called enoki it is
from a Japanese name which is enokidake
but hearing nothing we just caught it
like golden mushroom or got a niddel
mushroom whatever as a Chinese we always
say it is called see you tomorrow
because this one is a little bit
difficult to digest after you eat it so
the next morning when you go to toilet you might still see the shape of the
mushroom that's why it's called see you
tomorrow lets try see you tomorrow
hmm it doesn't taste like mushroom at
all it is at the meat sink is because I
I cook it for like five minutes in the hot
pot so now it's just taste like the lamb
soup that's why they says this kind of
mushroom is really good ingredients for
the hot spots because it will grab all
the favor from hotpot so it doesn't have
a strong flavor itself like some
mushrooms you can really taste mushroom
flavor but this one it will grab all the
favours from the soup from the meat from
other vegetables other ingredients and
then it just tastes like Every
everything
very nice
sometimes a bit spicy
what about this one
not super spicy
so you think Dutch people will like this kind of hot pot soup bsae
