all right so today we're going to be
doing a fuzzy navl as my uh first video
series uh a lot of bars make them really
weak and I'm going to show you how to
make a good tasting
one I uh started by cutting a slice of
orange
here as you can
see and I got some cherries cocktail
cherries so what we need to do is get
the
[Music]
alcohol so what we need
is new bottle of
vodka and we
[Music]
need orange
juice and you need Peach
[Music]
schnaps those are the three mixes you
need uh I do ice cubes I make my own I
have an ice maker but they're gross so I
use purified water to make my own for
drinks
[Music]
all
[Music]
right okay so I got interrupted there
and uh I don't edit my videos ever so
it's probably going to be some glitch in
there right right in the last couple
seconds but anyways here's what I cook I
make these
in those are my home high ball glasses
High ballish glasses I
guess and
and for a fuzzy naval I usually want to
go about three to four ice cubes in the
glass
so let's see if I
can do
that and that's good good quality uh
well that I know of bottled
water and I'm going to go with four ice
cubes in that
[Music]
so the next thing I need to do is get my
shaker out and I like doing about so I
don't water down the alcohol while it's
shaking I like to go about two ice cubes
in
that put that back in the freezer
[Music]
[Music]
all right so what we're going to do
is usually I use like just a regular
[ __ ]
uh but since I'm on video and I don't
have really a free hand I'm going to
just use this mixing
glass
and what we're going to do
is most recipes if they call a vodka at
all they call for 1 o and that's just
not enough for a big drink like this in
my
opinion so I pour 2
oz 2 oz of
[Music]
vodka and then I do my
uh my peach
schnaps and I go 1 oz of
that for FL
flavor and then 5 oz of orange juice so
we're at 3 oz alcohol so we'll go up to
8 oz with the orange
juice all right so that's basically our
drink we just need to shake it and we're
[Music]
good there we are I'm going to set this
down so I can
[Music]
uh I can do it with one
hand not necessarily left-handed but
we'll figure it out all right
left-handed uh going to shake
that usually go between about 5 to 10
seconds uh in a metal Shaker that pulls
it down plenty for me with the ice
already in there all right now before I
pour it what I'm going to do is I'm
going to throw a cocktail Cherry
in
yeah now you can use these uh
party Forks or
whatever and grab one and then eat it
later so that usually works out pretty
[Music]
good and then
um we're going to go ahead and pour our
drink so there it is
prepped pour it in
we'll take our orange slice nice big
orange slice that we did cut
earlier shove that down in
there CH to kind of shake it up a little
and there we go fuzzy navl
