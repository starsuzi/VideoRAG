so
so
so we're going to make some cultured
buttermilk not the
buttermilk you see on some of the videos
is made of the combination of lemon
juice and cream
this is cultured by using a selection of
bacteria
to produce the finished result and
therefore you don't need cream which can
be quite expensive you can just use only
milk
so let's have a look at the sort of
things we'll need in order to produce
the buttermilk
you'll need a measuring jerk and this
measures up to two liters you want some
wide neck flasks
uh there's one there and a different one
there
this is probably the better one but i've
got an additional one just in case
there's more liquid that was required or
an overflow from this flat so there's
the flasks
you will need a digital thermometer
and it's on my website so i'll give you
some links how to
pick up one of these quite reasonably it
measures in degrees centigrade
or celsius and you can press a button
it changes to degrees fahrenheit so you
will need one of those to check the
temperature of the milk
you will need a whisk to whisk the
buttermilk with the milk
you will need the buttermilk now
this is by a company called dale farm in
the uk
and usa there are various manufacturers
this
is a cultured buttermilk it's not real
buttermilk in as much as
real buttermilk is made as a byproduct
from making butter
when cream is churned you get a better
fats
plus you get the buttermilk but this is
cultured buttermilk so you need some
cultured buttermilk then you need the
milk
this one in the uk has got a blue top
tells me
it's full fat which is four percent you
can use semi skimmed
which is two percent or you can
use fully skimmed which is zero percent
fat
uh my favorite tends to be the channel
islands milk which is about five percent
fat
gives a nice creamy consistency but
organic milk is fine even if it's skim
you still get a good consistency
you could also use goat's milk as well
in order to make cultured buttermilk
gives you a different taste
but again quite a nice product
the first part of the process in making
cultured buttermilk
is to tip the milk into a saucepan and
to turn the heat on because we need to
heat the milk
to about 82 degrees celsius that's
roughly about 180 degrees fahrenheit
this is to kill any external pathogens
and bacteria that we don't want
in the finished result so let's just
turn that on
what i'm going to do i'm going to turn
the heat down
so it's just slightly heating but keep
an eye on it we don't want it too
far above 82 or 180
because that will develop almost like a
boiled flavor
so just to check on the temperature at
the moment
it's showing me 15 degrees celsius
or about 60 degrees fahrenheit
so i'm going to keep an eye on that and
as soon as it hits
80 degrees celsius or about
180 degrees fahrenheit then we'll do the
next stage in the process
so the temperature on there now is show
me
83 degrees celsius color 24
85 now that's high enough temperature so
i'm going to turn off the heat
so i pull the heated milk into my jug
and you want to check it now
it's still looking about 77 degrees c
now the temperature i wanted to get to
before i add the
cultured buttermilk is
42 degrees celsius anywhere between
37 or 42 degrees celsius so it's going
to take me a little bit of while
to actually cool down so i guess that
temperature before i can add
cultured buttermilk
so i've covered down now with cling film
or cling wrap i don't anything to
get in there while it's cooling down
so we'll just leave that now for perhaps
an hour hour and a half
but i would come back every sort of half
hour to check the temperature
because we are looking between again
working in celsius between
37 which is body temperature and 42
degrees celsius the nearer to 42 degrees
celsius the better
okay so it's been about an hour a whole
and a half so let's just
check the temperature
we're on 42.9
43 degrees celsius so we're almost there
we need to get a round over 42
so the next stage in the process while
i'm waiting for that to cool down
to 42 i'm going to boil a cattle
because i need to disinfect and get the
temperature of my flasks
nice and warm
so the reason i want to pour boiling
water
in a flask so be careful when you do
this obviously you can have the safety
reasons
is firstly to preheat the flask
to get it nice and warm because we want
to keep it at a
constant warm temperature as we leave
the product
throughout the night it also
disinfects the inside of the flask
killing any undesirable fungi
any possible pathogens another bacteria
which we don't really
want in the finished product
so there's no need to leave it for too
long just a couple of minutes
and then we'll add the solution
what i also like to do just to be on the
safe side
is to dip your whisk
into the flask to make sure that's
disinfected as well
and readiness for the mixing so you put
that to one side
it'd probably be a good idea as well
what i always do is to tip boiling water
on
onto the stoppers as well that go onto
the flasks
so in order to make the buttermilk i'm
going to
i give my buttermilk a bit of a shake up
now there's quite a mountain here
already but i don't need to add all that
i'll just do a final check the
temperature
see where we are
around 40 40.6
40 degrees celsius almost perfect
okay i like to get 42 but just under 42
as i said earlier
between 37 and 42 is great
so let's just turn that off now
i'll show you the amount that you need
to add
we're just going to add just a small
amount
you see how much 15 over there and that
will be plenty
so we need to do then is just just got
in
that's well whisked through and now we
just took that into the flasks
so i've added to both flasks uh this one
in particular i filled up
and as you can see i'll just get a
little shake it is quite liquidy
now once i put the lid on that leave
that overnight you will see
a remarkable change now the rest i put
into the
spare thermos flask which i've already
sealed
so that will go to one side again i will
leave that overnight
so i just want to seal that
my lid and just leave that down
overnight make sure it's totally sealed
up
so let's have a look at the results
this has been left overnight
um oh look at that set that's what i
call the magic moment
this is where the culture the bacteria
have done their work they worked on the
mark
and they turned it into buttermilk
