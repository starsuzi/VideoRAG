- Hi friends, it's April.
Thank you so much for tuning in.
Today, we're gonna make
the Glowing Green Smoothie,
which can be found in The
Beauty Detox Solution book.
My friend Crystal recommended it.
She has perfect skin, so
I have to know her secret.
And she actually is on day 80-something
of The Beauty Detox Solution
and the Glowing Green Smoothies
and her skin is perfect.
She looks like she's glowing from within
and I wanna look like her.
I wanna look like that.
And so, I'm starting
and this is my day two.
I hope you try it and continue
on this process with me.
And the reason as to why
a Glowing Green Smoothie
is so beneficial for you
is because it's nutritious,
it has all these greens,
it has fruits and vegetables,
it releases the toxins from your body
because of the fiber it has.
It will end up making your
skin glow from within,
your nails will be stronger,
hair will be shinier,
you'll have more energy and
it will aid in weight loss,
due to the high fiber in
the Glowing Green Smoothie.
I hope you have it for breakfast
every single day with me.
So, let's go ahead and make
the Glowing Green Smoothie.
So, first of all, you're going
to want to cut half a lemon
and put it aside and cut
it into smaller pieces
for the lemon juice.
And then, you're going
to chop some apples.
As long as it's organic,
it doesn't matter what kind of apple.
Just one apple will do.
Chop one pear.
Make sure it's washed and organic as well.
Then, chop a stalk of celery.
Place your apples, pears
and celery into a bowl
and we'll be using this later.
Let's start by adding
one-and-a-half cups of water,
a head of organic romaine lettuce,
and you can just use your
hands to cut the lettuce.
Then, you're going to
add some organic spinach.
I usually like to just add two handfuls.
Once you've added the spinach,
turn the blender on to low and blend.
(blender churning)
Next, add your celery,
your peaches and apples.
And blend.
(blender churning)
Then, add a banana.
And blend.
(blender churning)
Add some parsley...
and then add some cilantro as well.
And squeeze the lemon juice,
half a lemon, into the smoothie.
And blend again.
(blender churning)
So, if you're just
starting out with detoxing
and this is your first time
with the Glowing Green Smoothie,
you should start out with 16 ounces.
And I like to measure.
So, you'd wanna start out with this much,
which is pretty much this cup.
And because you have extra,
you can actually store it in a container
and put it in the refrigerator
and have that for breakfast the next day.
If you're on the go, you can place it
in a sippy cup container and drink it
while you're on your way to work.
This is really gonna help you.
I thank you so much for
watching and have a great day.
Bye.
