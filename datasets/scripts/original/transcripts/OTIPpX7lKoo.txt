hi YouTubers thanks for tuning in for my
edition of blackened catfish to start
off you're going to need some black
pepper some salt some Caya and pepper
some Sasson Goya Italian seasoning onion
powder and garlic you're going to want
to melt some butter about 1
tbspoon and allow that to
soak as you can see I only have a very
little oil in here
like just enough to barely keep it
coated because it's in the butter
remember so I like to start with my
saass
Goya add my parsley at the beginning so
I'm going to add it now um I do put
parsley on it just a little
bit salt so as you can see I literally
just dashed a little salt and I'm going
to sprinkle
it I don't like a lot of salt
now while that's on there this is
something that I like to do that most
people probably don't this is when I
season the back of
it because I want those ingredients to
be fresh
see that that's going to be so delicious
when it's
done look at
that
yummy bone appetit
