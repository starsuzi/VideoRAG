as i was doing some research into wind
chime designs i discovered the most
incredible website called an engineering
approach to wind chimes by lee height
and i'll put a link to it in the
description i highly suggest you take a
look at this website if you're going to
make some wind chimes because lee has
done everything all of the research for
you everything you'll need to know to
build a wind chime is on that website
and he has the science behind wind
chimes as well as the practical stuff on
how to build wind chimes and what works
best the
types of materials to use different
kinds of tone resonance and
everything and it's filled with
full-size templates that you can print
out and use to cut out all of your
pieces so it's a great body of work
definitely check it out if you're going
to be making some wind chimes there's a
lot of different types of metal you can
use for chimes you could use copper or
brass which would be outrageously
expensive so i decided to go with steel
electrical conduit so this 10 foot
section here cost me about eight and a
half dollars and it still sounds good
and i'm going to start with the conduit
by cutting it up into five pieces to
give me the five tones and on that wind
chimes website there's all sorts of
charts that you can print out depending
on what type of material you're going to
use in my case of course the steel pipe
and i'm using one inch diameter pipe so
there's a chart for that that tells me
exactly the lengths that i need to cut
the pieces to
to obtain a desired tone so my longest
piece is going to be a little over 29
inches long and that will give me an e
so i've got four other notes give me an
entire chord that i hope will sound
pretty nice
so there are my five pipes now this
chart also tells me exactly where the
optimum hang point is so in the case of
this longest piece here i want to drill
my hole at 6 and 9 16 of an inch
these eyelets are what's going to hold
the chimes
on this side the holes that i drilled
are for the chains that's going to hang
it to the ceiling but i'm not gonna put
all these in just yet because i want to
finish it all first
i didn't drill that hole in the top
because apparently these grab the air a
lot better if they're slightly angled so
with the hole in the side i've just put
a knot in the string and it'll hang at
an angle
i've spray painted all of these pipes
silver to cover up all of the conduit
markings and just make them look a
little bit nicer what i'm doing now is
hanging some nylon cord in them it's a
little bit tricky getting it in there
but first i'm starting out with a pretty
long piece of this cord and i'm just
going to make a slipknot in it
so then i can take that loop and i'm
just going to stick it to a dowel here
and fish it down
into the pipe and i've got some steel
wire that i'm going to try to catch that
loop with
and
send it through the other side
all right so now this wire is going
through my pipe and my slip knot i can
just tighten it up like that
now i'm going to just tug on a little
bit and
press this wire in slightly what i'm
trying to do here
is inside of here i want this this wire
to have kind of a v shape so that the
wire will hang straight and won't slide
back and forth on it so
that's pretty good right there
now i'm going to
wrap that wire and just create a loop on
the outside just to prevent it from
sliding back inside of the hole
i'll do one on that side and one on this
side
i've got some chain that i'm going to
use to
hang this from the
i'm ceiling start with the longest pipe
and cinch it up pretty close to the top
and i'm trying to tie these so that
they're all basically even on the bottom
here's the system i'm going to use for
this striker is i'm going to put an
eyelet through there
and then
a washer i'm going to use a coupling
here
so that i can hook another eyelet on
this side the reason why i want to do
this is because
i want this
this whole system to go back and forth
without flopping around and i think if i
just hung it from a string
it would likely do that all right now i
could tie in this striker and the only
thing to know about the striker is that
it needs to be either on the lower third
or the top third to get the best sound
you don't want it in the middle and now
i can tie on the windsail
