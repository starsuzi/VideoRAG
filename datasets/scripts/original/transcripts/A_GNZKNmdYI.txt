hey
blake here the drink chef and your
personal bartender
and today i'd like to make for you a
fuzzy navel
and a fuzzy navel is usually served in a
bucket glass
and we'll build this drink directly into
the serving glass
and we'll start with one and a half
ounces of peach
schnapps this is a popular cocktail
because it's a little bit lower in
alcohol
but very tasty okay ounce and a half of
peach schnapps
and two ounces
of orange juice that's it
i'll garnish that with an orange wedge
which matches the orange juice and
will serve that is a fuzzy navel
cheers
you
