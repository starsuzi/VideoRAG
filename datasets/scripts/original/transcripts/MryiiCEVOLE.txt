most of the products and tools used in
this video are available on our website
www. bevel edge.com today we'll be
building a laminate countertop with a
bevel edge profile and flush undermount
sync by Karan the laminate we're using
is the golden mascarell pattern from
for's new 180fx product line the Lan and
Edge sinks by Karan that we're using are
the only stainless steel sinks
specifically designed for under mounting
in laminate Lan and sinks are also the
only stainless steel sinks that do not
show a transition ring when installed
under
laminate the first step to building a
laminate countertop is to build the
deck so standard depth for a countertop
is 1 in deeper than the cabinets while
we're cutting with a table saw a
circular saw and straight edge works
just as
well working on the bottom of the deck
screw rips of plywood around the
perimeter
[Music]
the first step to installing the sink is
to Mark the top of the deck
use a jigsaw to cut the marked hole keep
the cut out for use
later screw two temporary braces on the
top of the countertop to support the
sink flip the top over and install the
sink with permanent Braes
races flip the top upright and fill the
void between the sink and Deck with auto
body filler
sand
flush lay the laminate over the
countertop deck clamp and router off the
excess mic using an over route
bit is oversized so that it'll allow the
uh you can oversiz cut the sheet
laminate
[Music]
through the drain hole Mark the inside
of the sink with a
pencil remove the laminate from the
countertop and set
aside apply blue painters tape to the
perimeter of the sink to leave a clean
area for the sink installation epoxy
later roll out contact SMI on both the
laminate and the countertop
deck use the plywood sink cut out from
earlier to keep contact cement out of
the sink area also roll out contact
cement on the countertop
deck allow time for the contact M to dry
remove the tape from around the sink
wipe clean and apply a Pand of painters
tape to the inside rim of the sink this
will help protect the sink from
excessive epoxy squeeze out later
and contact with the rout a bit
bearing mix and apply a small bead of
epoxy around the
sink now we're ready to install the
laminate on the
countertop Place towels or something
similar on the deck spaced every few
inches this will allow you to place and
align the laminate before sticking down
align the laminate to the deck and
remove the dowels starting at the center
and working outward
roll the lamin down for a permanent
Bond drill hole in the center of the
sink area use a router with a flush trim
bit to trim the laminate from the
sinkhole using a router with a flush
trim bit trim off all the excess
laminate around the
countertop using a bevel bit trim
laminate flush tole
[Music]
Sy after the epoxy has cured fire on
Sand the laminate to the sink for a
smooth
transition using a block of wood and
sandpaper sand the edges of the laminate
flush to the deck wipe off all excess
dust top and bottom so that tape will
stick
well now we're ready to install the
bevel Edge trim rough cut the bevel Edge
trim to size to make for easier
handling cut and dry fit the bevel Edge
trim to
size coat the back of the beveled trim
entirely with exterior grade wood glue
the wood glue will create a moisture
resistant bond to the
seam starting at an inside corner
install the trim spring clamps can be
used to support one end when getting
started tape every few inches aligning
The Edge as you go again spring clamps
can be used to help adjust the height up
and down
touch up inside Corners with matching
caul if
necessary after the glue dries remove
the tape and
clamps ends as next to a stove can be
capped with scrap
