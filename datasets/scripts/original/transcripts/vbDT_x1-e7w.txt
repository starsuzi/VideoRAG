you know Frank Ben he two tablespoon of
olive oil
one tablespoon of coconut oil
give it a stir
if you're using a frying pan you can do
the hand movement that I am doing right
now
otherwise you can use a spatula
add
one tablespoon of garam masala
or it's also called five spice
add the bay leaves
using a spatula stir it a little bit
make sure the flame is on low heat
otherwise the spices will burn
next add a tablespoon of
garlic paste if you do not find if you
cannot find garlic paste you can use
garlic powder
which is available in most stores like
Walmart or if you're from UK you can
find it at Tesco Asda Sainsbury's
next add a tablespoon of curry powder
now curry powder is a mix of cube um
turmeric cumin and a few other spices
should find curry powder in any main
grocery stores next add a tablespoon of
salt
even a table salt or
any salt next I added one tablespoon of
onion powder
I don't really like getting onions so I
just use onion powder it tastes and
works the same
now some people like the taste and
texture of real onion so if you're one
of those you can go ahead and cut your
own onion
and add it to the spice mix
next add your soaked lentils I soaked it
for
more than an hour
it's okay if there is little water that
comes with the lentil I'll make sure
that the lentils don't get burned now
use your spatula and give it a nice nice
mix
and start it till the water
mixes with the spice
in the heat needs to be
low to medium low
if it's too high it might get burned at
the bottom
keep stirring until the spices
all mixes with the Dal or the lentils
slowly you will see the orange lentils
become
change color it'll become much lighter
almost like a pale Orange
and when all the lintels become pale
orange that men will be done
so look for the color change you'll
you'll notice that
the bright orange color is becoming pale
and whitish
alright so after doing that for about
five minutes almost all the lentils has
big and pale there might be one or two
left and you can keep stirring until you
see all the lentils as big and pill
and then when that happens and the water
will also dry up
so
it's almost very dry extremely dry right
now so in at this point we'll add four
cups of water
if you have hot water hot water it would
be preferred over cold water
software adding four cups of water we'll
cover it with the lid
and let it simmer on a
low medium Heat
for 30 minutes
out to medium Heat
because when you add a lot of water it's
hard for the food to get burned
so keep it on medium heat for 30 minutes
and then now it's time to add the ghee
so I'll add one tablespoon of ghee and
half cup of chopped coriander
or Birds there
are after adding the process we are
almost done here
give it a very gentle stir with the
spatula
make sure to mix the ghee with the Dal
