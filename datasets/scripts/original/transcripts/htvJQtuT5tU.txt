this is Scott The Fixer guy we have a direct-drive 
washer series 80 this one is made by whirlpool and  
it is not going to spin this is a very common 
problem with this type of machine with many  
front-loading in top-loading washing machines 
their failure to go to spin with this machine  
it could be due to three possible causes one 
is that the drain pump is clogged the machines  
clogged it's not able to get all the water out 
of the spin basket that's the case so yeah we're  
looking in here this one does have some water 
remaining the machine can't get all the water  
out it's just too heavy and the machine will 
have trouble reaching full spin to get a drain  
problem most common problem with this type of 
machine is the lid switch ends up breaking or  
not functioning you should be able to lift the 
lid up and down and hear really loud audible  
click that's a sign that your lid switch most 
likely is working and is functioning properly  
so in this case we probably have a functioning lid 
switch by the way it sounds the other possibility  
is a broken rubber coupling which we'll get 
into here and another repair soon that's a  
result of the machine being loaded too heavily 
so we assume that we have a broken coupling we  
need to take the cabinet off to do that it's 
pretty easy what we'll do first is just remove  
this upper console with a couple of Phillips head 
screws one here in the corner one over in this  
corner and the more modern direct drive units 
those same Phillips head screws are actually  
going to be back here in the corner behind the 
console on both sides both times pretty easy to  
remove it's going to make sure we unplug this 
unit first always safety is our primary concern
got that plug now we're going to use screwdriver 
to take out the screws for the speed we'll be  
using that driver which is a little bit quicker 
so this again is one of the easiest machines to  
work on because whirlpool designed it to be very 
simple and modular everything comes apart a quick  
and easy way these both clip screws come out pull 
those out set those off to the side it's very  
important to keep all the fasteners that you take 
out put them off to the side where you know where  
they are trying to keep a mental note of how they 
came out which ones came out first next thing we  
do on this machine is to pull the console toward 
us slightly and then lift up that releases some  
little dogs ears underneath we can see here's 
one here's one they fit into these holes right  
over here so clever way to put this all together 
looking now at the console lifted we can see the  
backside of the timer which is the brains of the 
operation tells the Machine when when to do its  
different functions this is the motor controls 
the timer here we have the water level sensor  
this tube right here brings the column of air up 
as the water fills into the unit presses it on a  
diaphragm which closes a switch and tells the 
Machine that it's time to go to the agitation  
cycle this is a very important part of the washer 
is its ability to tell the proper water level we  
also have the water temperature switch over here 
very simple parts we also have a schematic built  
in which is really nice for technical people 
to be able to see how the electrical circuit  
works now the next thing we'll do to remove the 
cabinet is we're going to remove the lid switch  
modular connection here by just pulling this 
tab towards you and then you can wiggle it up  
comes right off that was this connection next 
thing you can take a standard head screwdriver  
and remove these ingenious clips that whirlpool 
came up with which helped us to quickly remove  
the cabinet we're just going to push standard 
head screwdriver down in and then use this as  
a lever pull back that clip comes up then you can 
just slip it out of this little slot here put that  
off to the side we have another one over on this 
side put that screwdriver in position I'm going  
to push back clip comes up you got that clip out 
now pretty easy to take off the cabinet at this  
point everything has been disconnected and what 
we'll do is open up the lid and then we're going  
to pull the cabinet toward us at a diagonal once 
you have it up at a diagonal lift the cabinet up  
and out of the way to remove the lift switch once 
we've removed this cabinet from the main chassis  
what we'll do next is remove two Phillips head 
screws that are holding it in position they are  
right here and right here by the way if you ever 
have to get your machine just to work until you  
can get the part you just want to work for a 
while if you press in on this panel to hear it  
click a broken lid switch won't click but pressing 
a little further down often will allow it to go to  
spin just until you can get the popular part the 
reason they have this lid switch is they trying  
to prevent a young person from opening this lid 
during high speed spin and reaching in and trying  
to grab something because the machine is powerful 
enough work really hurt the hand even rip the arm  
off so it's a safety device never good to bypass 
this switch so now we're going to remove these two  
screws which are the ones holding the lips lips 
inflate and a long one we have one over here same  
thing there we go and then the next thing we'll do 
to get better access to the lid switch itself is  
we'll join the cabinet upside here one other piece 
we want to remove here since we've already got the  
Phillips head screws removed from this part of the 
lid switch is we also want to remove this modular  
connection exists here at the top this is done by 
pressing in on the sides we have one here and one  
here that we can press in on we should be able 
to wiggle this out of the sheet metal connector  
I want to get a standard head screwdriver 
to give you a little help so you can see
pushing it on that tab pushing it on the other 
tab and then that allowed us to push it down  
through now we can turn it upside down okay 
here we have our cabinet turned upside down  
we can see this is the modular piece that used 
to fit through this hole here that we pulled out  
and here's the lid switch itself which is now 
pretty much ready to come out we just have to  
remove this little ground strap here with which 
is a that's a 3/8 3/8 inch drive I'm going to  
put our drive on there change to different size 
okay so we're just removing this screw which is  
on that ground strap and that will allow us 
now to remove the lid switch we've got that  
out wires free switch is still connected by a 
little spring clip there that holds a plastic  
tube in place and there's another spring clip 
here at the top it's pretty easy to get those out
you should just snap free under a little bit 
of pressure okay so we have the lid switch  
now removed from the cabinet pull that out 
we have the switch itself here and it has a  
paddle on it and this paddle push down should 
have a clicking sound sometimes what happens  
though is that the seam here on the side 
breaks glue fails and then it won't click  
properly anymore won't allow this machine to go 
to spin so that's happened we just need to put  
in a new lid switch and pretty much the reverse 
of how we took it out three straightforward so  
we are going to put our switch back in this 
one seems to be working well another option  
is to do a continuity test if you have a multi 
tester you just take this modular piece here  
on the lid switch you put one of your leads on 
this one here on the side and the other one on  
the other side nothing little though one on the 
side one on this side and then press down on the  
lid switch and you should see a change in the 
reading on your meter or if you have it set to  
audible you should be able to hear a beep meaning 
the electrons are able to flow through the lid  
switch we've done that with this switch already 
we've been able to determine that it is working  
so you need to put in your new switch or in this 
case this one's functioning we'll put this back in
oK we've got this lid switch back into position 
I'm just going to connect this ground strap just  
putting the bolt back in through the washer 
and then back into the hole tightening that  
down and also we're going to put this modular 
connector back through that hole it is modular  
so it's going to be pretty easy we'll just put 
it in proper side you should be able to kind  
of wiggle it in wiggle it into position until it 
locks there we go so that one's done tighten this  
up put the cabinet back on and we'll be done okay 
we've got our cabinet back in position and hook  
up our modular connection for the lid switch 
which is pretty easy just put it in position  
press till it clicks our clips let's go put one 
line here and push that in top clicks this one  
same thing hooks in behind that in position push 
down until that one clicks okay we got that next  
thing is to put the console back into position 
and to do that to bring this down and we're just  
going to try to line up these low dog ears again 
one over here just two guys put it on the other  
side all right and then we're just going to push 
in so we know that's locked shouldn't we lift up  
console shouldn't be able to lift we know that's 
in we're going to put in our Phillips head screw  
each corner this corner okay and we'll tighten 
those up careful not to go too tight on this  
part because it can break and here's the other 
this one had been broken before we got 50 buddy  
there we go all right we're going to make sure 
this guy go to spin just got to plug it back in
we know we have a healthy lid switch in 
there now powers on set it for spin pull back
you're a draining system working open the 
door should the lid should stop right away  
we can see that it was spinning and if 
you ever want to inspect it you can use  
a screwdriver just to push down on the lid 
switch itself see they're taking it to be  
pretty quick sign of a healthy motor 
public pledge help these fences down  
the water and very important never reach in 
here at this high speed spin very powerful
and we have a fully functioning washer again  
it's just gotten the fix-it guy and 
that's our repair for today thank you
