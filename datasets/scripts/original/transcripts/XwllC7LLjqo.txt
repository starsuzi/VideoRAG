so this is the fence that I just
finished came out really nice now I've
got to build another fence and it's not
going to be a fun one CU it's behind all
all these bushes here but I built that
one I would say 3 years ago and this
homeowner uh has been staining and and
keeping up
with the fence so that it doesn't end up
looking like that one
yeah so it's not going to be
fun today the goal is to remove this old
fence which is about
100t it's about 100 ft
long God it's a long fence
[Music]
this fence looks like it was stained at
one
time but
uh it's not wearing very well
[Music]
[Music]
so it's not going too bad got my first
oh 6 7t section of fence
removed and just going to keep on
going I don't think I'm going to be able
to get all of this in my pickup truck I
was hoping to get it all in there but I
have a feeling I have to break this up
into two days and uh two trips to the
the dump I've got 50 in between the
wheel wells of my truck so I'm trying to
get as much in there as
possible so that puts me at
53 so this picket right here is where
I'm going to make my next cut in order
to get the largest piece in between the
wheel wells
[Music]
now that the truck is filled up above
the wheel wells I can start taking 60-in
panels that'll fit through the tailgate
and we can maximize how much we can take
out of here
[Music]
today see there's a lot of broken post
I've gotten about 40 ft taken out and
this battery is
about half dead you got the little
indicators on there what I don't want to
happen is I don't want them to get
overheated so I'm going to take that one
out even though it's not all the way
dead put this one in I'll let this one
cool for 10 or 15 minutes and and put it
on charge
got lucky I had a uh
Barbed whatever that is coupler and two
stainless steel hose CL hose
clamps so there is a 100t Long 6t Tall
rotten privacy fence all in the bed of
this
truck so we're squatting a little low
and I'm going to show you what happens
when I um air up my
airbags instant lift kit
[Music]
[Music]
all right this place is
nasty I usually wear a mask but I forgot
it at at
home I'm going to start building a fence
today and
one thing I want to point out is I can't
use or the reason why I can't use any
sort of power
augur um getting one down through
here I guess you could do it but it's
probably more trouble than it's
worth getting it in and around all these
bushes isn't going to work out very
well but overall building a fence is
extrem extremely easy the only thing
that takes much
skill and I think it just takes more
patience than anything is to set the
posts in a straight
line so I'm just
following the old fence and you can see
this is where I broke off one of the old
posts and I'm going to set my string
line right on it right there and I'm
only doing a small section at a time
this is probably oh only 35 ft 40
ft and you can see that the old fence
was not straight at all cuz this string
line is set up back there where there
was a post and it's on the complete
opposite side so
we'll we'll get this sucker straightened
out
and
Je all right
well yikes I actually just threw away a
piece of this that I had bought the
other day to do a different
one all
right got to get that fixed
what
[Music]
n
got all of our fence pickets laid out
and the fence rails and posts have been
Stained it's kind of funny one neighbor
decided to stain his side before I put
it up and the other neighbor is going to
stain his after I put it
up so it's kind of odd putting the nicer
side on the inside because usually the
nice side goes on the other
side so here is where I've
started and I only do a certain oh
length of fence pickets at a time CU you
can get a little droop in your your
string so this is about 10t section and
then I'll move the string down um I'll
probably just eyeball it
going through this tree here and then on
the picket that's out here I'll set it
up to go maybe 10 15t down
I've just about got all the pickets
screwed to the fence and it's time to
make a gate the customers requested that
I build the new gate exactly the same as
the old gate was built and they even
want me to use the the old hinges and
gate latch so what I'm going to do is
use this as a template and uh try to
make an exact
replica I got everything cut out now I'm
just going to use these 3in screws right
here and
uh see if I can screw these angles
pieces together something like
this and then go from there see how I
don't think this gate works until all
the pickets are actually
attached
[Music]
for for

I filmed this video about a month ago
and it appears that I lost some video
footage I don't have a final walk
through of what the fence looked like
when it's all done uh you did get to see
me put the gate together um it took me
about 4 days if you have any questions
leave them the comment section below and
give this video a thumbs up
