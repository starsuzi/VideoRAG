I have a rental house and a tenant
didn't clean the toilet for two years so
now I have to deal with this calcium
deposit and I have less than a week to
get it out of there so this is what I
went
through I tried bleach on my calcium
deposits staying in the toilet
and it did make the bleach dark brown
turn very light
brown but it did not remove all of the
stain probably didn't remove any of the
stain just changed its color I don't
recommend
it then I tried poent over a 2-day
period I put in two capsules at a time
probably eight times with no effect
so that one is debunked
one thing I'll say about the POA Dent
was it smelled really good but don't eat
it the next thing I tried was
this acid toilet bowl
cleaner I left it in
overnight
and not really that
successful I would not recommend
it the last thing I tried tried was this
muratic acid swimming pool
acid and I put about a quart maybe a
little more than a court in the toilet
bowl let it sit in there for two 2 and
1/2 hours and voila
success the calcium deposits were
floating on the top of the water the
bowl was clean
the only thing uh is it's a bit
dangerous you don't want to get it on
yourself you'll get burned don't want to
spill it on your carpet or floor it'll
leave a it'll eat
it and uh if you leave it laying around
in the garage anything close by will
start to
rust so yes it'll do the job but then
you have to be careful flush uh several
times afterwards so you don't have acid
sitting in your metal pipes the acid
will not bother the
porcelain that's
it here we go a clean toilet bowl this
did have calcium deposits in
it it is not the same toilet as the one
that I started the video with because I
was not thinking
video before I cleaned that
one but I did take take a picture of
it thank you
