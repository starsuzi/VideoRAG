hi this is Darren from Alo postery and
Interiors today I'm going to show you
how to poster this sofa
bed so now I'll be using 1/2 in foam for
the front edge
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now I'll be measuring for the center
point of the frame
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now I'll be cutting the fabric in a
straight line and then the letter
[Music]
b e
[Music]
now I'm just going to put a/4 inch
piping like this just on the top of the
edge so it protects the foam from
ripping from the
[Music]
wood now I'll be using half2 in burm
foam
[Music]
now I'll be cutting the foam in a 45Â°
angle so it's easier to staple
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now I'm using 1/4 inch foam for the
outside
[Music]
arm now I'm using 1/2 in foam for the
facing and then a thin layer of fiber
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now I'm just fixing the fiber and
pushing it towards the back
[Music]
now I'm cutting the letter v
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so now I'll be using tacking
strip make sure when you put it on it
should be in front of the piping
[Music]
so now you want to find where the wood
is and now following the grain of the
material you want to cut straight and
then the letter v
[Music]
then the letter v
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so this fabric I'm using is just for the
lining for the back
[Music]
[Music]
now I'll be using 2in soft foam for the
back
and
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
n
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
sh
[Music]
[Music]
now for the outside back you can either
use flexible attacking strips because of
the curve or you could use cardboard
tacking strips might be a little easier
but it takes a little longer in my
opinion but I'll be using halfin
cardboard to do this part
[Music]
[Music]
so after putting on the cardboard you
want to make sure the grain of the
fabric runs horizontally straight to the
other
[Music]
side now I'm using 1/4 in foam
[Music]
for the outside back I'll be using
tacking strips like this
[Music]
and here's how the finished product
looks
[Music]
