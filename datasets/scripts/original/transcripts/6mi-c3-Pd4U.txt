mocha we had a recipe sent in by Dale
and uh we're g to rev you know I got it
on my phone here that's why I have my
phone in my hand we're going to revise
it just a little because it looks like
he had a much larger drink than what we
are going to make so what does it
involve it involves shots of coffee
foamed milk with a little bit of heavy
whipping cream in there to foam it with
the machine we're going to put in a
smidge of white chocolate a smidge of
almond
extract and raw sugar if we choose to
and then why is the brevel milk Cafe
back here well it calls for a dollop of
whipped cream as well and I
said what about the milk Cafe I said why
don't we try it and see what happens I
tried it winner winner I don't if you
want to do it at home with yours I don't
know what it would do to it cuz it did
kind of bog it down but hey I thought
