hi my name is paula and i'm here to
introduce the aksa v-blade mandolin a
mandala is an essential tool for the
kitchen because it makes perfectly even
slices juliums and crinkle cuts in a
fraction of the time it would take with
a knife and cutting board this v-blade
mandolin is handy for softer fruits and
vegetables like tomatoes plums or
peaches
the textured ridges on top keep your
food from sticking which is helpful for
stickier vegetables like potatoes beets
or radishes
the other nice thing about the mandolin
is how easy it is to switch between the
blades and the slice thicknesses
all blades store neatly and securely
underneath the mandolin
and thicknesses are clearly marked on
this little knob on the side
you can adjust from a size as thin as 1
16 of an inch to as thick as a quarter
of an inch so let me demonstrate
firstly this slice is at 1 8 of an inch
i'll take my handy tomato and secure it
to this food holder this food holder has
four metal times that hold your fruits
and vegetables securely while you slice
but more importantly it keeps your
fingers away from the blade just slice
away on that v-shaped blade
notice how the non-slip feet allowed me
to slice quickly without the entire
mandolin slipping
and there you have it beautiful tomato
slices that are perfect for a salad
next i'll show you how to cut potatoes
for french fries first we unlock the gar
by pressing on the button on the dial
this opens up the bottom of the runway
then we take out the white plastic piece
lift up the top of the runway to pull
out the french fry blade to snap it back
into place where the white piece used to
be
close the bottom of the runway and lock
it into place
like we did with the tomato just secure
the potato to the food holder with the
metal tines and push it through the
mandolin blades see perfect slices for
french fries
you have to hand wash the blades but the
body and food holder are safe for the
top rack of the dishwasher the oxo
v-blade mandolin is sure to become a
go-to tool in your kitchen
