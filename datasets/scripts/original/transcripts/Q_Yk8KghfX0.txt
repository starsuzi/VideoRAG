hello haunt friends and I hope you enjoy
this glorious view of my dirty dirty
stove for this morning or evening or
whatever you get around watching this it
occurred to me that a while ago I put up
the papier-mâché recipe but I left out
one of the more critical
ingredients it's not critical it's kind
of titter miss you know but you know
it's on the damn recipe so I better not
be a lazy bum and show you how to make
it it is liquid starch and it's super
easy you can go out and get it it's a
laundry deter additive but um I really
recommend just making the damn stuff cuz
it's easy as all hell all you need to do
is boil water and
[Applause]
put I damn near threw the back of the
thing up first and put is that even lit
yes there ah and put corn starch in it
the cheapest least expensive corn starch
you
can it doesn't really make a difference
if you use the cheap Stu I just rather
use the cheap Stu cuz I don't want to
spend a fortune on it for every cup of
water you put in you're going to put in
three teaspoons of corn starch and
you're going to boil it together and
it's going to make liquid starch which
is this white
goo trust me it's critical I'm sure of
it I hopefully know by now so we're
going to mix some
up my own stock of it
is getting down to about a quarter full
and I have a new giant hand experiment
project that I need to get some stuff
ready for so I can properly mâché this
thing so going to refill my stock all
right so what we're going to do is we're
going to boil this stuff
first is there going to be time lapse
you better fraking believe it all right
so I'm going let this boil and then
since I used four cups of water I'm
going to throw in 12 tpoon of corn
starch I'm let the two boil together and
as the two boil together you're just
going to stir them around mix them
up and it's going to get kind of white
and
pasty uh you're going to kind of con the
consistency of really really gross
porridge too thin slimy Slurpee stuff
it's going to be a goop
like that but you'll see as we get to
it this will just save some time no I
don't normally mix the thing right here
nor I do it off to the side but see is
how when you do videos everybody's got
to see everything otherwise it's nothing
but questions questions
questions when you did that thing off
camera what were you
doing seemed kind of stupid St that you
were doing off camera considering that's
what this whole thing is
about y oh this is going to be
magical so
one I'm not sure what's going on here
but I'm sure it rhymes with bad idea
all right 12 teaspoonfuls of corn starch
and again I'm not sure how this is going
to come out in the editing but I don't
normally put it in a separate dish I
just add it right to it once this gets
boiling okay
there is our boiling
water into it goes the
starch and there's yet another reason
why I don't normally do it this
way well there you see about how much
you've got now thing to be careful of is
obviously this is starching water this
is going to want to boil over this is
not too terribly different it even wants
to boil over more when you stir it like
an idiot he even wants to do it cuz it's
it's like pasta effectively pasta's got
a lot of wheat starch all that good
stuff in there and it will want
to come over the top so just be
careful I don't remember this stuff
clumping as much in the past but I'm
just going to let this stuff boil
together until it's truly completely
separated what I am truly waiting for as
I look into the stuff I'm seeing a whole
whole lot of little
chunks of starch I remember those as
going
away so we'll find out how well my
memory holds I suppose another solution
might be to put the corn starch in water
hit it with a mixer get it really
Amalgamated and then boil that resulting
mix
[Music]
my old notes say it will clarify as it
boils and you can see how well that
turns out clear as a whistle wait
whistles aren't clear never mind never
mind you can see hopefully let's adjust
the pan and try to not spill it all over
myself how we've got kind of a whitish
fluid in there that's what you're going
for and again we're going to get it to
gravy consistency
that's pretty well boiled together and
I'm not going to gain too much more by
sitting here and continuing to boil it
and boil it and boil it I've got a
fairly good mix it's in good shape
there's chunks in there so if you do
this again certainly the next time I do
it I'm going to experiment by putting
the water in a bowl putting the corn
storage in there with it giving it a
good hit with the mixer evening it out
pouring it in and then boiling it see
what kind of result I get but in general
this is how you make liquid starch
starch water three teaspoons per cup of
water boil it together and that's it and
find someplace you want to store it I
have had this particular gallon of unit
of it since I started doing pumpkins uh
you can dump it in here if you keep it
in the fridge this thing is never
moldered it is has never gone bad on me
ever uh at room temperature I have had
it go bad but in fridge it's
fine then all I'm going to
do give it a dump
then make more or less as you choose
rinse and repeat until your liquid
starch amount is as much as you want to
have for
it hi welcome to the addendum to the
addendum so I'm sitting here after
making that first batch thinking God
I've told them like five times you could
probably just put the two together and
blend them with a mixer and and dump
that in the pot and then you wouldn't
get any of those annoying chunks and
maybe somebody should try
that so yeah I'm trying that save you
guys the time I already like the look of
it better it's at that milky consistency
before I even start so I am going to
boil This Together
carefully
hopefully and see if this makes a better
liquid starch than the last batch
seems in this method that the starch
water mix had a tendency to want to boil
over a lot faster so I'm just lowering
the heat down to a simmer to keep that
manageable I don't want this stff
blowing up out of my pot
yeah use this
[Music]
method a much there's the light much
more even mix no chunkies coming up in
that do
this take your starch take your water
put them together cold hit them with the
mixer disperse them evenly throughout
dump that mix in the pot boil it until
you get a gravy consistency done so
pretty much everything I told you in
that last
bit follow the recipe but not the method
because that was just stupid in a time
waste that I'm going to fast forward
through it as much as possible when I
finally edit this
video all right I'm not really sure
honestly what's to be gained by truly
boiling oiling it down I know like any
gravy if you let this sit out especially
with the corn starch in it it will start
to congeal so I'm going to try to give
you guys just a quick idea what the
consistency
is at this point it's pretty much water
with just a hair of
thickening um I noticed over on my stove
top here where I've been putting the
spoon this stuff over here has a
slightly more thick and congealed sense
to it so that's about what you're going
for don't break your back boiling this
thing all the live long day until it's a
slime I don't think that'll help you
particularly but definitely do blend it
up ahead of time this is liquid
starch this is your mâché
component all right that's it now you
know congratulations go forth make
pumpkins make monsters make
Halloween bye-bye
