hi welcome back today I want to show you
a very simple trick on how to keep your
avocado green and fresh after you cut it
if you want to see how I do that then
continue to watch so you've got your
Vacarro and the simple thing is just put
clean film on top of the avocado and
press it down so there's no oxygen and
snow space air or gaps between the
avocado and the cling film
and that's it and that will keep the
avocado fresh and green
for at least two days so there it is
guys that's how you keep your Vacarro
fresh and green for longer if you'd like
to see more tips like this then
subscribe to my channel and I'll see you
next time thank you for watching bye
