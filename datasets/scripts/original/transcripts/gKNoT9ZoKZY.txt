when you finished knitting your garment
you're going to want to sew a label in
it so everyone will know who made it and
I'm going to show you now how I sew mine
in of course you have to thread your
needle and then I put it in the
corner as close to the top as I can get
it pull the needle
through then I place the label in the
Center at the back of the
neck and I sew the first Corner
in just with a few stitches you want to
use the smallest littlest needle that
you possibly
can two times usually
works then you pull your thread down and
in this case my label is folded so I'm
going to put put my needle through in
the
bottom like
so and then do another couple of
stitches I usually do
two like
so and then I'm going to turn it upside
down my thread is still in this corner
and I'm going to pull it
through to the top corner on the other
side this is all so you don't have to
cut the thread every time so I've put
the needle through the top Corner going
to do another two
stitches then again I'm going to put it
underneath pull it through
and put it
through the corner on the
bottom do another
two then I'm going to knot my
thread on the third
Stitch pull it
through stick the needle under
and
through then I'm going to get my
scissors and cut the
thread and that is how you
sew a label in there you go
