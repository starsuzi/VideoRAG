so how to cook cabbage this is a savoy
cabbage has a crenellated surface a
little more exciting than the basic
green cabbage
so there are softer heads that make sure
none are damaged cut this in half and
remove the stem
or the core of it right out
separate that and then you can slice it
by slice it in half
from off the south pole right and then
you want to shred it
um from horizontal
but to the side i've also thinly sliced
some onions i have two cloves of garlic
that i've minced
when our pan gets hot we're going to add
some olive oil to the pan
because in this process we're actually
going to
to
saute
the onions for this green cabbage
preparation
and add the garlic i like to make sure i
put the
onions in first so the pan was preheated
the oil starts to move then you know
it's hot you got a little sizzle
some onions in first
i have to use this kind of braising pan
that works very well for cabbage
especially with a braised a green
cabbage here's a great flavor
you know cabbage is very healthy for you
so having that
vegetable more often prepared this way i
think you really enjoy it so that's
sweating very nicely
i'm going to bring over
my savoy cabbage like i guess i can say
julienne
or shredded
all right
so there you go with that
so that's
a little flavor you know get a little a
little um
caramelization not that as much sugar in
cabbage
but you know it just intensifies the
flavor unlike red cabbage we don't cover
green vegetables so that's searing
nicely
i'm going to add
about a three quarters of a cup of
tomato sauce
i'm going to add
a big pinch of herbs to provence which
is fennel seed lavender and thyme or you
just use regular thyme
dry thyme is fine
i'm going to add
two pinches of black pepper
i'm gonna do a big
pinch of salt
and i'm going to let that simmer nice
and slow
until it's tender
okay the braised green cabbage with
tomato and garlic
and the fresh thyme herbs and provence
nice and tender
absorb all the liquid if it's still
too crunchy for you add more stock and
that's fine i did braise a little longer
you'll find that cabbage is much more
desirable
when sauteed or braised
then boiled
and then the front it really smells
wonderful too the the last part is
little chopped parsley
and your guests really enjoyed your
braised green cabbage with tomato and
garlic and onion
