hi guys welcome back to my Channel today
I'm going to show you how to make this
beautiful eyelid dress so if you want to
learn how keep on
watching as you can see I already
pre-cut all my fabrics and obviously I'm
going to be using two Fabrics the black
eyelid Fabric and the lining is a jersey
material here I am showing you how to
make a neck facing so you basically just
Trace the shoulder seams and the
neckline half SE shape and you're just
going to cut it
out this facing is for the front piece
and you are going to do the same for the
back piece you're just going to trace
the back bodice the same way like I did
earlier and you will have something like
this as you can see the front piece is a
little deeper than the back piece so you
will have six pieces of
Fabrics Al together for the
[Music]
top as you can see I already pinned the
lining on the actual
fabric going to treat this fabric as one
so I'm going to sew them together
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
so if you want to learn how to make your
own bodies pattern I'm just going to
leave the link in the description box
below so you can go ahead and watch
it also I am going to attempt to attach
a side zipper that's why the side seam
allowance on the left side is a little
um wider than the right side
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and now you're just going to repeat the
same process on the back
piece and here I am sewing the neck
facing together be sure that the right
sides of the fabric are facing each
other
and now I'm getting ready to sew the two
pieces together and of course right
sides are facing each
[Music]
other and here I am sewing the shoulder
seams and the next is side seam just one
side seam because the other one is for
the zipper that will be the last step
[Music]
here I'm just using 1/2 in seam
[Music]
allowance and it should look like this
it is looking pretty
already and this is where the zipper is
going to be I gave it 1 in allowance for
the
zipper now it's time to attach the neck
facing as you can see the right side of
the fabric is facing out and you are
just going to match the side seams
[Music]
first and then pin it to secure all the
way around
[Laughter]
[Music]
and you're just going to sew it all the
way around and be sure that you are
catching three Fabrics the main fabric
lining and of course the neck
[Music]
facing and then you're just going to
fold it in and I will finish that later
on I will h Stitch it but basically
that's how it's done and as you can see
I surged the row edges of the neck
facing I ended up trimming it off
because it curled up the neck facing
tremendously and now I am going to top
Stitch it to prevent the neck facing
from sticking up
[Applause]
[Music]
and now it's time to attach the bottom
piece of the dress I have two yards here
that I will cut in
half and you will also need two Ys for
the
[Music]
lining and by the way I am going to take
advantage of the finished hemline here
so I don't have to do it later
on now I'm just going to sew the side
seam all the way down to the hemline
[Music]
now I'm going to sew the lining on the
black fabric I'm just going to sew it
like this all the way on the other end
[Music]
and now I'm going to fold the fabric
like this the reason why is I want to
give this eyelid fabric some body
because it was so thin so I decided to
do that and I'm just going to trim the
excess lining off later
on now it's time to attach the bodies to
the skirt I'm sorry guys there was a
missing clip here when I was doing the
pleading I accidentally forgot to push
the record button so forgive me for that
promise you I'm going to do another
pleated tutorial one of these
days and here I am just doing a basting
stitch just to hold the pleats
[Music]
together and now I am just going to pin
the bodice on the skirt right sides are
facing each other
[Music]
[Applause]
and then sew it all along the
edge here I'm just going to sew it just
on top of the bathing
[Music]
Stitch and here I am doing the armhole
facing so how to make the armhole facing
is pretty much the same like we did for
the neck
facing and here I'm just going to sew it
about a/4 of an inch from The Edge so
I'm just going to sew it from here to
the other
[Music]
end and here I am sewing the side seam
of the dress where the zipper is going
to be
on the first 11 in I'm going to do a
basting stitch and then from there down
all the way to the hemline I'm going to
do a regular
[Music]
Stitch and now I'm just going to place
the zipper right in the middle of the
the seam I'm just going to pin it to
secure
[Music]
I just basically follow the
manufacturer's instruction for this one
[Music]
actually after I sewn it I'm going to
sim rip the basting stitch that I made
earlier and yay I have a zipper it
worked
[Music]
now it's time to finish the neck facing
I'm just going to fold it in and fold it
one more time in the inside to hide the
raw edges I'm actually going to hand
Stitch it later
on and of course it is the same process
for the armhole
facing just going to fold it in and then
fold the raw edges and then I'm going to
hand Stitch it
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and now I am ready to finish the armhole
facing I'm going to start by making a
loop and tying it to
secure for a few
[Applause]
times and then I'm going to do probably
about half an inch distance from each
other
and I'm going to Loop it just like
[Music]
this and be sure that you are only
catching two Fabrics the facing and the
lining
[Music]
and then I'm going to repeat the same
process for the neck
facing and that should be
[Music]
done so that's it for today and I really
hope that you like this dress that I
made today and if you like it be sure to
