okay ke we going to have a little fun
and this ain't not but a little fun
video is kind of how I make my hot water
cornbread
now what I use is as you can see I use
at your mama buttermilk cornmeal mix and
I also while I had some Crisco butter
flavor short it but you can use
vegetable
oil uh you know whatever oil you use and
as you can see it's melting in the pan
frying pan I put enough in there so I
can cover the the pettes that I'm going
to make the hot water cornbread and as
you can see the hot water is over here
now what you want to do is to make sure
the wall is hot and make sure the grease
is hot
uh hold
on okay uh we back now so so what I did
I put a little bit of cor meal in here
in in the bowl now some people put
sugar a teaspoon of sugar or two
teaspoon of sugar and some people put
salt some people could put flour but
this right here is self-rising cornmeal
so I don't put nothing so right now the
the grease is warm hot you got to have
it hot and the water got to be be hot so
what we going to do we going to stir
pour some hot water in here don't put
too much put a little bit at a time
because you just want it kind of lumpy
where you can put it in you can take
your hands and put it in
patties some people use yolow
cornmeal and and whatever but like I say
I I love the taste of
uh of self rising an your mama self
rising cornmeal it make good I got some
muffins in the stove also
I'm just
showing how to make uh you don't want it
too soupy you want it at a a pace where
you can kind of like roll it up in a
bowl make Pates out of it like you would
make a
hamburger or whatever just like
that let me see just a little bit more
okay now what we going to
do is
uh make sure your hands is
clean make sure your hands is clean and
make sure you got some cold
water make sure you got some cold water
beside
you just in case the corn meal
get it's too hot for you you can dip
your hands in
you can dip your hands in the what's
called in the water so what you want to
do you want to take
uh some and put it in you cuz this right
here is it'll be kind of warm and you
want to roll it real good you can make
it fat or
skinny any size you want I like mine
kind of like this like a Patty and you
want to lay it in the
grease you want your grease hot
but see I I ain't worried about it I got
time so it's hot now the uh cornmeal is
hot from the from the hot water you want
to lay it in there you want to make it
kind of pretty like I say some
people they put it they put all kinds of
stuff in there they put some people put
cheese in there or whatever and you make
it real like that and you put it in
there now these are good the hot water
cornbread is good with pinto beans
greens um you know anything you eat
cornbread with but it good though I'm
not lying it's
good like I said you can make
them you can make it any
any size you want little big or
whatever but the whole thing is is it
roll it like this it going it going to
be kind of warm the the bread going to
be kind of
warm but and you let them cook till they
Brown on the on the uh they Brown on one
side and you can tell they getting Brown
by looking at the bottom of
it and they are good
delicious I mean delicious
and you can use like I said you can use
vegetable
oil or any kind of oil you want to
you but make sure this right
here make sure your your uh oil is hot
when you put it in and just let it cook
and
brown whatever now I got to get my
muffins out the stove see what I do I
cook my kale greens I cook a big batch
and see the these are my muffins I just
cooked I cook my
muffins but I was just
showing how to cook hot water
cornbread like I say people
cook the way they want to cook this is
the way I cook
them and uh I'll be back when I turn
them over
[Music]
okay I'm about ready I'm about ready to
turn them over so what you got to you
got to do you got to be careful when you
turn them over
because usually I have more oil in here
than this but I'm just showing somebody
how to cook them so see there they
golden
brown and then you know grease will SP
Splash on you so be
careful I mean hot water cornbread
is good
with greens I eat mine with greens and
Pinto
beIN anything that you usually
eat cornbread
with this is the best I mean I know you
can bake cornbread
whatever but this is the
best okay as you can see these are brown
now I'm going to let them get brown on
the other
side and uh look at that got God
Almighty boy this thing you got a plate
of greens either pinto beans and neck
bones and uh boy I'm telling you the
truth when this when he get through and
you lay them on the uh the paper towel
to drain some of the oil out and you put
butter on them and just
wait man I'm telling you I'll be back
when it get done
okay there you have
it nice crisp hot water cornbread they I
put them on here so they can drain some
of the uh oil off of here uh so there
you have it hot water
cornbread man they are good look at look
how beautiful they look the muffins and
the hot water cornbread what I would do
is I'll put these in a in a in a bag a
plastic bag freezer bag or either a fold
them up in some foil and I save them so
only thing I have to do is just heat
them up in the microwave when I need
them so there you have it hot water
cornbread like I say you can put
anything in there you want it and you
can make them big little thin of fat but
you got to fry them good on both Sid you
make sure the water is hot you make sure
the grease is hot you make sure you have
your a cup of water beside you so when
you Pat them if they warm if they hot if
the water if they cornmeal is too hot
for you you can put your hands in in the
water to cool them off so there you have
it good old southern hot water cornbread
