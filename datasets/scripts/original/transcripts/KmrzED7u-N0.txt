oh no you got a clog sink so do I no big
deal I'm here to help you out see
basically uh the clog sink you know you
can tell when it stops draining uh when
you're looking in as you can see I tried
to grind up some beets that were in here
today um and the big difference is you
know normally you hear it sound but it's
just spinning
now nothing's going nothing's going down
sounds like a sea monster in there so
easy enough probably all it is is you
got some little bits that have just
gotten too uh churned up and it's just
clogging it up right where the pipes
need to go so we're going to show you
how to fix it right
now okay so probably the best thing
you're going to want to do is you're
going to want to towel just in case uh
for some water you're going to need a
bucket and you're going to need a
flashlight uh flashlight so you can see
so basically here's your disposal right
here and everything's coming in here
getting turned up and it spits out here
and it tries go out your main drain line
but sometimes things get clogged up
right here uh at this bracket where it's
trying to come in and then go down um if
if water isn't getting through there
then it can't push the stuff out so it
can't get it through the drain so
probably what you're going to want to do
is I would suggest um you're going to
yours may be a little bit different but
these are just little hand
uh hand brackets here that you can just
undo so I would recommend doing this and
undoing it and letting the water drain
into your bucket
um and you're going to have to you may
have to undo both of them at the same
time
but and just see what what it is that
pulls out so this one is going to be
over here uh that's going to be the best
but it's going to get a little wet in
here so the best thing to do is just
pull it quickly and try to
get the junk through
there now it doesn't look good and
that's all the water that was uh stuck
up in my sink that is draining out and
uh so that's going to take just a second
to to drain out it's pretty gross I know
what you're going to find in there is
some pretty gross stuff but so actually
um a lot of the clog just came out but
but what you can
see and this is see the main the main
clog is is in here um but as you can see
it's a lot of this
little there's some quinoa some kale
some beets in there um but the gross
stuff is actually going to be right in
here right where I said it
was and you can
see that it's just a bunch of little
things um
that you know really just hard to grind
up uh small so when they go through the
disposal doesn't work as well um because
there's nothing to grind up so it just
gets stuck in there um so basically just
reach in there
and pull out the drain or pull out the
clog there's a bunch of little beet
spiralized beets in there um clean that
out as best you
can and
should see some water
there and then it's as simple
as uh and there's a lot of really gross
stuff in there but it's as simple now as
putting it back in
there putting your pipes back
together screwing them back
on make sure these are real tight
because you don't want any water leaking
out back on there guy there we
go all right
and let see
here and now your drain is perfectly
clear
