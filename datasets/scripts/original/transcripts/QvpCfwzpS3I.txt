well get a kurd nerds I'm Gavin from
littleg greenw workshops.com that and
littlegreen cheese.com and today we're
going to talk about mold and that's
unwanted mold now you probably have seen
in an earlier video that I made some
butter or
baser and this is um this cheese is in a
vacuum pack bag as you can see and the
problem was the seal broke somehow so uh
it started to grow mold now I've
resealed it let's check out what I did
and how I did
it well there's the cheese you can see
that the bag is a little bit open and if
you flip it over there you can see the
Blue Mold forming that's because oxygen
has got into the bag because the seal is
broken so let's Rectify that let's take
the cheese out of the bag
pretty simple just use some very sharp
scissors cut that open now if you hadn't
noticed this under wax exactly the same
process just remove the wax from the
cheese just make sure it's on a nice
clean
board yes that's a
baser and what we do is we use a Ramin
or whatever other small container you
have and you put in some brine solu
solution so basically this is a 1 cup of
water to 2 tbspoon of salt or cheese
salt and then you just with a lintree
cloth you basically wipe off the
mold so any imperfections or any blue
spots there just uh dunk the the cloth
back in again and as you can see there
I'm wiping that all over to get rid of
the Blue Mold now if you need to pick
out or dig a little bit of the cheese
out that's fine as well and just to make
sure it's all wiped
off now it's okay if it's moist that's
fine don't forget to do the other side
as well just in case even though that
didn't have any mold on
it and just wipe that
down now don't wipe it so hard that it
actually starts digging into the cheese
a lot but just wipe it over so you
remove the mold that's what we're trying
to do now if you do have persistent
molder on your cheese add a teaspoon of
vinegar to the brine solution and that
will definitely kill any of the
mold um before you seal it back up again
so basically what I did I just put it
back into a new bag not the same one cuz
that was contaminated and just resealed
it again using my vacuum
sealer now the name of the vacuum sealer
is the sunburn theme food saver if
anybody's interested and I use the bags
that come with
it now don't forget to relabel the bag
so you know what cheese it
is and in this case it's
bazer and it's going to be open on New
Year's
Day anyway there's the cheese nice and
lovely and saved
