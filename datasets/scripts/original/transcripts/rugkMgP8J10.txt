This year, I got a baby brother! He's super
cool...
...but boy is he messy!
So I help my mom keep his toys and stuff clean!
I add a tiny bit of Baking Soda into a bowl
of water and clean everything with a sponge.
Then I rinse it really well.
There's no chemicals to worry about and it's
easy to use!
Mom says I'm the best big sister ever!
