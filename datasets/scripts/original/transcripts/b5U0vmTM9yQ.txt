Lots of commercially made cleaning products
are made with dangerous chemicals, that can
cause breathing problems, skin irritations,
and pollute the air in your home. When you
make a natural disinfectant with common, cheap
household items, you reduce your exposure
to noxious chemicals and keep your house clean.
In today’s video we’re going to show you

disinfectant.
You can use it to: clean your house, clean
the floor, clean toilets, sanitize any surface,
and it even smells nice!
The tip is to save the peel from the lemons
you use throughout the day.
This recipe can also be made using orange
or tangerine peel. It’s easy and the result
is excellent: a naturally clean and good smelling
house.
Ingredients:
Peel from 4 lemons;
300 milliliters of water (1 ¼ cup); 3 tablespoons
