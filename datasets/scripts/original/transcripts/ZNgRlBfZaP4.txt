so what we're going to do now is we're
going to use a jigsaw and we're going to
cut these off on the jigsaw I'm not so
sure that these are perfectly straight
so I'm just going to use the jigsaw you
could use a table
saw but we're going to use a jigsaw here
so we'll just cut these out and then
we'll get them inside and start
installing our next row

to that's kind of what it's going to
look
like a jigsa is definitely a tool that
you're going to want to have for a saw
also we use a chop saw which is a saw
that just comes down it also does 45s
it's a miter
box and so those are the kinds of tools
that you're going to need for cutting um
you can get away of not having a table
saw if you have a jigsaw so for sure
this is the tool that you're going to
need as a jigsaw
