Water in Basement/Crawl Space
Without the right drainage system, rainwater
and landscape runoff can soak into the ground
near your home’s foundation and make its
way into your basement or crawl space, causing
flooding and the growth of dangerous mold,
mildew and wood rot.
With wet wood, you’ve got the perfect environment
for termite and other insect infestations.
Instead of using a properly installed drainage
system, many homeowners try quick-fixes such
as moving dirt and digging trenches, and end
up dissatisfied because these approaches are
most often ineffective and temporary.
Water in your basement or crawl space is among
the most complex drainage problem to solve,
which is why NDS recommends hiring a qualified
contractor.
Installing an NDS drainage system such as
EZ-Drain can prevent water from entering your
basement or crawl space by capturing the water
before it reaches your home and carrying it
to a safe discharge point.
With NDS you can create a lasting drainage
solution easily and inexpensively.
