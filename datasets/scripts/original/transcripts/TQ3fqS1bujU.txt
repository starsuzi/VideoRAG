hi guys so today's video is going to be
how to clean your saddle so the things
that you are going to need are a saddle
horse so I am just using a metal
one you're also going to need a
[Music]
sponge some subtle soap I'm using the
linken lzed leather soap
[Music]
you'll also need a bowl of lukewarm
water and optionally you can use some
form of tack conditioner at the
end so go ahead and grab your saddle I
am using Lucy's saddle because that is
the one that needed a wash and just
begin removing um any saddle covers
numbness Etc please excuse the pajama
bottom but I was filming this at 10:00
at
[Music]
night you'll also want to remove your
sturrup leathers and irons as we'll be
washing these separately
[Music]
so to start you're going to want to wet
your sponge if it's is a completely dry
sponge then it might need a few dips in
the water before it's nice and damp the
key is that your sponge is damp and not
wet so you want to ring it out
well then lifting the flap of the saddle
up I always start on the inside and do
the bottom
section so you just want to go ahead and
wipe all over the inside flap and I will
say um that Lucy settle is fairly new
therefore it's not very porous so the
water tends to stay on the top of the
leather and not soaking so it does
appear rather wet on camera but in fact
it's
fine and also Lucy has a synthetic
section which is the light brown on
camera and that's for her add justable
knee pad hence why I'm not wiping
that you also want to make sure that you
get into all the nooks and crannies as
this is where any sweat and things like
that will be hidden and that's where the
dirt builds
[Music]
up so you want to go ahead and ring your
sponge out and just clean it make sure
that again it is damp not wet
[Music]
and then you want to add a bit of the
leather soap on at first you might find
that you have to add quite a bit and
just to get a nice
[Music]
Leather So then begin in circular
motions all over where you have just wet
your saddle with the um soap and
sponge so if you find that you have too
much leather like I did use the other
side of your sponge and it will not be
quite as
bad this is a bit too much leather I did
go bit OT with the soap so I added a bit
of water just to dilute
it and then you want to rinse it all off
with a sponge with no soap
on so now we're going to do exactly the
same for the underside of the flat lap
so I'm using again a damp sponge to go
over it all and then I'll go over it
with soap and then I will rinse
[Music]
off now you want to go and do the top
section of the flap and under the
skirt so it's exactly the same process a
damp sponge followed by soap followed by
a damp sponge
[Music]
[Music]
you'll now probably want to change the
water as it'll be getting a bit dirty
and again make sure that it is luk warm
and not
hot then just repeat exactly what we did
for the flaps on this side of the saddle
for the other side
[Music]
so now we're going to be focusing on the
seat of the saddle so this is where
you'll probably get any scratches or
anything like that so it's important to
P close attention to any scratches as
they will Harbor dirt and will look even
worse so again it's just exactly the
same procedure and um it's good idea to
pay attention to the pommel of your
saddle as well as the back to make sure
that all the crevices are
[Music]
cleaned again repeat the exact same
method for the back of your saddle
seat again you'll find that it gets
quite repetitive you're doing exactly
the same stages for each different
section of the
saddle to clean the inside side of your
saddle I recommend putting a towel or
other soft padded um surface on the
ground this is just to protect any
leather work and just pop your saddle on
it so it's exactly the same method
however you need to do it in a lot more
detail for the underneath there's a lot
more sewing um sections and a lot more
surface area so the underneath of my
saddle always takes me the longest and
obviously this is the section most
closely contact with your horse
depending on how your n fits um so it
can get quite dirty and dusty so I like
to pay um very close attention to the
underneath of my
saddle so that is the main body of your
saddle finished so just pop it back on
your saddle horse to dry while we look
at these
stups so the first thing you want to do
with these stups is go ahead and remove
REM the stir in so we can clean that
[Music]
first so all I tend to do with the syrup
is just using little warm water and a
sponge just give it a good scrub and
remove any of the dirt the treads on the
stir pay are generally the hardest but
if you have a old horse face brush then
this can be really useful in getting the
dirt
out as for the stup leather we do
exactly the same as we have for all the
other leather work and that is just the
damp sponge then the sponge with soap
and then a damp sponge again to clean it
all and I like to pay close attention to
any of the sewing so where it has been
sewn because this is generally where
you'll find a buildup of of
dirt and of course you want to repeat
this for the other
strip so once it is all dried go ahead
and put your saddle back together if you
want this could be the time to condition
it I didn't do that for Lucy saddle on
this occasion but I hope you enjoy this
video and I'll see you guys soon don't
