hi this is Chef Baro today I'm going to
show you the easy way to fry okra in a
skillet with flour to get started you'll
want your Skillet over medium high
heat then I'm going to add a half a cup
of oil to the pan to start heating up
you can use any type of oil that's good
for a high heat today I'm just using
canola oil then then I'm going to get my
okra ready for the breading here I have
some washed whole okra and I'm just
going to trim the
ends and then cut into half inch
pieces now that my okra is sliced I'm
going to get my flour mixture ready to
go in a bowl I
have 1/2 cup of allpurpose
flour and a half a cup of yellow
cornmeal then I'm just going to add a
little bit of salt and pepper to season
it and this is where you can start to
get creative with the coating by using a
variety of different spices today I'm
going to use about a tablespoon of my
favorite cajun spice
mix now I'm just going to blend this all
together until mixed
in another Bowl I'm going to get 1/2 cup
of
Buttermilk let me check my
oil okay now my oil is ready for frying
first I'm going to get my sliced okra
and put it in the buttermilk and I'm
just going to toss it just a little bit
so that it's
coated then I'm going to put the okra in
my flour cornmeal and spice mixture
then just toss it good I like using my
hands so I can get a better coating on
it and once everything is nice and
coated with the cornmeal flour mixture
it is ready to fry
you can already smell the spice is
getting heated up and it smells
delicious this is a great recipe that's
really easy that's a great way to
introduce okra into any
meal you will want to fry your okra for
about 2 minutes on each side until
Browns this is Chef Maro showing you the
easy way way to fry okra in a skillet
with flour enjoy
