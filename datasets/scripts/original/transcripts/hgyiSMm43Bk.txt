I'm going to show you how to make honey
feta felo pies first of all you need to
take your P pastry out of its pack and
lay it next to where you're going to be
working on a cool surface now
felo is very thin and very very delicate
and it dries very quickly and when it
dries it goes brittle and then you can't
bend it or use it cuz it cracks so the
best thing to do take it out of the
fridge take it out the pack lay it on
your work surface and cover
it with a cloth now this cloth I've
rinsed it in cold water and rung all the
moisture out so it's just damp it's not
wet it's just damp and I've covered the
pastry with it and it keeps it moist and
keeps it from drying out so that's a
really important
tip right now I'm going to make the
filling so I'm taking my little
bowl in goes my feta
cheese
oil we want two
tablespoons runny
honey four
teaspoons don't have to be super exact
with
this
here we
go and two teaspoons of dried
oregano just scrape all the rest of the
honey off
there
and I'm going to mix the lot
together there we go that's
fine right and I'm going to put all all
this other ingredients to the side and
the filling I've just made to the
side I've got my pck time
ready olive oil ready and the pastry
brush ready because as soon as we take
the fer pastry out we don't want to be
waiting around cuz it's going to be
drying all the time
so take my first
sheet lay it on my
board cover it back up you must remember
to do this otherwise it will start
drying
brush very
lightly with a bit of olive
oil
you just want it very lightly brushed
not not damp with oil sprinkle with a
few time
leaves I'm going to just put another
sheet of fer on
top just like that
okay I'll cut it down the middle with a
sharp
knife and that's the pastry ready to put
the pie filling
on here's my
filling now I'm going to take a small
Spoonful and pop it on on the
middle of one of my pastry
sheets maybe a couple more bits there we
are shape it roughly into a rectangle
like that doesn't have to be super
accurate roughly a
rectangle I'll do the other one while
see
here
now first I roll as
side it's a bit like wrapping a present
in
this all the sides into pastry Meats in
the
middle take the bottom
up and the top
down there's parcel one
same thing with parcel
two pastry should meet in the
middle bottom
up top
down now here I've got a baking sheet
I've just rubbed with a tiny bit of oil
so nothing sticks to
it I'm going to
lift the pies on
and the side with the seal I'm going to
put underneath so the weight of the
ingredients holds it
closed and when you made all of them
brush with a little bit of
oil and pop in the
oven
