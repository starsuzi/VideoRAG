a couple different ways to peel tomatoes
when you're canning or whatever you're
doing with them one way is a melon
baller and you can just take and scoop
out just like that that fast I don't
know if you saw that if I had it right
you just take and stick it in and twirl
it around and it takes the core out and
if you're canning and you need to peel
them you're going to make a little extol
it'll X on the bottom and then the other
way I like to do it is i take my finger
and I put on the end of the knife so
there's just a little bit and you just
take and go all the way around so i
think the melon baller one is a little
bit faster so whatever whatever you
choose to use you can peel them or core
them actually pretty fast so i hope that
helps
