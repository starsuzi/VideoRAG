In this Saturday Strategy, we're making a
all-organic, save your life, change your life mosquito repellant.
I like that! Listen up because mosquitoes are the number one killer on the planet. Believe it.
And we're going to protect you with this homemade, all-natural organic mosquito spray right here. Let's go! Boom!
We are going to fill this little spray bottle with our own organic all-natural bug spray.
Most bug sprays have aerosols... All types of chemicals, like some of it are [inaudible], like super toxic stuff.
We're going to start out real real quick and easy with 3 ounces of water.
Eucalyptus? Eucalyptus. We're going to get ten dashes of eucalyptus. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...
Ten dashes of the lemon essential oil -one, two, three, four, five, six, twelve, ten.
And then five dashes of peppermint oil. Got it.
Another thing about the peppermint -increases your cognitive function. Oh wow! I feel smarter already.
it also calms the mind too. You can rub that on your temples, yeah, because it's cooling.
And tit's also great for digestion, yeah, you rub it on your stomach.
Alright, so we get five of those - 1,2,3,4,5 - and its gonna make it smell good when you pour it on yourself.
Let's go, alright. Eucalyptus, peppermint and lemon. So remember that. Write that down.
It's gonna be in the comments below as well.
We got witch hazel. Do you like it? I don't know. This one's rose-scented. That's a win.
Three ounces of that as well. Put that in little water and our essential oils.
Yup, and then one little teaspoon of the rubbing alcohol and we're good to go.
Oh! There it is.
Now mix that up. We put it in our spray
bottle.
I don't know that it's all going to fit in there but we've got to get it dialed in.
It's gonna fit perfectly actually because that's how the universe works, my friend.
Don't spill. Look at that! The universe says
yes, shake it up a little bit before you use it each time.
Pop the top off, give it a little "wow"!
Attract the significant other and repel mosquitoes.
So awesome! We're guarded at a personal level.
And also why is it important to block yourself from mosquitoes?
Because the Zika virus, all the things that could really disrupt, chicken cucamonga whatever that, malaria,
Malaria, so all this stuff is going on.
That we were just in Tulum recently, they
had signs all over the place for that.
So making sure that you have mosquito repellent that's healthy that doesn't have raid
and these other plastic carcinogens actually in it.
That you're spraying on your body disrupting your whole endocrine system, your hormone system.
These essential oils... this is plant botanicals, nature's best stuff right here .
We're going to leave the recipe below this video as well.
Let us know what your secret recipe is for bug spray.
if you want to add a little coconut oil to this, I do this sometimes as well,  and that actually blocks the sun too.
So you're getting a 15 to 20 spf with this repellent and it works out well .
At the end of the day, everything, your skin's your biggest organ everything you put on your skin your body absorbs
So you want to make sure that you're putting something good on it. Yep! And you could drink it. So good?
As always Drew, Neils, remember we're in this together.
