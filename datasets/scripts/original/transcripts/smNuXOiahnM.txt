hello and welcome back to my channel
today I'm going to show you how to make
three easy mini snowglobe lip balms if
you're new to my channel and you'd like
to see future DIY videos please click
that subscribe button and if you enjoy
this video please give it a thumbs up to
get started you will need some of these
lip gloss or bead containers
you will also need some acrylic paint i'm going to use
this sterling silver color
i put some paint into the bottom of a plastic cup
and then what I did was I took the
bottom of the lip balm container and I
swirled it around into the paint if you
don't want to do it this way you can
also use a paintbrush and paint it on
once the bottom is fully coated with
paint just set that aside and let it dry
here is mine once it was dried
now to make the lip balm i'm going to place a
glass container onto a mug warmer
you can also use the double boiler
method I'm going to add one tablespoon
of beeswax and 1 tablespoon of coconut
oil and let that melt down
once it melted down to give it some scent i'm
going to use some vanilla extract
I just mixed a little bit of that in
and stirred it together
to tint this lip balm i'm going to
use some lipstick that i had and i just
cut off a little piece put that into
the mixture and let that melt down
add the lip balm mixture to the bottom
of the lip balm container set that in
the refrigerator for about 15 to 30 minutes
and here is mine after i took it out of the refrigerator
now to make the
snowglobe part what you want to do is
remove the top from the lip balm
container for this one I'm going to use
these little gingerbread beads you can
use any type of bead or you can make
your own creation with polymer clay
what you want to do is you'll just want a hot
glue the pieces onto the top of the lip
balm container
once the pieces are glued on you'll just
want to let that hot glue cool down
next you'll need some of these one ounce portion cups
i'm going to add water to
the portion cup about halfway to
three-quarters up then i'm going to use
some iridescent glitter and add that to the water
stir the glitter into the water
clean off the inside part of the cup to
make sure that there is no water or
glitter with some hot glue go around the
top part of the lip balm container using
a fairly thick amount of hot glue then
turn the lid upside down and place it in
the cup making sure to set it in
straight let the glue cool down for
about five to ten minutes before
flipping it over
now you can place your lip balm
container back together and that is how
you make a liquid lip balm snowglobe
another option if you don't want to
paint the bottom you can use some of
this thin duct tape and just go around
the bottom with the duct tape
the next snow globe for the lip balm i'm
just going to melt down a chapstick to
give this one some tint i am just going
to use a piece of lipstick again I'm
going to use my mug warmer and a glass
container to melt that down
once it has melted down i'm going to add some
peppermint flavor to this one this is an optional step
again i'm going to use one
of the containers that i painted i'm
going to add the lip balm mixture to
that and set that in the refrigerator
for 15 to 30 minutes
this snow globe i'm going to use one of
these mini Christmas trees if you don't
have one of these you can also make a
mini christmas tree out of pipe cleaners
i just added some hot glue to the bottom
and secured that to the top of the lip
balm container lid
for this snow globe i'm going to use
some fake snow you can find this at
walmart the dollar store or a craft store
I just filled the portion cup about a
quarter to half the way up and then i
used the same procedure of applying hot
glue to the top portion of the lip balm
container and glueing that upside down into the portion cup
once the hot glue
cools down then you can flip it over and
there you have your tree with your snow
and that is how you make this snow globe
lip balm
and for the last snow globe lip balm i'm
going to use the same procedure of
melting down 1 tablespoon of beeswax
and 1 tablespoon of coconut oil once
that has melted down if you want to add
flavoring just go ahead and mix that
into the mixture and then tint this one
i'm just going to use some eyeshadow
once it's all mixed together then just
add the mixture to the bottom portion of
the lip balm container and set that in
the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes
and here is mine once it was dried as
you can see with the eyeshadow it's not
as pigmented as when you first put it in
for this one on the portion cup i'm just
going to use some Sharpie markers and
i'm going to draw on a snowman face
the fake snow for this one I'm going to
use some epson salt
i added about a half a cup to three-quarters of cup of epsom salt
hot glue around the top portion of
the lip balm container top and then glue
that to the portion cup
once the hot glue has cooled down flip it over and
that is how you make your snowman snow
globe lip balm i hope you enjoyed all
