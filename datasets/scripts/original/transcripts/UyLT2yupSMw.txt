hello everybody and merry christmas eve
today's christmas eve isn't it yeah and
tomorrow mornings there's gonna be on
presents under a tree you think so
i bet so
so we are here on christmas eve and we
have a few things going today
um i need to make some treats i'm going
to take to a christmas eve party that
we're going to tonight whose house are
we going to cindy and how would our tic
tac toy fans know sydney
it's because she's in videos that's
right we filmed with sydney and
tori which are two of our neighbors just
yesterday and so this evening we're
going to a christmas eve party at
sydney's house
and i need to make a desserts i'm going
to work on the dessert right now and
what are we doing before
the christmas eve party
where are we going we're going to this
we're going to this to my necklace
um church to church we're going to go to
church on christmas eve but i just
showed you what mama's making okay i'm
going to go show what we're making all
right we'll go look over here i'm trying
to be kind of quiet because baby oh is
asleep upstairs and i need him to sleep
so i can get this um baking done i guess
it's not really baking but
yes we're gonna make s'mores treats or
at least mommy's gonna make s'mores
treats they're kind of like rice krispie
treats but they're s'mores treats they
have golden grahams which are kinda like
the graham crackers marshmallows and
mini chocolate chips and they are
delicious they're always a hit so i'm
excited to eat them and hopefully
we're not going to eat them all before
we have to take them tonight and addie
is over here what are you doing addie
she's reading her american girl doll
book her be forever yesterday it's about
moving so i'm gonna let her read and i'm
gonna go cook are you gonna help me make
the food maya yeah okay perfect but we
have marshmallows i'll show you okay go
get them all right the first step is to
line a nine by 13 pan with aluminum foil
and mine's going to spread
to one okay whoa
i think that's probably good maya wow i
might need to rub that around some
so we need
six cups of golden graham cereal a 10
ounce package of mini marshmallows about
a cup of mini chocolate chips we're
actually going to go stick in the
freezer in a second
and then some vanilla
um salt and five tablespoons of butter
and i hear sandy banging at the door so
let me let her out real quickly before i
get back to baking all right go outside
danny all right now we're going to spray
a big bowl with cooking spray as well
so that our marshmallows don't stick to
it
and my way you pour the graham crackers
into the bowl
that's six cups of graham crackers or
golden grahams and now we're gonna take
about one cup of the marshmallows and
we're gonna pour them in here as well so
just about one cup so i'm gonna do this
you can kind of guess
what a cup is about
i'm gonna guess that's about a cup
all right and then in our medium bombay
we're gonna put our stick of butter five
tablespoons and the rest of the
marshmallows i'm gonna pour those in for
me
the rest the whole rest of the
marshmallow okay
fall in there
[Applause]
and so now we're going to take this bowl
with the marshmallows and the butter and
we're going to stick it in the microwave
and heat it for one minute in there and
then we're going to stir it and then put
it in for another 20 seconds and stir it
again and keep going in like 20 second
intervals until the butter and the
marshmallows are all melted so let's pop
it in
all right let's get this out
and we're gonna stir it
it's kind of sticky still so it's
definitely gonna need some more time
really get that butter at the bottom
that's it
okay i think we're almost there i'm
gonna do it just one more 20 seconds i
think
a little bit better consistency
all right here we go
and we have to add a couple things to
this after i stir it
all right that looks pretty good
now we're gonna add
1 4 teaspoon of salt
and one teaspoon of vanilla
now stir it maya really well and now i'm
going to pour this
over
this cereal and marshmallow mixture and
we're going to give it a good stir
that look good maya oh
[Music]
kind of like making rice krispie treats
but they're golden graham yeah
and maya's grabbing our chocolate chips
from the freezer
all right grab a mite and we're gonna
dump that in the bowl too
all right
perfect am i gonna mix it again
all those chocolate chips can grow whoa
that's a lot of chocolate chips and we
came in the freezer that way they don't
get all too melted in here they still
kind of that was the retain some of
their shape it doesn't work
it sure does
and now we're gonna pour it into our 9
by 13 pan and just kind of try to
flatten it out as best as we can
and then we'll let it set for a little
bit and then after it's set for a while
we'll cut them into squares to take to
the party
all right i think these are gonna be
delicious
what do you think maya yummy kind of the
spoon taste
yummy it tastes yummy you like
marshmallows don't you
and chocolate
all right what'd you bring in jason i
brought you girl as a gift
figured it would be a good time for an
early christmas present for me
