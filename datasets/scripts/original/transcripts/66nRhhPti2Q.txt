hi there i'm karen from third wheel with
a video for you today on the care and
maintenance of your flute
now whenever i'm not playing my flute
and i want to put it down i either put
it down on a flute stand or i rested on
a chair
now when you rest on a chair you want to
make sure that the keys are facing up
such as this you don't want to let it
roll around so that the keys get onto
the underside so you want to make sure
the keys are up at all times and this
will keep any of them from breaking or
getting bent okay you don't want that
now when i go to put my food away i need
to clean it out every single time i put
it away i clean it out so i twist the
head joint off at the top here
and then take the cleaning rod that
comes with your instrument
and a a nice cotton or silk uh cloth
that you thread through the hole and
twist around
so that you can't see any of the rod
anymore
and then you take this and you put it
inside the head joint
put it down in your case
and then twist the body and the foot
joint apart
so that you're not crunching the keys
and clean these parts out as well
just like that
now after i've been playing and i
sometimes hear like a sticky sound in my
keys
what you can do is take something like
cleaning paper
and clean out the grime and grit that's
underneath your key
so you take a piece of this cleaning
paper and you earn insert it underneath
each key and you just gently press down
on the key you don't want to try to pull
the paper out because that could rip the
lining of your pad
so just press on the key
and that'll clean up any stickiness that
you're hearing and sometimes that
happens when the temperature in the room
that you're playing changes whether it's
really cold or
whether it's really hot
now the other thing that i do is
take my flute in to get it looked at
once a year by a repair technician so
it's really important that the keys get
oiled and that they check all the corks
to make sure that nothing's missing so
as long as you keep your flute in good
working condition it'll be that much
easier to play and you'll have a lot of
fun
see you next time
