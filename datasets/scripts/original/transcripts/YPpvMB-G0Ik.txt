it is
christmas and i'm making
a bread stopping very traditional
and very classy click on this part here
guys to see the basic white sauce i show
you how to make it in minutes and
remember the pot i had
with the water with the milk and the
onion poaching away well here is this
onion
so what we do is we just very finely
chop it
up and this got all the flavor of the
cloves and the pepper and everything so
click on that pot and you will see
exactly how to make it in minutes lump
free the correct perfect way
in we go to the pot
now you cannot make bread sauce without
bread
so what i made
is my little bread crumbs three or four
slice pan
boom in and here we
go now put about half in first of all
just to see the consistency
mix that up
and if you think it's getting too hot
just take it off for two seconds
here's my little twist on it
one teaspoon of creamed horseradish
sauce put it in just gives a little bit
of a kick
and then we put in
our pepper
now if you wanted to be very classic and
very traditional use white pepper
instead so that you don't see the flecks
of it a little bit of ground nutmeg
and again you're only talking a little
just tasters mix that in
and our last seasoning is of course
a little bit of salt
now
some people i know this is very
traditional over in america some people
might put in a little bit of the juice
from the turkey or a little bit of the
gravy that they made or even a little
bit of cream or something but that is
the most traditional basic bread sauce
taste always tastes guys
it's lovely and it goes really well with
your roast turkey at christmas
or thanksgiving day
and that is a simple bread sauce made in
minutes
because i already showed you how to make
the white sauce
