all right here we have some chicken
wings really none the little Davy
Crockett pellet grill we like to do the
chicken wings pretty hot so we first
started off on a nice low 150 smoke then
we've gone ahead and we cranked it up to
about 350 degrees here typically we're
going to go about 15 to 20 minutes a
side of your the nice and crispy and you
cannot grill chicken wings without the
GMG dry rub we put a little sizzle on
there it's got a great picture we also
put a little bit of old true rub on
there which is one of my top favorite
rubs so get yourself some today get
cooking
