hi everybody out there this is mar abaso
again with mine wrap minerals and today
we're going to kind of show you a quick
look at some of the rasm green fluorides
that come out of the Orange River
sitting in the northern Cape just
outside
cacus uh we were down there for a few
years in a row getting some of the
material that the locals were digging
from the village of
rosmont and after they dig it then we
buy it we take it into cacus we pack it
up and put it in these boxes then we
ship it over ocean Freight so we're
going to give you a look here real quick
on what the material looks like
raw before we start to work on
it so get a few of these out of the
paper
and really wrap that up
good so here's a look here as it's
coming out of the seams that they're
digging you can see some octahedron
sticking up here here's some of the
quartz this commonly associated with it
we want to try to get this cleaned up
prior to removing the quartz off of the
green
octahedrons some pieces at the locality
do come out without the C covering it
they are kind of clean but they've
encountered quite a bit of surface
etching on the
octahedrons so there's a rather large
piece you see here the bulk
fluorite here's some more of the you can
see the quartz sticking up here so
that's pretty clean quartz too once it
gets cleaned
up let's take another quick look here
see if we got any nice small ones that
have a little bit more relief
here you can see the outline of the
octahedrons mud needs to come off of
course and then depending on where
they're at digging the further down in
the deposit that they got to cleaner the
octahedrons were because the weathering
was less and less on the
pieces here you can see one of the
octahedrons hiding in this little group
of quartz here so what we' like to do
here is we're going to do a pre- clean
on these before we get them ready to do
some
waxing here's some pieces we've got set
aside where we've pre- cleaned
them we're trying to get the quartz as
clean as possible so once we
outline the shape of the piece we want
and where we want want to take off the
quartz and show the green
octahedrons once we take off the wax
then we're completely done with the
specimen so let's take a look on inside
and we'll see how they're doing on the
waxing hey everybody here's a piece that
uh we forgot to show you there just in
the earlier installment on how large the
pieces get this one came wrapped up in
its own box this is a piece out of the
deposit with crystals up to about in tip
to
tip it's pretty well completely
crystallized all the way around of
course with some areas that are going to
be better than other
areas one interesting thing about pieces
like this is I was mentioning to Elvis
our cameraman here a few minutes ago is
at the locality anytime you saw the
really white
quartz instead of this deep saturated
color up here the elements have gotten
between the quartz and the floor all
right so a lot of times at the shows
when you see the clean pieces some of
them have kind of an etched L luster or
etched faces that's because over the
Millennia that these were sitting in the
ground with the mud the elements were
working between these two whereas up
here you've got still a tight suture fit
against between the fluorite and the
quartz so this is normally when you'll
get the more transparent octahedrons in
a very smooth face so let's go ahead and
put this back and we're going to head on
inside and we're going to take a look at
the waxing process and how we outline
the pieces to end up giving you a
finished product in the
store everybody it's marcooso again
we're back with the reimos moach green
fluide octahedrons from the Orange River
and here we have some pieces like we
showed you in the back that have been
pre- cleaned they're waiting to be cut
out with the wax to kind of show what
the piece is going to look like when
it's done after we take off the quartz
from the green edrin and hopefully leave
the good quartz crystals as a contrast
so we're going to step back
here we've got uh one of our employees
here Sally Lugo from University of
Arizona if you want to say hi Sally
she's studying um journalism journalism
and photography
and you're a sophomore this year right
yeah okay great so what's happening
is Sally takes the pieces that we showed
that were slightly pre-
cleaned and then she comes in and kind
of cuts in the desired look she's
looking for she covers up the quarts she
wants to keep on the finished specimen
and then what's going to happen is is we
take off the quartz from these green
octahedrons and then hopefully we have
nice shiny green octahedrons left and
somewhat bright quartz after we take off
the
wax and at that point hopefully we have
a specimen we can settle to the public
there so after she gets done cutting
in then she goes back and
applies quite a few layers of the wax to
the piece so that way we don't damage
any of the
quartz as we're taking the quarts we
want to keep as we're taking off the
quarts we want to not
keep so she's basically making these
giant jelly beanie looking
things so that way then I can work on it
and hopefully create a specimen so what
we'll do now is we're going to back up
over here and we'll show you a few of
the pieces after we've taken off
the well I guess before we jump to where
we show you where we've taken off the
wax here's the little pieces waiting to
be worked on you can see it's pretty
thck on here that way when I get
aggressive with this stuff I'm not
damaging the parts we want to
keep so we've lumped it on there pretty
good I've done some pre-shaping down
here to get the Matrix thinned out a
little
bit so now we'll move on here and we'll
show you what everybody wants to
normally see at the show here we have
some of our finished pieces
and you can see here this is what would
have had the wax on it this is what we
wanted to keep as we were removing the
quartz from off of the green
octahedrons and uh if you were paying
attention in the first part of the
segment of this video this has kind of
the slightly etched surface so this is
some of the stuff that had the quartz
that was really white instead of the
kind of deep saturated green underneath
the
quartz there's some of
that something came out quite nice there
and then we get
um into our fantasy pieces
here this one came out particularly good
but you can see here we just kept the
quartz on the lower part give a little
bit of
accent to the octahedrons up here and
these are pretty sharp so there wasn't
much uh
wasn't much etching done on
these and this was a particularly nice
large piece
here that actually turned out to be
quite interesting because this part of
the
quartz is actually a
cast that was over a giant
octahedron and then more octahedrons
grew on top of the quartz so it's the
paragenesis in this was kind of
interesting for what was going on we
were able to keep the middle layer of
quartz this had popped off the original
OCT deedin at the locality obviously
years before cuz it's been
recrystallized so we were able to keep
that and we removed the quartz from the
octahedrons and we ended up with this
fine display piece
here which I believe at this moment is
on the we it mrap minerals. comom so
this is mar abasa once again with Elvis
Hill on the camera
there hope you enjoy your day and you've
enjoyed the segment showing the
octahedrons from rosma
