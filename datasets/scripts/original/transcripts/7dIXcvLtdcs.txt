Why are lobsters cooked alive? Well generally,
lobster meat goes bad really fast, so it's
necessary to cook the lobster while it's still
alive. Never eat a cooked lobster with its
tail uncurled because that indicates it died
before it was cooked. And it thrives in cold,
shallow waters. The reason we cook them live,
or immediately thereafter is that they release
autolytic or self-digestive fluids immediately
after death that can spoil the meat after
a very short amount of time. Live lobsters
are very perishable and require a controlled
salt water environment to remain alive. They
do not generally live much beyond a day out
of water, so we recommend that you cook your
lobsters on the day that you receive them.
Cooked lobsters will stay fresh for at least
three days in the refrigerator. Never place
lobsters in water to try to keep them alive.
The best way to keep them alive at home is
to refrigerate them. Cover your lobsters with
moist seaweed or a damp cloth to keep your
lobsters moist, and leave them in the refrigerator
until ready to cook. I'm Jan Boydstun form
