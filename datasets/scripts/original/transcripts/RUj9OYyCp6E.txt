the toilet lit at the gasket the water
went underneath the tire and went into
the wall the wall mold so uh I'm going
to install a new floor with waterproof
[Music]
[Applause]
features I want the uh High baseboard to
be flushed with the wall that's why I
remove the bottom part of the
drywall I'm going to install a thin
concrete backboard into that cut out
space that will allow me to install the
tile to be flush with the wall
now
[Music]
this is a kind of glue to help the
backboard stay on the wood St if the
nail fail at least this kind of clue
will hold in place
[Applause]
[Music]

after the baseball was install uh the
joy need to be speckled to help the joy
stay strong and no Gap can happen in the
joy

to prevent the water from entering the
wall in case it leaked underneath the
tile thisit the
waterproof um sealing apply underneath
the body bottom of the
base to hold the toilet uh strong onto
the foundation I replace a plastic uh
base ring with a metal one
[Music]
you need to Mark the floor wherever you
can find the
uneven um you can put a long ruler like
this and mark it
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
my
[Music]
[Applause]
to waterproof the backb apply this
waterproof pint onto the
backb like
this before you start tiling you need to
plan how your tile going to run for this
bathroom
I want the tile to run to the center of
the
toilet after you cut the tire put it
down again on the floor and make sure on
the position correctly fit together
before that you glue them down
I buil this uh turntable stand to help
me with a things set application onto
the tile
[Applause]
[Applause]
make sure you mark what direction the
tie is going
[Applause]
one
cut the bottom of the molding to allow
the tire to go underneath it
[Music]
[Music]
45Â° cut uh for the baseball tile you
need to do this very carefully and slow
very very slow so you don't chip the Ed
of
[Applause]
it cut on the baseball at one time and
then lay them in uh against the wall
wherever they supposed to go to make
sure you have all the pieces and they
all fit together
correctly apply waterproof sealing again
this will prevent the water from
entering the wall
for applying the baseball I use a premix
uh ceramic tie
adhesive that would make uh the job
easier to put the baseball on the wall
[Music]
[Applause]

[Music]
spe
[Music]
my tire space is very small so uh I
bought a non sandic crow that means it
can go into very small space and GAP and
I mix it with uh more water than usual I
think to keep the crout very fluidy to
help it go into very small
and then uh I grout the second time the
second time I grow I make sure that the
grow Will Go On Top of the uh the Gap
and U be in flush flat with the surface
because uh if you do the grout one time
and you clean it um you're going to have
the gr kind of sink into the Gap too
much that's why um I grouted
twice just uh plan your steps out very
well and take your time doing it because
if you rush to it and you make mistake
you'll be frustrated and you won't be
able to do the right thing so just take
your time enjoy yourself and do every
little step at uh the time good luck
