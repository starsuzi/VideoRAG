here is
a video of The Roots they're very small
but they're filling up my drain as you
can see and so what I'm going to do is
take
a main water
valve
uh tool that turns on and off the main
water out of the street and
uh
use this
to na have twist to NAB The
Roots so basically I'm just going to
start winding
this
[Music]
slowly
twisting this
thing to
uh
I don't think I want to own a house
anymore I'm tired of doing this kind of
stuff
but as long as the roots aren't too big
you can see this actually has a pretty
darn good
job and I just keep
twisting and
then pull out this
disgusting
root
mess
Jesus there we go this is what's been
clogging my
drain
