hey everybody this is your girl sweet
and sexy um
this video i was going to just do it
private but
um
one of my subscribers had asked me um
she was telling me that she has a
white sink
such as i do
um these things are kind of old my house
is
um
kind of modern but an older modern
you know
so you'll see some things in my house
like you'll probably never see
trim like this in people's kitchens and
stuff nowadays unless they're just
going for that
kind of like old-fashioned look or
something um including the tile and
stuff that i have up you you you're not
going to see all of that you know
everything else things today is modern
and they're beautiful
now
my
um
kitchen and everything that's downstairs
now that's completely modern you know i
have which i will show you guys
now my house up here my kitchen up here
i wanted that country feel that
um just make you want to just come in
and sit down and
just eat some food you know that's what
i wanted up here now downstairs
my kitchen is um
it's more modern you know i had it um
done up and i will show you guys down
there but honey i got so many boxes and
stuff
packed away and packed up down there i
still haven't unpacked and
excuse me
but my lower level
you know
it's completely moderate it's all modern
but up here is more like the country
feel anyway
yeah i just go to the left
what she wanted to know is
how
do i keep my sink clean
so what i did was i waited a while now
normally i would never let my sink go
this bad what all of that
see all of that
i would never ever let my sink get that
bad okay but i wanted to show her you
know
how it happens because obviously i can't
just make these scratches myself
you see what i'm saying
so
from like washing dishes washing
silverwares
um
doing whatever you get these scuff marks
in the sink so back in the day like a
lot of older people will probably
remember this one you know they used to
take a day once a week or something to
scour the sink scoured a tub
okay now this is what i use
the
let's see
boa me
i hope i'm pronouncing that right
yeah this is what i use
and
i'm going to show you guys how it work i
usually just
wet my sink which i've kind of wet it
earlier
and then i thought about the video i
just kind of wet the sink
with the towel
okay you know you don't need to soak it
or anything like that you know just you
just want it kind of wet
and now i'm trying to touch this foam
i don't need water in my phone
okay and then just take
some of the powder
and put it
you know
down in the sink you know or you can put
it on your towel i actually like to put
my powder on the sink
and then i just take one of my regular
now this now this dish cloth here
is an old one now they become old once
they get like certain stains or just
start to look kind of
funny to me
i i just
i don't want to go to nobody's house and
see their dish child looking nasty
okay i don't want to offend anybody
anyway
because for some reason everything i say
it's offensive to people here on youtube
you know what get the over it okay
thank you
anyway
um
just take a little bit of that i'm
trying to do it in here
and
you see probably just
right away take the scratches and stuff
off
right away
now
i don't know if you can do this with
regular um
clorox but i mean
not clorox
ajax but i'm sure you can
um
i
i just always like this one because
even um
this works good guys like on pots and
pans
and um
you know bathtubs
all that stuff too
okay so i'm trying to
do all of this so you can see
and you see once it starts getting sudsy
it
it really
don't have that same effect
to me you got to scrub a little harder
just to get a
a stain off
you know so i do go through a lot of
this because i try to use it as dry
as possible because the drier it is
the better
um
because i know she was saying that she
um
was using her um like a um
i think she said sos pads or the little
green ones i know the green ones you're
talking about because i use those
sometimes too yeah and yeah you will get
more scratches well
some people use it and be successful i
can't
you know
i find that this works better for me
and the other thing it's good for you
know is like around that
and the inner part
of your sink you know
all of that
in there
now mine here
the i have actually rubbed the um
that's not dirt that's i've actually
rubbed the um
the
the some of the steel stuff off the
paint
of that i've actually rubbed that off
because i thought it was dirt
for a long time and i was in here
and then i even got a knife you can
probably see
i even took a knife and i was scraping
it and that's when all the stuff really
came off
yeah sometime i can
go overboard with that kind of stuff
but um
i'll clean it better after i'm off of
here but i just wanted to show you that
and then
just take and
run your water
and where's the queen
and all of those marks are gone
okay
they're all gone i gotta get this y'all
but
i'm gonna have to
turn
probably use my other hand and i'm
trying not to drop my foam in here
okay
but as you can see
that's that's all it takes and your sink
is
nice and clean clear
okay
and yeah that's what i use when you turn
that water off and out here
but that's all that i use
and um
makes it so nice and clean and
and all of that
and i usually try to do that
i want to tell y'all the truth as soon
as i see a scratch in my sink
yeah i take it out
i just don't like anything dirty and
nasty and
with filth and grime and
ugh i just i i can't
it just reminds me
of just nastiness
okay so i hope this has helped you
let me know and to anybody else who did
watch this video and it was helpful to
you thank you for watching
and i'll be back to show you guys
um
maybe i'll come back and show y'all what
i'm having for breakfast i'll even cook
with y'all how about that okay
take care bye
