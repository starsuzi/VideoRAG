well I was going to fix a couple Frozen
pot
pies and I want to use my toaster oven
but it says on there on the box and very
plain L language do not use in toaster
ovens
so being the kind of person who uh
doesn't take instructions too well
anyway and I don't ask why I ask why
not and after a bunch of research I
finally found what I think are some of
the answers and I've been
fixing pot pies in a toaster
oven ever since and it works very
well now the story
is I'll show you
here
why you can't use a
toast if you look up there in the top
you see how close the heating heating
elements are to the bottom but if you go
over to a main big oven the heating
elements are all in the bottom and the
heat goes around
it and what will
happen in a toaster oven is it toasts it
instead of baking
it so I've worked out a way
to make that work without burning up the
pot
pies the first thing you want to do is
set it on bake and
400 and
preheat
and it says to Slit the tops of the
pies that's to put vents in
it okay that's
done and you want to make a tin out of
aluminum foil and put over the top of
them and that'll keep that direct heat
off the top of the pie now I used a
double layer of aluminum foil here and
uh I didn't press it together or
anything to give it a little air space
in
between and we're going to go from this
as soon as the oven is hot
okay I've put the tinted pan with the my
with the pot pies in there and it says
bake 32 to 34
minutes so I'll set the timer on
it so I think I'll set this for just a
little over 30
minutes and see how it comes
out well it's
been 35 minutes now let's look at
it oh yeah they look nice and brown like
they do in the
picture and it says let's set for
5 minutes to finish
cooking and then check the temperature
I'll do
that well
I check the temperature and the top
crust is not flaky it's still a little
soft so I'm going to close the oven
up
and give it about another 5 minutes
without the ttin on it to crisp up the
tops
[Music]
okay that's
another 7 minutes with the tent
off and I've been kind of watching them
on the
color and the color is
now about the same as it is on
the on the Box on on the
illustration and let's check the
temperature
now yeah there it went to 180째 so it's
they say anything above 165 is
cooked
I check the temperature and it is up and
I'm going to let them rest for 5 minutes
now okay let's compare the color of the
illustration to the Finish pie and it
looks about the
same
yeah and the temperature
is going up and up and
up and it's been setting
for 5 minutes out of the oven and the
temperature is still at
155째 so that's hot enough okay here's
the drill on it the box says 32 to 35
minutes at 400째 in the oven you ttin it
and cook it 30 minutes with the tent on
remove the tent and cook it for another
8 to 10 minutes kind of watching it to
see that it doesn't get too Brown
and uh then take it out and let it set
for 5 minutes and you can check the
temperature and if you want to with a
thermometer and it runs all 155 to
165째 so you can now fix
your Frozen pot pies in a toaster
oven
