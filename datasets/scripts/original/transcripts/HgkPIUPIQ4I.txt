hi everyone it's Tara um I was asked to
do um a resin tutorial I showed um a
couple of my resin pieces in a a video
and uh a couple people asked me to do a
resin tutorial so I am going to try to
do this um I don't have any video
editing software so um yeah so I'm going
to try and and make this as easy as
possible okay so the first thing you're
going to need is the resin and this is
the resin that I use it is easy cast I
got this at Michaels it costs about $14
and I use a 50% off coupon so um yeah if
you have a coupon I would definitely use
it cuz this can be kind of pricey so
this is what it
is and then in this box you get two
bottles and one is the resin and one is
the
hardener and I hope you can see
that okay and then what you're going to
do is you're going to measure out equal
parts of each one of these so I have a
little medicine cup that I
use and I just fill it to um whatever
however much I want um and so I put in
this case I filled it up to the line
that says two um so I poured in two of
the resin and I poured in two of the
hardener and then with that I took this
cup and then poured it into a bigger cup
okay so I already
preidis of the video and then you're
going to just mix it all together and
you're going to mix it for about 2
minutes
so mix mix mix you can always you can
always uh just mix it in this too um
so so just mix it all together
and a lot of the videos that I've seen
they say to mix it slowly because you'll
get bubbles and I am getting Bubbles and
I'm sure the camera is probably not even
picking that
up but um it doesn't matter cuz I find
that once I pour it into the
mold uh the bubbles kind of uh
dissipate and I don't really see them
after I add all of my you know whatever
I'm putting into the mold so
I think this has been about 2 minutes so
I'm going to go ahead and show
you um what I do after I finish doing
this um yeah okay so I'm going to use
this mold here and this mold I got
online uh at a place called resin
Obsession excuse me um but there's many
um manufacturers or there's a lot of
people on Etsy that sell um different
different kinds of molds and stuff so
anyway I just picked this this one up
and I also got this one at Hobby Lobby
which I haven't used yet I don't know if
you can even see I haven't used this one
yet but I
will okay so for today I'm just going to
use this
mold
and once it's all mixed
together I'm just going to pour it into
the mold so I'm going to use this
one and I don't fill it all the way up
because I find that once I start adding
stuff it um it might like spill
over I'm going to use this one
and I think I'm going to use this heart
mold
too so I didn't mix up a lot of resin
cuz I wasn't planning on doing a lot of
pieces
um let's
see
and this is going to be a two-part video
because the resin has to cure
about um 24 12 to 24 hours I usually let
it sit
overnight and that way I know it's
done um so yeah I think that's
good all
right so I hope you can see what I did
and
now I'm going to fill my pieces so for
this one
here for this one here I'm going to add
a little uh dress
charm so I'm going to add that right
into this mold
here and
I usually let it sit about an hour
before I add the glitter because I don't
want the glitter to fall all the way to
the bottom of the
piece and let's see for this
one I'm going to I wanted to make one
with my daughter's name so I'm going to
use these
um these pieces
here and you can get these at any craft
store they're just like the the letter
beads so let's see these can be tricky
because
um if you look at it this way it when it
goes into the mold it's like the
opposite it's like upside down so you
have
to put it in upside
down like that's the a I hope you can
see it but that's the A and I put it on
this pin just to help me um place it
better but so when I when I'm looking at
it like this then I know when it goes
into the mold it's going to be the right
way so I'm going to place this a
here and
then we have the
M I'm just going to place that one
there another
a let's
see okay
there then I
easy
okay so that's I'm just going to push
that down to
the the resin straighten out my
letters
make sure they're the way that I like
them
okay and then for this one I'm not going
to uh wait an hour cuz I'm just going to
add sprinkles over top I'm going to do
another one for my daughter real quick
here
so this for my youngest
daughter you know you can't do one
without doing the
other
okay this is like really easy to
do um and they're a lot of fun and they
make really great pieces my daughters
love wearing the
jewelry um I wear some of the pieces to
work and all the women that I work with
work with uh just like went
crazy so but these are really easy to do
they make great gifts um and as you can
see you can personalize it any way you
want um I've seen a lot of resin
tutorials here on YouTube a lot of
people add stickers and glitter and
stuff like that um but I kind of like a
more sophisticated look I guess
so I I haven't used any stickers
yet okay so that looks
good and I hope you guys can see what
I'm doing
here all
right um and then let's see I have
another piece here I'm going to use this
spider
charm to make a necklace
so actually you know what I'm not I am
going to use some
M&M's in uh these I'm going to use it in
this one so I just uh got some mini
M&M's here see if I can zoom
in okay so I just got some U mini
M&M's and I'm just going to place them
inside of this mold
here and and I just place them
randomly but I want the m to show of
course so I have to manipulate the the
candy and I'm just trying to find really
good
pieces the candy here
oops for yellow okay here's a yellow
one drop that
in see do another Green
Piece
and again I'm just going
to move the candy around till it's in a
place that I like
it
okay let's do another red piece up
here and maybe another yellow
piece there okay
and um these are really I love you
trying different types of candies the
M&M minis work really good I tried it
with uh gummy bears and I don't know if
it's it was because of a it was a cheap
brand of gummy bears or what but it
didn't uh it didn't come out too well so
I might try the gummy bears again if I
can find maybe some smaller Gummy Bears
or
something okay okay so that's the M&M's
one and
then hope you guys could see what I did
there um okay so I just have some
sprinkles here and you can use any kind
of sprinkles again like I said you can
use whatever you
want um so for these I'm just going to
sprinkle the sprinkles right in because
I don't really mind if it gets in
between the letters I think that's going
to look
cute
and I'm just putting my finger here so
the sprinkles don't fly over to the next
piece
okay
fill it a little bit more with the
sprinkles
okay okay that should be
good and um Okay so then I have these
two heart pieces that I or these heart
molds that I filled with the
resin
and what am I going to put in there
let's see I want to do something a
little different but I don't want it to
flow over so I have this little uh
slider Buckle here with a pink flatback
pearl and I think I'm going to put
it inside of this heart piece here see
how that comes out and then once this
sits for about an
hour I am going to
add uh some light pink
glitter and I'm just I put the uh the
slider Buckle in I'm just kind of taking
the skewer
and bringing over some of the resin so
it covers the piece in the
back
okay okay that looks pretty
good so I'm going to leave that like
that okay and then I really want to use
this spider
charm so what I'm going to
do
is I'm just going to drop this spider
charm in
here
I'm just going to drop that
in and then again I'm going to wait well
actually for this one I really I don't
know know if I need to wait an
hour I think I
better
okay all right so that's basically it um
for this one I'm going to wait
about an hour before I put the glitter
on because I don't want the glitter to
sink to the
bottom
and uh again you just wait uh 24 hours
until it's done and you pop them out and
I will come back tomorrow and show you
what the finished pieces look like okay
um but right now I'm going to show you
some that I've already done so this is
one of this is the spider I use that
spider charm see and I use like a a I
guess it's kind of like a gunmetal type
of
glitter and you can't really see the
spider so that's why I wanted to redo
this one and I'm going to use like an
orange
color um glitter so hopefully it will
pop the spider will pop out and you can
see it but this one's still cute and I
just add a little bail to the back for a
necklace here's a ring that I did and
again I used this the M&M's the mini
M&M's and I used um
Brown glitter behind
that here's a piece that I did where I
added the
charms I add a mermaid charm and a fish
charm and I just varied the Glitters in
the
back okay this one I really love this
one this was a peppermint and I just
dropped it into the mold I I use this
mold the bigger one here
and waited about an hour and added some
red glitter to the back and as you can
see the peppermint piece was bigger than
the
mold but that's okay because this is
going to lay against uh you know your
chest or if you make a ring you're not
even going to see it but I love this
piece I thought that was really
fun um here's a couple more little rings
that I
did
the
M&M's
um and then this one I just used some
Halloween colored uh glitter I'm sorry
sprinkles and made a ring out of
that okay so so that's it so I'm going
to let these set overnight and I'm going
to come back with a video tomorrow and I
will show you how uh they all turn out
so thanks for watching guys
bye
