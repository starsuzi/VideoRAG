- All right, Logangsters.
Last one of you to take your hand off
this house gets to keep it.
- I live with my parents.
- My mom's kicking me out.
- I already parked my car in the driveway.
- I just want a house.
- I don't need this, but I'm gonna win it,
so they can't have it.
- Dude, you should let one of them win it.
- No.
- Rules are simple, boys.
Last one of you to take
your hand off the house,
or sit down, loses.
Before we can go too far,
we need to show you guys
the inside of the house.
So, make your way inside
while keeping your hands on the wall.
We're gonna show the viewers the inside.
- So guys, what do you
think of the living room?
- Looks like a good place to live.
- Spacious.
- And room in.
- This is the first room right here.
♪ Do bi do bi do bop ♪
Guys, come over here.
This is room number two.
Oh, yeah. By the way guys,
Bailey's one of our editors.
- Hello?
- You guys haven't really met him before
but now you have him.
- My guest appearance.
- This is room number three.
Wait, and then you guys
have this spot over here.
- You're upstairs living room
to oversee your downstairs.
- Spacious.
- And then there's a bathroom over here.
All right, let's go back outside.
That's your tour.
- All right, they are now complying
to these two strips to tape.
- somebody bring a fly, so Jake can lose.
- Calm down, boys.
- Somebody put the hood
up, so Taylor can lose.
- Somebody start a challenge.
so Taylor can quit.
- Okay.
- So, let's go over the rules
so we're all on the same page.
No sitting, hand must stay
on, you can't switch hands.
One hand. This camera
is recording everything.
Last one of you to take it off,
gets to live here for one year.
- Wait, take it off?
- Rent free.
- Take it off now.
- Last one to take
your hand off.
- Oh.
- Gets to live in this house
for one year with no rent.
Now, this challenge is
gonna be a little different
than other ones.
We're gonna screw around
with you guys a lot.
Just so you know.
One thing we're doing a little different
about this challenge is we're
punishing people if they lose.
There's five of them.
Whoever's the last man
standing wins the house.
The other four, when they quit,
they're gonna get hit with
whipped cream in the face,
or gonna egg them.
Not only is the house on the
line, but so is embarrassment.
It should be fun.
- So, Garrett. Why do you need this house?
- Well, because I like
to walk around naked
and I have too many roommates at the time.
- Why do you need this house?
- So, I can get away from my parents.
It's time to move outta my own.
I'm a butterfly now.
- So, Jake. Why do you need this house?
- Send it out.
- Because it's getting really
awkward bringing home girls
to mom and dad, and
I'm 26, living at home.
- All right. Then Jake,
you better not take your
hand out that house.
Bailey, how about you?
- I just moved here and I
don't have a place to stay.
- That's true.
He literally moved down
here to edit for me
and does the apartment.
- I've been living in
his apartment, so I need-
- So, Bailey wants to
move outta my apartment
into this house.
- into this place.
- It's another-
- Another your apartment.
- Oh.
- Put in an a-hole and let them win.
Also, reveal your hand.
That's the second time
I've had to warn you.
Last thing I need your phone.
- Can I keep my phone
- Thank you.
for insurance purposes?
- Give me your phone.
Haven't saved in your contacts?
- No.
- All right, Chandler.
Thank you for your phone.
Can I have your phone?
- I have a flip phone.
- I thought all day was-
- Well, can I have your flip phone?
- Hold up. Today's Thursday?
- And there we go.
We have all the phones.
All right, guys. Now we have a Nerf gun.
Let's shoot him.
- That actually kinda hurts.
- Let's see if I can hit
him from across the street.
- That is so close.
- He's on the line.
- We need an instant replay.
- You see where I clip
the line right here?
Or something like that.
- Garret, come here. Here you go.
- Didn't see anything.
- Are you sure?
- you guys.
- That's not real.
- Reload me.
- You guys duck before?
- I got you, dude.
- They're saying my lap is open for anyone
who wants to come sit
down. It's very Comfy.
- Give me the house, now.
- you don't have to do this.
- Give me the house
- Put the gun down.
- Taylor, put the gun down.
- I think it made in my hoodie.
- What? Oh.
- I didn't do it. Go have it. Go have it.
- Chandler deserves a
punishment. Punish him.
- Since Chandler shot me,
he gets hit with a potato.
I'm gonna grab an egg, so he's gonna think
I'm gonna throw an egg,
and then when he like turns to hide,
I'm gonna pelt him with a potato.
He's gonna be freaking
out when I throw it.
And then they'll leave.
All right, you guys might want
to get away from Chandler.
Chandler in the middle.
- This is my good clothes.
- Chandler.
- Is there egg in your pocket,
or are you just happy to throw stuff?
- That's a whole cut of potato.
- Ouch.
- That was your punishment.
- That potato looks like a rock.
- Well, you just got spudded.
- Peace, dude.
- Is that potato or a balls there?
- Is that frozen or something?
- Maybe you can hit the potato a minute.
Oh, that was close.
- That was real close.
Can I get another try?
- I'll hit it with my poison dart.
- Can I get another try?
If you go again,
and you hit it, you can pelt someone,
and if you miss, then I
will throw these egg at you.
- All right.
- Yeah. Something fishy's up
- The second that you missed it,
I'm throwing these egg at you.
- Okay.
- One second.
- Betrayal, betrayal.
- I got it.
- He's got an egg, everybody get down.
- Back off.
- And while he has an egg,
I'm staying over here.
- Here's the potato man.
- Garrett's butt is egg proof confirmed.
- Should I just hold onto it?
Oh, look.
I really just wanna throw
it way up in the air
and see it splatter.
- Imma try those.
- Do it, watch yourself.
- I spared all your lives.
♪ Like we said ♪
♪ Just like a Christmas tree ♪
♪ Aah ♪
- Imagine these guys robbing your house.
♪ Carol ♪
- Hey, you're not supposed
to be having fun, guys.
- Potato.
- Here's a potato to throw it to someone.
- Jake did that on purpose.
- I did not.
- You guys still wanna
do the survivor thing?
- Oh, yeah.
- Do the corner. Now, you're isolated.
Who would you vote off?
- Chandler.
- Right. Go over there.
Chandler. Would you vote off?
- Jake.
- Okay, all right. Bailey, we need you.
- Probably Chris.
- So far, everyone has one vote.
No one has two.
- I don't wanna vote anybody
off 'cause I love everyone.
- Go vote.
- Chandler.
- All right, Chris.
You're the final vote on Live Island.
This is to wrap up Live Island.
- Chandler.
- Oh, wow. Chandler, you got three votes.
- What? You guys really
just don't like me?
- Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- What time is it?
- 2:37.
- I have to go to this
doctor's appointment.
So, see you guys.
- Whoa.
- I thought he was kidding.
- He actually has a doctor's
appointment at 1:30.
All right, Chris, how does
it feel to be off the wall?
- It feels good,
if only I didn't have
a doctor's appointment.
- All right, cool. Come over here.
Who do you want to pie you?
- Bailey.
- All right, Bailey. You pie him.
- Oh, this is like Milky.
All right. What won't
ruin your day as much?
- It's right in the nose, man.
Just don't hit me too hard.
- All right. There you go, Chris.
You're done for the day.
- I'm sorry, man.
- How do you guys feel that Chris is out?
- I was surprised. I'm actually,
I don't know what to
do in my life anymore.
'cause he was my entertainment.
- I was shocked.
- I'm still here.
- But he's still here, that's true.
- I didn't know what time it was.
- He's not here
- My doctor's appointment
at 1:30, it's 11:00.
- I'm just relieved that he's gone.
'Cause now this makes easy for me.
- Chandler, you're not the first one gone.
- I know.
- All right, guys. It is time for lunch.
No one's gonna know who gets who's food.
So, this is gonna be 100% anonymous.
You're gonna pick Jake's food.
What do you wanna give him?
- I wanna get him a tofu sandwich.
That way he gets no food.
- I guess we'll do Chandler next.
Chandler, you get to pick
Bailey. What is Bailey?
- I want a McDouble,
with just mustard, and
ketchup, and bun. That's it.
- All right, Bailey. Your turn to pick.
You're doing Chandler, yeah.
- Just do a spicy chicken sandwich
with extra pickles.
- Spicy chicken sandwich
- Yeah.
- That's beautiful.
You're picking for Garrett.
- For Garret?
- Yeah.
- You can get a footlong
from Subway, right?
- Yeah, why?
- With just wheat, right?
- Yeah.
- With Pepper Jack cheese.
- That's it?
- That's it.
- You guys were all pretty ruthless.
No one knows who orders for who.
- Bailey, I got you a large fries.
- Yes. All right.
- All right. You guys cannot
reach out for the line.
No one's allowed to touch
each other for the meal time.
- All right. Is this Bailey's?
- This is Bailey's. So,
Chandler picked your food.
- Wow. These are super cold. I love them.
- Yeah.
- Here's your sandwich.
- So, here we have a wheat bun
piece of cheese, two
tomatoes, and lettuce,
and another wheat bun.
- This is not what I ordered.
- I'm not upset.
- So, for Garrett.
- Here's your Subway sandwich.
- Is just bread? That's
what it feels like.
- That's actually not bad.
- Yeah. I'll eat that. Thank you.
- How does that bread
look like it was handled by
everyone who works there?
- All right.
This is what Garrett got you. Enjoy it.
- How do you like your tofu sandwich?
- Is there any tofu in it?
- Can I get a bite?
- It's really spicy. I
mean, it's really spicy.
- Who picked Chandler's food?
Was that Bailey? Bailey
pick your food. Here you go.
- Stop. It says extra pickles on it.
Oh, I'm not eating this today.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Peel the bun off.
- Why not?
- Hmm. you smell those pickles?
- Chandler, would you rather starve
or have some pickle?
- Starve.
- Can I eat one?
- All right. Well, Chandler
doesn't want his food.
- Chandler, how do you feel about this?
- I hate pickles with a
passion. I'm scared of them.
- Oh my gosh, do it.
- No, please. Please.
- Stop.
Get away from me.
- Why are you so afraid to pickles?
- You're lucky he-
- No, camera didn't see it.
- Let me see if it's got a shot.
Yeah, it does.
- Chandler, you took your hand off.
- What do you mean?
- The pickle ended over here.
- I didn't saw it. And then I freaked out.
- Did you take your hand off the wall?
- Yeah.
- Come over here. Hold up, hold up.
Don't go too far.
- Chandler!
- All right, Garrett, you can pie him.
You know, I wanna take your hoodie off.
- Take the hoodie off.
- Well that happened, so whatever.
- Let it go.
- Three, two, one.
- All right, all right.
- I can't see.
- And now,
Chandler is officially
out. You fought hard.
- All right. So, there's a window
directly above the guys,
and Chandler wants to get
a little bit of revenge.
So, he's gonna dump all the
trash and some eggs on him
through the window and
they won't expect it.
- More of your eggs.
- Stop throwing it on our house.
- None of them are broken.
- Y'all had one jaw.
- I mean, if I throw it at
it might break. Oh, no.
- Sorry, guys. I tricked you. Oh, no.
Oh, no.
- Oh, God.
- What's that?
- Hundreds of dollars.
Whoever touches it can have it.
It's gonna sit right under this.
- All right.
- Oh.
- There is it.
- Peace.
- Wow.
- Good game.
- Good game.
- Congrats, buddy.
- I was about to go for
it too using the broom.
- Well, you still get pied.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm gonna defer and let Chandler do it.
- Okay.
- Leaning tower of-
- Hit me.
- Shoes.
- Don't get it on his shoes.
It all went right here.
- And Garrett is officially done.
- Give me the post game
interview real quick.
I saw the cash and I got
greedy. I wanted to get out.
Think we did all right there.
- You need lunch?
- Here, grab it off my face.
- All right. So-
- It's just us too.
- Yeah. What do you think?
- It's a three bedroom, right?
- Yeah.
- What if we both at the exactly time
- Wait, are you I'm making a deal.
- Just stop.
- Yeah. We're making a deal, dude.
- I already waited out here
and I... You're just gonna
make a deal like that?
- You want the money.
- Go away. You guys left.
- That's three.
- You're done.
- Let me live. Let we live.
- Go away, go away.
- We eat pickles on a regular basis.
- Yeah. So, if we both take our hand off
at the exact same time right
now, we can take this place.
There's three bedrooms.
- True.
- You guys you're offering
to just split it with each other
instead of winner takes it all?
- And it's also raining and
we don't wanna be out here.
- All right. Well shake on it
with your non-hand-hands.
- Wait, hold on. Before they shake,
can we point out some obvious?
This is Bailey's first
challenge and he's gonna win
- And Bailey's getting a dub
on his first challenge.
- Chandler.
- It's all right. Come back, Chandler.
It's all right, it's all
right. Hold me, it's all right.
- Back to the negotiation now,
that is to be pointed out.
- All right. So, then count down
and both take your
hands off, and share it.
I mean you guys do what you want.
- Three, two, one. Go.
- I'm sorry.
- So, you are splitting it though.
- Yeah.
- Cause you did win.
- We're gonna split it either way.
- Okay, okay.
- I'm sorry.
- Jake lost.
- I got you.
- I thought he was
gonna do the same thing,
and it was gonna be like
just a tie for the whatever.
- All right, Jake Paulers.
These are the keys to the house,
Front, back door, and everything.
We're gonna help you guys move in.
You won. So, Bailey claimed this room,
and Jake claimed both
of the rooms upstairs.
All right, let's move you guys in.
- Ouch.
- It's too cold outside to be doing that.
- Hey, Jake. So, where
are we at right now?
- We're at my parents' house where I stay.
We're gonna get my stuff ready to pack-up.
'Cause we did beat the U-Haul here.
But once it's here, we're gonna load it up
and gonna get going.
- All right.
So, this is where Bailey's
been living my old apartment.
Yeah. So, show us what you got.
- So, this is temporary.
So, I kind of had a lot of
my stuff already packed, but-
- 'Cause you know, he
moved here to edit for me,
and he hasn't really
been here too, too, long.
Wow. You're gonna be easy to move.
- Yes.
- All right. So, let's move it over.
- Let's do this.
All right. So, we've got to pack
all this up. Shouldn't be too hard.
- It's your big day, man.
- Big time.
- You won.
- The first ever box going into my room.
- Chandler, be nice.
- I'm not helping.
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's weird. It's like a hobbit hole.
- Whoa.
- That's pretty cool.
- Holy crap
- There's a light back there.
- Are you kidding me? Since you lost,
you could just live right here.
- That's his cabin when he comes over.
- You can stop. You're good.
- My door.
- Help us, help us. Push it. Help.
- When Jake yells, it scares me.
- Bailey, your roommate is a Viking.
- Yes.
- How does that feel?
- It's scary, but I feel protected.
You know? I feel safe. Aah.
- Sorry.
- Do you feel safe now
with Garret coming around?
- All right guys, it's
been a very long day,
but you guys won the challenge.
So, here's your keys.
They both wanted to live
together. So, there you go.
We moved them in a little bit.
They're still missing some
things and say whatever.
- Thank you, MrBeast
for the house. And then-
- Oh, my name's MrBeast, not Jimmy.
- Who's Jimmy? Thanks, Jim Beast
for letting us participate-
- That's pretty fun. I like it.
- Can y'all leave now? Okay.
- Wait, wait, actually hold up.
While you guys are there, can you model
in front of your new house with the merch?
If you guys buy these hoodies, right.
At shopmrbeast.com, that's really sexy,
I can give more people houses.
- It's true.
Wait, where's your key? You have one.
- No, I left it inside.
Let me see it real quick.
- There's one right there.
- Let me just see it real
quick. It's been in my head. Bye
- Oh.
- Jake, be nice.
- I-
- Bye.
- By doing that,
everyone will see your door number.
♪ Mr. Beast, oh ♪
♪ Mr. Beast, oh ♪
- All right guys, we have this Nerf gun.
If you catch the bullet,
you will get a prize, okay? And go.
- You ready?
- Oh, you got it.
He got it.
- All right. You have two options.
Okay, you have two options.
- Okay.
- It's gonna be a lot of cash.
- Okay.
- All right. You either
split it with somebody,
or you keep the whole
thing and you walk away.
- Wait, you walk away?
- No way. I mean, no question. I split it.
- Okay. Well, I'm gonna need you guys
to figure out who you're
gonna split it with.
- All right, here you go over there.
So, he's saying that
if I split it with him,
he'll walk away right now.
- Who? Garret?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Keep that in mind.
- What's happening?
- You listen?
- Yes, 'cause you're not very quiet.
