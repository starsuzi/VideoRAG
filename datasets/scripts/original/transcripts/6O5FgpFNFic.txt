This is Yolanda from vanveenbulbs.com. In
this segment we're going to talk about how
to plant day lilies in mulch. Now what is
mulch? How do I plant things in it? Well,
basically mulch is any organic material that
you collect from your yard and throw in to
your compost pile. And when it's still fluffy
and it hasn't gone down in to compost and
actually look like earth and dirt, it's considered
mulch. So I a bed here of compost that's got
saw dust, grass clippings, leaves in it, soil
in it, everything and it's breaking down.
But I found that plants grow wonderfully in
my mulch. And if I have plants or bulbs that
I don't think are looking alive, I'll throw
them in my compost pile and they will grow
in the mulch so easily. This day lily right
is really easy to grow anywhere. I got some
soil with it as well so even when you're planting
in mulch, I try to put a few handfuls or at
least some potting soil or H compost in with
it's something to really grab on to. But you
can always start new flower beds so quickly
and easily by planting things right in to
the mulch. So just save some grass clippings
and your leaves in the fall, mix them all
up and put them in a corner in your yard.
And you will find in no time, it will turn
in to soil. And even before it turns in to
soil, while it's still mulch, I can plant
this day lily right in to this. And right
underneath is just beautiful soil, it's just
beautiful soil. This is last year's compost.
So it's the grass clippings and everything
else. So underneath I have beautiful soil
and it's breaking down very quickly. And I'm
just going to put this day lily right in to
this mulch in the fall and by next spring
it'll die back down. The mulch will be down
in to good soil and by next summer I'll have
a huge clump of day lilies.
