J moio Marsh right here this is going to
be a series on how you can remove the
stump the easy way and the fun way
regretfully it's not the quick way but
it can be fun and
entertaining so uh follow along with me
in this series I'll show you how to take
a stump like
that and reduce it to something like
that and just a few easy steps again
it's not the quick way if you want the
quick way then hire a stump grinder cost
you 700 bucks this won't cost you much
but it will cost you some time this
particular stump is an
ash and the the Ash boore has devastated
all the ash trees here in Ohio what a
tragedy this this tree's got to be over
a 100 maybe 200 years old but anyhow
what I like to do and just try to mark
it
off in eight
quadrants you know I to be
exact then for each
quadrant I start drilling a a series of
holes
I had changed real bit the other
one was pretty
dull but try go as deep as you
can those as deep as you can go then
I've got this marked off about eight
quadrants trying to space your hose out
maybe four or 6 Ines apart
now you might be saying Marsh rat that
does not look like fun but guess what
the battery pack is dead on my
drill so I'm going to take a
break while that battery pack recharge
and uh have a little fun while that
battery PS recharging so it could be fun
it's just all a matter of
attitude but got all my holes
drilled and I did notice that uh toward
the bottom of each hole it was a little
bit damp so uh this tree was cut last
September it's now April so it needs to
look dry out a bit more do not try this
on a green stump but anyhow the next
step is we're going to fill each hole
with some vegetable oil you could use
motor oil but it's not recommended cuz
we're going to eventually burn this
stump and um motor o is not really that
cool for an environment and it's
something definitely you don't want to
um to do I'm going to fill each
hole this vegetable oil and I'm going to
let it soak for a long
time probably a month or so I don't
know so just fill each hole
well thanks for
watching and uh stay
tuned for the next part of this series
but it'll be a while it'll be a month or
so before I put the next one out in this
series cuz I want this to to soak and I
may um Let It soak in there and come
back and add more uh vegetable
oil thanks for
watching cheer from Ohio Marsh rat over
and out
