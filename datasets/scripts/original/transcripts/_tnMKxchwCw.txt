welcome to the poor man's Gourmet
Kitchen where we share Gourmet recipes
at a lowbudget Wonder now check this out
here I've got about a 3 lb duck that's
completely rinsed off inside and out I
prepare it starting with the wings and I
fold each one of them
back and as you can see here it tightens
up the bird and makes it more uniform
and here is the flap of the neck just
want to fold that
underneath now to season the bird we're
going to use some kosher salt and some
[Music]
sage and once you've got this all mixed
together we're going to add that to the
cavity of the
duck now to avoid making a mess you want
to close both ends of the Ducks as you
rotate back and forth to ensure that the
entire cavity gets covered in
seasoning and once it looks something
like this you want to start adding some
more aromatic flavors like this garlic
here smash that to release its flavor
and go ahead and add that to the cavity
as
well now a couple sprigs of fresh
Rosemary as
well and last but not least an entire
bunch of green onion should fill the
rest of that
[Music]
cavity now with the metal rod you can
stick it in the end
here and sew up the
cavity and there's really nothing to it
you just go in and out over the top in
and out over the top and
out like so
now it's time to give it a bath I just
stick it on a wire rack over a bowl and
here I've got some boiling hot
water just add a ladle at a time right
over the top of that bird it'll help
disinfect and tighten up that skin over
the entire duck watch the ne
shrink see now there's no doubt that
this doesn't tighten up the skin of the
bird and once you finish that you can
transfer it to your baking
dish now to season the outside I want to
start with some vinegar and some
honey I just give it a quick whisk with
a basting brush and coat the entire
outside of this
bird now in all honesty if this is all I
did to the outside of this bird it would
be enough it give it a nice golden color
and a nice sweet taste after it's
baked but I'm going to go ahead and make
an additional quick rub with this kosher
salt and smoked
pepra then just spread it evenly across
the entire top of this
[Music]
bird as you can see that'll give us a
nice sweet salty Smoky Paprika
taste and at this point you can either
marinate it or take it straight to your
oven and bake this at
350Â° for about an hour and a half and
when it's done it'll look like
this see that salt gives it a nice
Crispy Crunchy
outside I always start my portions with
the breast
meat and if you want to know how to
carve a bird I've actually got a video
on that tutorial as well I can include
in the description
below but once you get this smoothly cut
you have a portion that looks something
like
this now a lot of times when you buy a
packaged duck it comes with this orange
sauce already pre-made so all you got to
do is just heat it on the stove and as
you can see I just laid a lid on the
plate now breast portions are easier to
cut flipped upside down that way you cut
through the skin pretty
smoothly then all you got to do is flip
it over
right side
up and then you can just lay it right in
on the
plate followed by a leg
portion and if you want to quickly chop
some green
onion you can drop that right over the
top and there you have it roast duck
