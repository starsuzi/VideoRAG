when you're ready to come in to do your
floor chols for the job good mask this
is a
P3
gloves roller old Emulsion
roller so you know that's good enough
for the
job paint pot and some thinners this
stuff needs thinning out for its first
coat also we roller pole I'm going
to you can use a normal roller pole but
best idea is just tap the plastic end
off and get yourself a
thread threaded
um
roller um and and then it won't drop off
on you when you're working away it's a
good thing you can take the other ones
on if you
want um and obviously a tray so SP in
this stuff first
coat this has been stirred
up I need to empty some out of
this for
take
finners this case this is white
spirit and I thing this off quite a bit
again it's first
cat just start gently
lifting It Up From The Bottom literally
lifting it
up Let It
Drop drawing the T white Spirit down
lifting the
heavier sediment to the top
get in
there I could probably thin it off a
little bit more
but this has already been sealed the
floor
so much happy with that pop into one
side
and just gently
lift from the
bottom to the top
that's it ready to go
there stick gloves on first
so first of all load the
trail probably get a bigger trade than
this
you're not using
it don't just sit it on put it
on going to load the roller Violet
here make sure
it's loaded for l
keeping me workday
here I'm going to be able to work from
the far Corner taking that wall working
this way and keeping me exit ready for
going and obviously it's raining outside
so I can't um put my workstation outside
so I've got to have it here and so best
near the exit so you're not moving stuff
around too much so yeah fire
corner so when you cut in your corners
make sure you bring it good distance
away just makes it easier for when
you're
rolling and then against this brck work
here just flooded it into the
edge so it just makes it a bit
neater and just loading it
on push it out to the edge
[Music]
this is full oil remember it will just
go go for quite a bit so don't start too
close to the
edge
it working
[Music]
so first coat's on the
now I'll leave that to dry off now till
tomorrow probably more than 24 hours
when I have to leave
it um the only thing to do now is to put
my roller in a plastic bag and then pop
it in a booket of water for the night
just uh ready to use again tomorrow cuz
I when I finish this Flor I don't think
I'll be using it again that'll just get
Bend
