How to Make Wine Glass Charms.
Tired of hearing, "Is that my glass?"
at gatherings?
End the confusion by creating simple charms
that will help everyone hang on to their own
drink.
You will need Wine glasses A cylinder about
1/2' in diameter Beads, charms, or poster
paper and stickers Memory wire A heavy-duty
wire cutter or memory-wire shears Needle-nose
pliers A hole-punch A drill and small drill
bit.
Step 1.
Choose ornaments for your glasses; craft stores
and jewelry-making web sites offer a variety
of beads and charms.
Or, cut 2-inch by 1/2-inch strips of poster
paper, punch a hole in each, and personalize
them with guests’ names, stickers, or festive
sayings.
If you have a drill with a small bit, consider
making your own charms out of old board-game
pieces.
Step 2.
Using a wire cutter, trim the memory wire,
available online and at craft stores, into
approximately 3/4-inch to 1-inch long pieces.
You can use plain wire hoop earrings instead
of memory wire.
Just bend the straight end of the wire around
the stem.
Step 3.
Form them into hoops by wrapping them around
a cylindrical object a little larger than
the size you want the charm to be.
Leave 1/4-inch of extra wire on each end,
which you’ll use later to form a clasp.
Step 4.
Personalize each hoop by stringing a charm,
bead, or tag onto it.
Or fill an entire hoop with small beads or
charms.
Step 5.
Using the needle-nose pliers, bend the wire
back on both ends of the hoop to create two
hooks.
Slide the hoop around the stem and secure
it by interlocking those tiny hooks.
Step 6.
Enjoy your glass of wine secure in the knowledge
that it is, in fact, yours!
