one, two, three, four!
Rev up your engines!
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel
today I'm going to show you how to fix sticking power
windows and often it can be as easy as
spraying them with some silicone
lubricant, now when power windows go up
and down, they ride on the back edge and
also all the front edge where this
groove is where it goes up and down, so
the first thing to do is to roll the
window all the way down if you can,
and then liberally spray the spray
silicone lube up and down inside, I know
some people are going to say what a mess
but as long as you wipe the silicone off,
within a few minutes it doesn't hurt
anything, it actually will make the paint
shine more and its really good for doing
the rubber trim and make it a shiny
again, it's only going to bother the
paint, if you spray it on the paint and
leave it there to bake in the hot Sun
for hours and hours and hours, then it
can stain the paint a little but, once
you wipe it off immediately doesn't hurt
anything
then spray a bunch in the front too, let
it soak down on the glass edge, then you
can run the window up and down and when
it's back up, you can spray some more and
run that up and down a few times, then
wipe all the excess off again and look
how smooth that works now
and look how shiny it got the rubber
molding on the door too, compared to the
other side that I haven't done yet, see
how dirty that is and there's a reason
we're using silicone spray lubricant,
because not only is it a good lubricant
but as it says here it's water-resistant,
it can last a long time through rain
it won't just wash right off the first time
it rains, now that's important because
your windows, they got a little gap
in here when it rains lots of water runs
through there, now if you've ever
wondered what these little holes are on
the bottom of your door that go inside,
those are drain holes, they drain the
water that gets inside the door and
makes it come out here so the door
doesn't fill up with water, so water is
always flowing through your windows and
if you don't use something like a
silicone spray lube, any other kind of
Lube the water will just wash it off the
first time it rains and the windows go
back to sticking, now you want to do all
four power windows, you only need to do
it maybe once every year or a year and a
half, to keep the crud from building up
and making them bind and really that's a
small price to pay if you let one of
these window motor regulator assemblies
go bad, they can cost three four hundred
bucks for new ones, just by lubricating,
not only will they work smoother but
it'll make the motor work less stronger,
and it will last longer, so before your
power windows start sticking and binding
when you use them, you might try to
lubricate them with a little spray
silicone and save yourself a lot of
money in the long run, and remember, if you've got any
car questions just visit the Scotty
Kilmer channel and I'll answer them as
soon as I get back from the twilight
zone
