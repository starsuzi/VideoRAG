I'm chef Eric Crowley and I own the culinary 
classroom when I have a night off with my  
wife a quick and elegant meal for us is 
fettuccine alfredo with sauteed shrimp  
some nights I'll make it with scallops or 
some grilled chicken if I have vegetarians  
over I'll put in some asparagus one of my 
favorite ways is to have it all by itself  
with that creamy Parmesan richness add a small 
salad and a wonderful and elegant meal in 10  
minutes or less enjoy the video and I'll see 
you in the kitchen to make fettuccine alfredo
you
one of my best memories of fettuccine alfredo is 
after a wonderful day at the beach with my wife  
come home tired and exhausted yet we wanted to 
have a really nice romantic meal we're usually  
not home together very often had a nice bottle 
of Pinot Grigio chilling in the refrigerator and  
I thought I'll make fettuccine alfredo to start 
with my fettuccine alfredo I will need of course  
some pasta some fettuccine as the name implies 
you could use some penne or some linguine I like  
to cook it ahead of time boiling salted water the 
water should be like seawater really really salty  
as any Italian will tell you once it gets really 
nice and tender drain it run some cold water over  
it to stop the cooking and drain it again the 
reason why this is kind of shiny is because  
after it gets drained the second time you need to 
put a little oil around the pasta to keep it from  
sticking you could even make this a day ahead of 
time if you want it next ingredient I'm going to  
need is some heavy cream not light whipping cream 
not half-and-half really wonderful heavy cream a  
great ingredient near and dear to my heart perfect 
for any kind of special meal some butter will also  
be needed and some good old Parmesan cheese 
a little bit of parsley here will be used to  
finish the dish nutmeg very unusual ingredient 
in an alfredo recipe but actually very common  
when you wind up taking a look at previous recipes 
garlic lots of wonderful chopped garlic you can't  
go wrong with too much garlic and some shrimp 
to begin with the fettuccine alfredo I'm going  
to start to saute my shrimp on a medium-high heat 
on a pan I'm going to melt some butter can't even  
put it a little bit of olive oil if you want you 
don't want the pan to be so hot that the butter  
will actually burn see the butter is starting to 
get a little bit brown that's absolutely fantastic  
and then we're going to put in our garlic as much 
or as little as you'd like if it's your first date  
maybe not so much garlic going to cook that for a 
few minutes and then add in the shrimp I want to  
stir it around with a slotted spoon just until the 
shrimp lose that raw color and they start to get  
that nice pink and orange color to them they 
might still be a little bit underdone inside  
that's fine you're going to finish them off and 
continue the cooking when you make the sauce stir  
it around frequently and make sure that the shrimp 
keep moving around so they don't stick inside the  
pan once they start to curl up and a majority of 
them really start to have that nice orange color  
I like to take them out with a slotted spoon the 
reason for the slotted spoon is I want to try and  
keep as much butter and garlic inside the pan as I 
can okay so once they start to look like that I'm  
going to take them out and set them aside and get 
them nearby so they can go back into the pan when  
I'm ready to finish off the dish these shrimp are 
absolutely fantastic I just love their size if you  
wanted to use a larger one like a prawn you could 
do that you could even use bay shrimp if you can  
although bay shrimp you probably find they'll 
already be cooked so that will wind up needing  
a little bit of adjustment inside the dish after 
the shrimp are removed we're going to add in some  
good old-fashioned heavy cream about two-thirds 
of a cup you may find this labeled as whipping  
cream at the grocery store that's absolutely 
fine don't use half and half it's not going to  
work keep in mind this is for a romantic dinner 
and whenever you make a romantic dinner there's  
no calories it's immediate it's the way it is I'm 
gonna let this thicken up a little bit and then  
I'm going to put in my pasta again the pasta has 
already been cooked I like to utilize Palms for  
this particular recipe because the tongs really 
allow you to grab a hold of that pasta and twirl  
it around if you've ever tried to use a fork or 
a spoon with this it's just really cumbersome  
now you'll remember that I have a little bit 
of cream left over if the dish is starting to  
look a little bit dry on the inside of the pan 
add in some cream we'll also put in some nutmeg
and even a little pinch of salt and pepper a lot 
of times I'll take some fresh ground black pepper  
or even some white pepper it'd be nice as well 
next up the shrimp go back in to finish cooking  
just give it a little toss around again we're 
still on a medium heat nothing really outrageous  
if you feel that it's cooking too rapidly go ahead 
and lower the heat I just love the way that this  
is looking really nice and rich and creamy the 
shrimp are starting to get cooked through I can  
smell it right now that garlic a tremendous but 
I'm not done yet I need to get some Parmesan  
cheese in here and then I'm going to actually 
plate up with a little extra Parmesan cheese  
and of course before I serve it to myself my wife 
or anybody I got it taste it I'm going to pick up  
a little strand of pasta nice and garlicky but not 
too so and really nice and rich fantastic a little  
bit of extra cheese when I'm ready to serve it 
mmm and fettuccine alfredo with sauteed shrimp  
now that I have my dish seasoned the way that 
I like it I'm going to take literally a minute  
just to plate it up make it look really pretty 
I'm going to start off with some of my pasta  
again the tongs are going to really help out with 
this and a nice Tong full of pasta right into the  
center of my plate and another one for the second 
plate this is for two after all now I'll take some  
shrimp and arrange them around the pasta and then 
finish it with a little bit of Parmesan cheese oh  
that's looking so good right now Parmesan cheese 
first and some nice parsley leaves and I'll  
just pluck them and spread them throughout the 
plate that looks really fantastic and there we  
are fettuccine alfredo with sauteed shrimp my wife 
loves this dish I know you will too a little glass  
of sparkling wine and you've got a romantic dinner 
put on a little light as and let the night begin
you
