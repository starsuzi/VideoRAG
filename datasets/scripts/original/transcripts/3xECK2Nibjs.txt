here we have some
nice dutch iris
very very popular plant in the spring
but again they need to be planted about
now
and again
these are nice nice bulbs and you will
often find with the dutch iris they do
have the little shoots on them so
they're not always fully dormant
again we're looking for
bulbs which are nice and firm at the
base here these are a bit rounder
but of course the fact that they've got
a little shoot coming up the top gives
you the clue as to which way we plant
them again i think we only need about
four or five in each pot
so we just pop those in like so
just i always give them just a wee push
into the
potting mix
like so
there's one there that's just
i
the others got little shoots on us and
that's probably one i wouldn't use
because it's just not quite up to
standard you sometimes get that in the
packets
nothing to do with the quality of the
rest of the bulbs it's just the
way it is
if you have a look there on this one
here you just see the little little
shoot little
roots starting to come through
so you'll find that
they will sit there all winter like that
they'll be pushing roots during the
winter time and then they'll shoot
through later on in the stream
again just a nice
that depth twice the depth again
three times the height of the bulb is
where the base of the potting mix is or
twice the depth
on top of it
again just give it a
you
