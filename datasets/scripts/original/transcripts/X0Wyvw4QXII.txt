this is best drink recipes I'm Elia mjoy
we're going to make the OM of sour first
we'll need a rock glass full of ice
we're going to need two shakers because
we're going to build this drink in two
phases and we're going to use 2 ounces
of amaretto one full ounce of freshly
squeezed lemon juice we'll use about a/4
ounce of simple syrup that's um to taste
if you don't like it too sweet you can
omit that we're going to use some
bitters first let's put a little ice in
here and before we put in the
liquor let's build our
froth we're going to need some egg white
to do that we'll crack the egg and we
will rock the yolk back and forth about
four or five times until the egg white
separates
itself that's right we'll dispose of
this wipe our
hands and let's put in our
lemon followed
by a little simple
[Music]
syrup and we are going
[Music]
to
shake as you shake this you should be
able to hear and
feel when the white has
whipped and right about there I can feel
it and we'll let that set just a minute
while we build the rest of our
trink the
amarto and a couple dashes of
bitter let's go ahead and chill
this it's about all we
need we'll take our rocks
glass first let's strain
the
Amaretto next we'll strain our egg
whites now if you have a second strainer
go ahead and use it it will just make
the drink that much more Satin me if you
don't that's fine we'll just pour in the
top you can see we have a nice foam
froth on the top of
this we're going to put one more da Dash
right on the
top just for beauty sake and there we
have the amorado sour thank you for
