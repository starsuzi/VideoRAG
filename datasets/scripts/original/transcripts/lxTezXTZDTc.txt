Ro: Hey guys, it’s Ro! Welcome to another
Nerdy Nummies!
Ro: Today I have a very special guest, it’s
Lindsey! Lindsey: What’s up guys!?
Ro: We met on a music video for, you and Kurt
were making.
Ro: You guys know Kurt. Lindsey: Kurt’s
the man! Ro: Yeah!
Lindsey: It was actually my Pokemon music
video, hence why I’m wearing
Lindsey: my Pikachu hat, in honor of our first
ever meeting.
Ro: It was very special, I love it! I’ll
be putting all her links down below
Ro: to her YouTube channel and social medias,
so go check it out and say hi!
Ro: I got so many requests from you guys to
do something Adventure Time related,
Ro: so that is what we’re gonna do today.
When I was watching Adventure Time I
Ro: thought it was so cute, Princess Bubblegum
at the Annual Back Rubbing
Ro: Ceremony… Lindsey: Oh, oh, oh! Ro: You
get a free back rub too today! Here you go!
Lindsey: Oh that’s nice! Ro: Yeah, I thought
that would be nice after your tour.
Lindsey: Thank you! I needed that! Ro: Get a 
back rub.
Ro: Yeah, they make these cute little Strawberry
Tarts so today we are gonna
Ro: be making Adventure Time Strawberry Tarts!
Lindsey: Sounds fantastic!
Both: Let’s get started!
Ro: The things you will need to make these
Royal Tarts will be, let’s start
Ro: with the crust: A food processor, 1-1/4
cups of flour, 1/4 teaspoon of salt,
Ro: 1/3 cup of sugar, 1 stick of unsalted
butter cut up, 4 ounces of cool whip,
Ro: 1-8 ounce package of cream cheese, 1/4
teaspoon of lemon juice, and
Ro: 1/3 cup of powdered sugar sifted. You
will also need…
Lindsey: Some fresh strawberries. Ro: Mmmhmmm!
Lindsey: Glaze for strawberries,
Lindsey: A tartlet tray, a large mixing bowl,
and a hand mixer.
Ro: Now we’re gonna put it all together!
Ro: The first thing that we’re gonna do
is add our crust ingredients into
Ro: our mixer and pulse it together. Lindsey:
Nice.
Ro: So we got, a little flour. Lindsey: Boop!
Ro: Boop! And then
Ro: you want to pour in that sugar?
Ro: Little bit of sugar! Lindsey: Oh, of course!
Gotta have the sugar!
Ro: And, our little cubed butter, and these
have sat out at room temperature,
Ro: so they’re not chilled, you want to
make sure that they’re a little bit soft.
Lindsey: And some salt!
Ro: Do you want to do the honors? Lindsey:
Oh do I, do I do the pulse?
Ro: Yeah, yeah! Get it going! Lindsey:
OK.
Ro: Yes, yes! Lindsey: Whoa! How long do I
hold it?
Ro: Uh, for a little bit. Lindsey: OK!
Lindsey: So now we’re gonna take all of
our delicious ingredients, and we’re
Lindsey: gonna pack it in to the tartlet tray.
Ro: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Lindsey: It smells so
good! Ro: Oh here, I’m passing it over!
Lindsey: Oh thank you!
Lindsey: See, we’re all about teamwork!
Ro: It’s a little big crumb-y, but don’t
worry about it, because as you press
Ro: it together, it will stick together.
Lindsey: The hardest part of this, is not
eating it! Ro: Yes! Yes!
Lindsey: How do you not eat all of your crafts
while you’re making them.
Ro: Well sometimes I do when I’m test baking
them.
Lindsey: Oh yeah, OK.
Lindsey: So we’re gonna pop these little
suckers into the oven at 350,
Ro: Mmmhmmm. Lindsey: for 15 minutes.
Ro: And while they’re baking, we are gonna
make some royal tart filling.
Ro: And it is so good Linsey, last night,
I had one of these, and it did not last
Ro: a second! Lindsey: Really? Ro: It’s
so good! Lindsey: Just like, devoured?
Ro: A-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah! Lindsey: A-ha!
It’s not pretty folks!
Ro: Just like that! No! Lindsey: It’s not
pretty! Ro: No, it got a little crazy!
Ro: Our crust is baking, and now we are gonna
make the royal filling.
Ro: We’re gonna cream together a little
bit of lemon juice with our cream cheese.
Lindsey: Whoa! Ro: Get it going! Get it going!
Lindsey: Whoa!
Lindsey: Whoa this guy’s powerful!
Ro: Now we’re gonna slowly add our powdered
sugar as we mix. Lindsey: Oh!
Ro: So you slowly add. Lindsey: OK. Ro: And
I’ll be mixing.
Ro: Here we go, here we go! Nice!
Ro: And we’re just gonna mix together until
everything is well combined!
Ro: Yeah! Lindsey: This looks amazing and
this looks like pure frosting!
Ro: Now we’re gonna fold in our whipped
cream.
Ro: Have you ever folded something before
in baking?
Lindsey: Uh, yeah, I was gonna say other than
socks and t-shirts, no!
Lindsey: I didn’t even know folding was
a thing! OK.
Ro: So it’s a little bit different than
mixing. Lindsey: OK.
Ro: So usually when you mix something together,
you’re just, boop-boop-a-doop!
Ro: But folding has an art! And here it is!
Ro: So you take a big scoop of this, and you’re
gonna fold underneath everything.
Ro: Booop! And then gently fold up. And you
just kind of keep doing that motion.
Lindsey: Oh it’s starting to actually, like,
mix together. Ro: Yeah!
Lindsey: Like the colors. Ro: It’s so your
substance, whether you’re working
Ro: with a meringue or the type of filling
that we’re making today, it is so that
Ro: it holds its texture and it’s fluffy-ness!
Ro: We put our filling off to the side and
here we’ve got our bowl of fresh
Ro: strawberries. Lindsey: Oh!
Ro: And we’re gonna cut some slices to fill
them with.
Ro: So you take a strawberry, cut off the
green, I call it the butt!
Lindsey: Very appropriate! Ro: The butt of
the strawberry!
Lindsey: I mean of course! Ro: And you’re
just gonna cut thin slices.
Ro: Just keep in mind you’ll want to cut
up a couple strawberries a tart, so
Ro: however many you’re making, a couple
strawberries a tart.
Ro: And, you gotta make some more because
you gotta taste a few!
Lindsey: Sorry! Ro: That’s OK! Lindsey:
OH!
Ro: Hmm, let me see!
Lindsey: Every once in awhile you get a special
one! Ro: Aw! He’s a heart!
Lindsey: He’s a heart! It’s almost like
looking at a cloud, you know, you get
Lindsey: to figure… This could be a heart,
it could be a bear, or a frog’s head!
Lindsey: It’s a frog’s head silhouette!
Ro: I caught a frog the other day! Lindsey:
Really?
Ro: He was really slippery though. Lindsey:
Oh really? Ro: He was fast too!
Lindsey: How did you catch him? Ro: I, um…
Lindsey: You agile little creature, you!
Ro: I had to just, I had to pretend I was
a cat, and then I had to like…
Lindsey: Like a cat do! Ro: I’m a cat! And
then, and then I caught him.
Lindsey: The carnal Ro came out.
Lindsey: Alright, so our crusts have finished
baking, they are nice and sturdy,
Lindsey: see? Ro: Mmmhmmm! Lindsey: Um, we’ve
even given them time to cool off.
Ro: Yeah, we want to let them cool, you don’t
want to fill them while they’re
Ro: still warm, because your filling will
melt.
Ro: So now, are you ready for the next step?
Lindsey: Yes!
Ro: It is assembly time! So we are gonna be
making a five layered tart…
Lindsey: Wait! Ro: Just like on the cartoon
series because we want it to look
Ro: just like it. Lindsey: This is so little,
five layers in here?
Ro: You gotta make them really thin. Just
take a small spoonful… Lindsey: OK.
Ro: Put him over here, spread him around.
Lindsey: Cute!
Ro: Then put some little fresh strawberries,
little bit of glaze,
Ro: and then filling again. I’m using my
finger but that’s OK because I’m gonna
Ro: eat this one!
Lindsey: She wouldn’t do that if it was
for me! Ro: No, no, no! I wouldn’t be
Ro: doing that girl! Lindsey: Oh, no! Ro:
I would use a spatula!
Lindsey: That’s the best about cooking for
your family, you’re like,
Lindsey: ‘Ah, those germs don’t count,
we’re family!’
Ro: It’s fine, don’t worry about it!
Ro: In the show they only take the perfect
strawberry royal tarts to the party.
Lindsey: Oh! Ro: So I’m gonna try to make
mine look as good as I can, but…
Lindsey: I want mine to be chosen for the
party so bad!
Ro: But then I’m like, you know what, if
they don’t get chosen, there’s more for us!
Ro: And the last layer, a little glaze on
top!
Lindsey: I don’t know about you but I am
so pleased with how my tart looks!
Ro: It’s so cute! You did really good! Lindsey:
I think we both kinda nailed it!
Ro: These are amazing, these would get accepted!
Ro: Princess Bubblegum would give us two thumbs
up and a foot!
Lindsey: And a foot? Is that like a foot like your big
toe up?
Ro: Yeah, I just decided that, two thumbs
up, like just giving something two
Ro: thumbs up, is great. But what if it’s
just like that extra, wha-bam! Lindsey: Yeah!
Ro: What do you do then? So I'm like, it's as good as two thumbs up, and a foot!
Ro: And now our final decoration step, is
we are gonna put a little strawberry
Ro: on the top. So you just place it right
in the center and that will look just
Ro: like the royal tarts from the cartoon.
Lindsey: Oh!
Both: Ta-da!
Lindsey: You have some great vibrato! Ro:
Oh, thank you, I’ve got the vibrato,
Ro: I’m working on my legato! It’s a little
choppy but I’m working on it!
Ro: Here are the Adventure Time Royal Tarts
that we made today! Thank you
Ro: guys for suggesting them, and a big thank
you to Lindsey!
Lindsey: Thank you for having me! Ro: Helping
me bake today!
Lindsey: And teaching me to bake today! Ro:
