okay so here at my machine uh we can see
that my water level is right there so
I'm going to have to fill that up and
then we'll be ready to rock and
roll
[Music]
um so give me just a second I'll be
right
back okay we're back I got the water
filled with nice warm water I don't like
working with cold water and then I
realized I am out of leather polishing
pads which is what I use after I grind
my Stones down with my grinding wheel so
then I put it in the Dremel and I'll
show you exactly how in just a minute um
going to show you
the how the process I use to make uh my
leather grinding pads
so you can see here these are leather
pads that I have cut out into the shape
of as perfect a circle as I possibly can
because if it's offset any it will cause
vibration and I don't want vibration uh
with my tools so this one is a
320 and all I use you can see is the um
rubber cement I put a little bit of
rubber cement on both sides uh the back
side of the Sandpaper and the top side
of my leather pad and you can see these
don't bend at all they're very very
strong leather pads um I used a leather
punch and I cut
a uh nice small hole so I can put it on
my
mandrel uh the process for
making the Sandpaper circles that get
glued down I just use this right here
this
size and I'll just draw and cut them out
with my handy dandy Dollar Store
scissors easily replaceable I only use
those for cutting my
sandpaper um and I'll be back when I get
that
finished okay so you can see here is
just a standard size wet or dry
sandpaper you have to have wet sandpaper
or it will not work um but you can see I
offset the circles so as to have less
waste because this cost money and money
does not grow on
trees thanks Dad okay so I'm going to
cut these out and then I'll show you how
I put them
together okay just so you can see I
didn't have to cut out all that I had uh
driven up because drawing up because I
double stacked them I just needed 20 to
glue onto here so to do this all you got
to
do is take the rubber cement and put a
thin layer on this side you don't even
have to rip this whole paper off
seriously unless it gets too thick and
you can't uh put it on your mandrel okay
and then you put a little bit of glue on
this side and you let it dry for 15
seconds and then you just smoosh them
together very easy I'll be back after I
get these
done okay so you can see I've got them
all glued together now um I do want to
show you that I did take one of them out
the leather pad itself is
CED um
unevenly and I just don't want to use it
because I don't think that I will get an
even polish with it now I got several in
here that are CED evenly all the way
around like this one
it's kind of domed so that'll work just
fine the only thing you want to do is
make sure that you uh just press them
together so they have good contact oops
dropping them on the floor doesn't
really help
any okay so now we just let these
dry and then I'll show you how I use
them
okay so I'm going to be demonstrating
how to use the grinder that I have on
this which is a stone I collected off a
top of a mountain on one of my hikes
last summer and I cut it for giggles and
uh turned out to be a pretty amazing
little Stone which you'll be able to see
much better when we get done here so
these are mandrels okay that's what
we'll be putting the
leather circles on on too um and then
this is the punch that we
use so I'll be going going over that in
a second but here's some stones that I
have set up for my level
600
grp okay got lots of fun jewelry there
that I'm working on and then over here
you can see I have some pieces that I am
using smaller uh polishing uh bits a
mandrels
um that I buy from a lapidary supply
store and then you can see right
here uh this is all the jewelry that I'm
working on
currently don't look in my sink it's
full of dirty dishes spend more time
working on my rocks than cleaning which
is very naughty so these are the stones
that I still have yet to polish with the
320 once I do that I'll go and stick it
in the pile to be polished at the 600
once I get all these done and put in the
600 pile that's when I'll start on that
I like to get stuff finished in groups
to me it just makes more sense because
the way I have to do it
um but yeah so I'll be right back with
my leather pads
