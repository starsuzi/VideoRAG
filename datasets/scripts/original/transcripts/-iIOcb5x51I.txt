hello again it's Stephanie from cupcakes
and Sury and today I'm going to be
making a pavlova now Pavlova is a
traditional Australian dessert that I
grew to love when I went to school in
Australia the Pavlova I'll be making
today is going to be covered with
whipped cream and an assortment of
berries the ingredients needed to make
the Pavlova are 1 teaspoon of white
vinegar 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
half a tablesp of corn corn starch 1 cup
of super fine
sugar and four egg
whites here I have a stand mixer with
the Whisk attachment on we're going to
start by pouring the egg whites into the
bowl turn your mixer on high and wait
until your egg whites begin to look
Fluffy at this time you can start adding
your sugar
add your sugar at about 1 tablespoon at
a time until all the sugar is
incorporated your egg whites will look
shiny and white at this
point now you can start adding the corn
starch vanilla
extract
and white
vinegar stop the mixer using a spatula
scrape down the sides of the bowl making
sure everything's mixed
well turn the mixer back on high and
watch until the egg whites look stiff
about 3 to 4 minutes more once the egg
whites are stiff stop the mixer and look
to see if the egg whites keep their
shape if not continue mixing until stiff
peaks
form here I have a baking sheet lined
with parchment paper using a spatula
scrape all the egg whes onto the baking
sheet making a mound of egg
whites smooth off the top of the mering
the oven has been preheated to 300° F
once the pufflova is inside turn down
the oven to
250°
f after an hour and 15 minutes open the
door a little bit and turn off the oven
let the Pavlova sit for about 45 minutes
or until fully cool
once fully cooled take the Pavlova out
of the
oven we're now going to assemble it but
first we need to make some whipped cream
the ingredients we need are a half a
teaspoon of vanilla extract 1 tbsp of
sugar and one cup of whipping
cream with the Whisk attachment on pour
the whipping cream into the
bowl
Whisk on high for about 1
minute add the
sugar and vanilla to the whipping
cream continue whisking until the
whipping cream is stiff and
fluffy transfer the whipped cream onto
the the Pavlova and top with berries or
anything you'd
like and here's our finished blueberry
raspberry and Gooseberry Pavlova nice
and crisp on the outside gooey and
marshmallowy on the
inside thanks for watching
