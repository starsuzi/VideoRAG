This is the most difficult garment Teach Me Fashion has done so far!
You will need to sew an invisible zip and line a bodice.
I have tried to use the simplest methods I know.
There are quite a lot of different ways to do various techniques, if you are an experienced sewer,
please feel free to use your own tried and true methods.
I have used a bonded knit for this dress, it is quite thick, almost like a lightweight neoprene or wet suit fabric.
You could use any stable fabric.
I would advise you to try a sample of the bodice to make sure it fits you over the bust.
If you need more room just unpick from the armhole to the bust point and you will see how much extra space you need to allow on these pattern pieces.
Before you cut this dress out please check that the skirt is long enough for you,
as you can see by the photos it is fairly short!
It is simple to lengthen the pattern just add the extra length to the hem edge of the skirt pattern pieces.
Once you have cut the dress out, notch all your seam allowances and mark the ends of the darts with a pin or if you are more comfortable use a needle and thread.
Remove the pattern pieces and pin the darts into position.
Make sure you do both the front and the back of the skirt.
Now remove the patterns from the bodice pieces and pin the center fronts to the side fronts,
making sure you have the right sides of the fabric together.
Match the notches as you pin.
Go to the machine and stitch along the seam allowance line.
Repeat this process for the back bodice.
Press all the seam allowances toward the center front and the center back respectively.
There is no need to neaten these seams as they will be enclosed by the lining later.
Pin and stitch the side seams and the shoulder seams together.
Press these seams open, there is no need to neaten these seams.
Stitch the darts on the front and back skirt pieces.
Start at the outside edge and stitch to the end of the dart.
Reverse over the end of your stitching, staying on the machine line. This secures the end of the dart.
Press these darts towards the center front and the center back respectively.
Place the front and back skirt pieces with right sides together and pin.
Stitch on the seam allowance line.
Press these seams open.
These seams will need to be neatened as I haven't lined the bottom of the dress.
So either zigzag or over lock if you have one.
Now to the lining, stitch the center front to the side front and the center back to the side backs.
Make sure you have the right sides of the lining together.
Again, no need to neaten these seams.
Press all these seams towards the center front and the center back.
Stitch side seams and shoulder seams together and press open.
No need to neaten these seams either.
Now to the peplum, this is also lined
With right sides together pin the peplum lining and peplum fabric together along the outside edge,
that is the edge with the biggest curve.
Stitch along the seam allowance line.
Pull the lining back and edge stitch on the lining.
Make sure you have the seam allowance underneath your stitching.
This row of stitching helps make the edge roll back so you don't have the lining showing on the outside of the garment.
Press this edge and you will see how the seam stays back.
Pin the tucks on the peplum into position,
the value of the tucks does toward the center front and center back.
Stay stitch these into position.
Now lay the skirt out in front of you on the table with the right side up and pin the peplum to the skirt waist.
Match your notches as you pin.
Stay stitch these into position.
Trim your seam allowance as I am here to reduce the bulk at the waist .
I am using quite a thick bonded knit,
if you are using a lighter weight fabric this step may not be necessary.
Now pin the bodice to the skirt with right sides together.
Make sure that you match your side seams on the skirt and the bodice.
Stay stitch these into position.
