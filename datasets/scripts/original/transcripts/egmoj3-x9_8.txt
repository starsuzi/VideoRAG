a really attractive way to serve your
barbecue food
is to get the lovely crisscross lines
that we associate with grilled food
now this is really easy to do all you're
going to need is a griddle pan like i've
got here and you can tell a griddle pan
by the ridges and it's these ridges that
will give you the crisscross pattern
that we're looking for
now all you need to do is get the
barbecue really hot pop your griddle pan
on top and let it heat up so that it
gets
very very hot now you can use the
stainless steel grid on your barbecue
but it's the cast iron that'll give you
a much
better effect right i've got a lovely
juicy steak here with some olive oil and
salt and pepper on
and i'm just going to pop it onto the
bbq with my tongs and what you need to
do is put it on
at an angle like this
so this has had a couple of minutes and
what i'm going to do is turn it at a 45
degree angle to get the diamond shape
that we're looking for
just very carefully lift it up place it
down
and then again just leave it for a
couple of minutes before we flip it over
right this is ready now so i'm going to
turn it over and we'll see these
lovely criss-cross patterns look at that
that is
beautiful it's perfect and what i've
done is i've actually moved it to the
other side
so this side is much much hotter than
that side so we're going to get the same
crisscross pattern straight away
i'm going to turn this as well so we get
the 45 degree angle here so just very
carefully pick it up
turn it round pop it down and let that
finish cooking so we get the crosses on
both sides it's going to be beautiful
for me this is perfectly done but if
you're cooking something like chicken
that might need a little bit longer
what you could do is just move on to the
slightly cooler side to finish off
cooking but let's get this off it's
ready
just going to pop it onto a plate and
let it rest
beautiful look at that and this works
with anything you could use aubergines
any kind of vegetable as well
beautiful crisscross pattern you can
also do fish you can just pop it onto
the griddle
and turn it both ways to get the same
effect or you can use a specific
fish griddle and what this does is hold
the fish together while you're cooking
it
pop the fish in put it straight onto the
barbecue grill
and turn it halfway perfect so there you
go using a griddle pan it's a simple way
to get great looking food to impress
your friends and family this summer
