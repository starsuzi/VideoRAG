hey y'all it's me Hy and I am making our
supper and I'm making salmon
croates and my son said did you make a
video for that and I said no I didn't
and I had to make some more so I'm gonna
show you how I do it just real little
Quicky this is my hot grease I've got
going
uh I've got temperature rise about 365
but if you don't have a way to know that
just it make it on the high side of
medium and cut it down if it's going too
much okay but I've got just two cans of
canned salmon and I went in here and I
took all the skin out and all that stuff
I left the liquid though you need the
liquid so as you can see I kind of just
flaked it up a little bit with my hands
best way to do it and I've got two eggs
I've already beaten and I'm going to add
that into the
bowl and I have two sleeves the rule is
per can one
egg and one sleeve of crackers just
regular Sal crackers then you just get
your hand in here I hope you can see
this good I'll show you you just get
your hand in there and just you don't
want to over mix it but you want it
everything together where you can make a
Patty out of it
now that wasn't hard was it some things
you just got to get in there and with
your hands that's just the only way to
do it so as you can
see
and now I'm taking some up and I make my
patties about
3/4 of an inch thick and in between 3
and 4 in
diameter and that's how we do
it and you just keep going I get about
four in this pan I've been cooking for a
while
so I'm sorry I didn't think to bring you
in on it on my
own as you can see you see this bubble
here I hope you can see this good on
camera but that's a good little Sizzle
going there not too much not too little
you want them done in the
middle uh-oh I broke that one but we're
going to leave that anyway not going to
retrieve
it so anyway you get the idea about 3/4
thick and in between depending on your
pan in between 3 and 4 Ines in diameter
okay and in between two and 3 minutes
each side don't walk away everybody's
stoves different you need to babysit
this and then lift
up check it this won't be ready but I'm
just showing you lift up like that and
check it you see how golden these
are and there you have it isn't that
easy well folks a cameraman hat I was
ending it and I was just going to tell
you uh great sides to go with this would
be you could serve it with tartar sauce
or ketchup macaroni baked
beans uh Hush Puppies french fries any
anything like that that you like will go
great with these uh steamed veggies
whatever you want with your family so
the last thing I'll say is
enjoy and I'll see you next time
