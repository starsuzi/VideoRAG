Hi, this is Joelle Meijer.
I will show you how to dry the leaves of trees
or plants
whether you want to create an herbarium or
for any other project.
For this project, you will need large books
like telephone directories
or encyclopedias, old newspapers and leaves.
Start by collecting leaves of different shapes,
different sizes, different colours
and preferably without defects.
If you pick up fallen leaves in the Fall,
do not take those that are already dry and
deformed because they might be too brittle.
Take a first large book and place some folded
newsprint on top.
Open the newsprint and put some leaves flat
on the paper, without overlapping them.
Close the newsprint and place a book on top.
Take another newspaper that you open and place
more leaves.
Again, close the newspaper and place a book
on top.
Continue the process as many times as necessary.
Avoid using glossy paper such as magazines
or flyers
because it does not absorb as much moisture
from the leaves.
After two weeks, the leaves should be completely
dry.
Take the pile of books and newspapers holding
the leaves
and carefully, remove the dried leaves and
keep them for future projects.
