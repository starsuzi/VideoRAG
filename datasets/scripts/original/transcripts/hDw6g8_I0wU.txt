well I was doing some cleanup work and I
was thinking about dumping the dirt out
of this
long pot here
and before I did I know some green and
along with some miscellaneous weeds
there's a tiny
Iris
growing right there and then there's one
a little taller
oh there it is
and there
and then on the other end there's a
couple of taller ones
but I planted these in the fall
of 2014
and then last spring I checked to see if
they came up and I remember checking
until about mid-june or so and then I
finally just gave up on them and my wife
planted some stuff in this
planner and
I forgot all about them completely until
this spring
it finally came up
here's one that's broken off but anyway
I thought that was kind of neat that
is like a year and a half before they
came up
