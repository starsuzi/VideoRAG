CED and uh also got a cup of raisins a
cup and a half of pecans chopped and a
half a cup of flour and I mixed it all
in a bowl mixed it up real good and now
we're going to start on the Cake part
and in a separate Bowl we're going to
mix one one box of cake mix
going put that in the
bowl then we're going to
use
one package of instant vanilla pudding
and pie

eggs then we're going to
do 1/4 cup of
water and a half a cup of
oil and during this whole time
we got the oven preheated to
300° and we're going to let this we're
going to let this mix for 3
minutes we're going to let that do its
thing for about 3 minutes it's going to
be pretty thick
and then we're going to start pouring in
our fruit
mixture okay so after 3 minutes we're
going to start pouring in our fruit
mixture a little bit at a
time and let that get all Incorporated

if it looks like it's going to get too
thick you know just add a little
[Applause]
water and you know the way I measure
I've
uh I've added some extra fruit and some
extra nuts so we're going to add a
little
water and then we're going to get the
rest of this
Incorporated so it's going to be a thick
consistency kind of like peanut

a
a tube pan here I'm going to spray it up
real good and pour the batter in

knife around the edges and if we grease
our pan good it shouldn't
