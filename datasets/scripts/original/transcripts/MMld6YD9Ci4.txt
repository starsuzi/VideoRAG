all right you guys this is Cory Draper
and right now I'm just driving a brand
new 2015 freight liner yep I'm in
gorgeous Utah just heading east you can
see the East Mountain right there on the
other side is Park City I think you guys
have all heard of that City but anyway
let me turn my stereo down and I just
wanted to go you know kind of just show
a quick video about how the automatic
transmissions
work and you can hear it kind of
Shifting away and whatnot but I've got a
freeway on ramp and right now
I've got the shifter um you know and you
can see it right there I've got another
video that kind of explains it a little
better on how it works but right now I
just got it in economy
mode you can see it's in 11th gear there
uh it's a
13-speed it's in
economy and I'm going to hit the little
button on the steering column here and
I'm going to put it in performance mode
and I'll show you just how it shifts
when going up and on ramp uh right now I
I wish I had a full l cuz it's a lot
nicer to have 880,000 lb uh total but
I'm Bob Bob tailing you guys know how
bouncy fun that is and these Utah roads
right here aren't the best
but but yeah I'm in a 2015 uh Cascadia
beautiful truck it's only got about 30
40 mil on it so it's got that badass
smell got a love freight liner all right
well coming up here and just a quarter
mile I'm going to take a right turn
okay and in the automatic mode you know
it just does all the shif and down I've
got the engine braks off right
now okay the off ramp's just right here
to the
right now just hold the just record and
you guys can maybe watch how how it
shifts all right okay I'll try to slow
up here a little bit yeah it's real dead
right now
okay now there's the on-ramp okay now I
just hit the little button and it's in
performance mode okay now I'm in fifth
gear okay it goes to
seventh see how smooth it is it just
goes 5 7
9 yeah there just chose
10 and there we are in 11th
gear and you can see it's just so smooth
already going 55 and right now it's up
there in the Top Gear uh which is 12
okay and that was a performance shifting
where it goes a little faster when you
want to get just a little better speed
you know when you're going on an on-ramp
um it has the economy mode on these new
automatic transmissions and it just kind
of short shifts a little bit just for
you know probably better mileage I guess
or whatnot but I always like to
accelerate on the
on-ramp uh in performance mode and all
you do on the right side of the steering
wheel is just push a button it has three
positions you just press it one time and
it's a automatic economy you press it
one more time it goes into automatic
performance and then you press it one
other time and you can do full manual
where you know it's kind of like an F1
shifter on a Porsche or a or a Ferrari
where you just you know
squeeze the the knob towards you and
that shifts upward and you push it
towards the dash and it shifts down it's
kind of fun actually but yeah rid's good
well this automatic just smooth as hell
and like I said in my other video you
know it's got full engine brakes and
everything else you can see it right
there just super simple yeah look for my
other video and you can you I do a
better uh explanation of how to actually
shift but I just wanted to show you just
how nice it is accelerating on an on
ramp so all right hope you like the
video all right take it easy guys talk
to you later
