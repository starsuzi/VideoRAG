I'm Julia Ziegler-Haynes.
I'm a Brooklyn based
artist and chef.
[NOISE] Three years ago,
I started a supper club
called The Dinner Bell,
a true underground eating
experience, and as
a bonafide control freak,
I wear many hats
to pull it off.
More often than not, I'm
left with a mishmash of
leftovers, and while
many saner people would
collapse in an exhausted
heap after all that,
my masochistic side kicks
in, and what do I do?
Repurpose the leftovers,
and
invite friends over for
lunch.
[MUSIC]
Today, I'm making
homemade focaccia for
lamb meatball sandwiches
with a fennel and
herb slaw and
The leftovers that we
have from last night's
dinner are meatballs,
strawberries, and ramps.
So, it's not much
to choose from, but
we're gonna beef it up,
and try to
make something really
different and special.
We're gonna make
a focaccia.
It's fucking delicious.
It's like, basically
fried in olive oil.
So, you're not
gonna mess it up.
Ideally, it's best to get
your bread dough together
as quickly as possible
and as early as possible,
cuz it does take
a little bit of time.
The ingredients for
the focaccia should
be in your pantry.
Everyone should have
flour, salt, and yeast.
We're gonna take
two tablespoons of
coarse salt, and then I'm
gonna grab some yeast.
I prefer the jarred
variety of yeast, and
there's actually
an expiration date on it.
You know,
yeast dies pretty easily.
So, now, starting with
the seven cups of flour,
dump it right
into your mixer.
If you don't
have a mixer,
you can just dump
it into a bowl.
I find that you get a
nicer crumb if you do it
with this machine,
and I had it.
So, I wanted to show off.
Dumping our salt and
yeast in,
give it a quick spin.
This is two cups
of our three and
a half cups of water.
You can just pour
it right in there.
Focaccia is very
easy to make.
In fact,
I like it so much,
cuz I'm fairly lazy, and
you can basically wake up
in the morning, throw the
ingredients together, and
hours later,
throw it in the oven.
And it's good to lube it
up with some olive oil,
cuz dough is not
finicky at all.
It'll do it's thing.
Just give it
a quick stir.
It's okay if
the olive oil
incorporates a little
bit.
We, take a little bit
of a dampened cloth,
drape it over.
This'll take about two
and half, three hours.
[MUSIC]
Well, our three
hours is up.
I had a whole pack of
cigarettes and two cases
of whiskey, and now it's
time to bake our bread.
Reveal.
Oh, yeah.
That looks different.
Make sure you have a nice
big baking sheet on hand.
Always good to
lube up the pan,
and then lightly
start to sort of
szhugh it around, and
it feels like the most
supple breasts you've
ever felt in your life.
My favorite part
is coming up, and
that's when you start to
put dimples in it, and
pretend like you're
playing like,
'80s synthesizer.
[SOUND] The final,
crucial touch is
grey sea salt.
I love grey sea salt.
I'm kind of like one of
those freaks that goes to
stores, and
makes them write down my
phone number, and call me
when they get it in bulk.
A little goes a long way,
and it's super tasty.
Ready to pop, and
stop, and drop?
So, 450 for 45.
That's really easy
to remember even for
an idiot.
You know, if you have
an electric oven,
that's a different story.
I cannot help you,
cuz you're a freak.
Having people over
the morning after a party
is crucial.
So, today I'm having
my friends Merica and
George, who are a married
couple, but
also bandmates.
And they are in
an awesome band called
The Naked Heroes,
a Brooklyn based band.
Yeah, have a seat.
My little guinea
pig victims.
Tell me if this
sounds good, and
shut the hell up
if it doesn't.
>> [LAUGH]
>> I'm gonna make us
some meatball sandwiches.
>> Oh.
>> It's gonna be
a nice, juicy-
>> Wet.
>> Thick, wet,
meaty sandwich.
>> Creamy [LAUGH].
>> Stop that.
This is a family
restaurant.
So, who can I trust
with a knife?
>> Not George.
>> Not George.
George, would your
pretty little fingers be
okay picking herbs?
>> They sure will.
>> That's what his
fingers are good for.
>> Revealing too much
about your marriage,
there.
The dill's gonna be in
our slaw with a bunch
of other herbs.
So, I'm just gonna
start piling on.
>> Wow, you,
you are piling on.
>> This is,
we've got parsley.
>> You are piling it on.
>> Yeah.
Cilantro, and dill.
Don't feel overwhelmed.
Your fennel here is gonna
go with George's herbage
to make a beautiful slaw.
>> Is it true that
certain people have,
like, some weird innate
reaction to cilantro?
>> Yes, it tastes like
dish soap to them.
>> Is that what it does?
>> Yeah.
They call it an allergy,
which, to me,
is a little much.
>> Just being a pussy.
[LAUGH].
>> So, for
the fennel slaw,
we're gonna take
what we just shaved,
George's herbage, just
toss that in, squeezing
half a lemon or so,
maybe a full, full lemon.
That same gray sea
salt that we topped
the bread with, and then
some delicious olive oil.
That's gonna chill out,
there.
In the meantime,
we're gonna give you
some feta cheese.
This is gonna be
a little challenging.
Oh, god,
you all are struggling.
>> [LAUGH].
>> You're making me feel
like a real professional.
>> I've never
done this before.
>> No, that's perfect.
>> Really?
>> I mean, what am
I gonna say, really?
And then, naoli.
I don't know if you guys
have been around for
that before, but
it's a real experience.
The basic balance of any
Aioli, it's an acid,
egg, and oil.
Aioli is just mayo
with garlic in it.
And we've got a little
bit of garlic.
That's one clove
that I kind of
bashed with my fists.
And then salt.
And then very,
very slowly,
you wanna start
adding the olive oil.
>> We've gotten to go to
Spain a couple times,
which is the delicious
food capital
of the world.
>> That's what they
think. >> They
definitely think that,
and every region,
they're like,
our food is the best.
>> They're German?
>> [LAUGH]
They, yes.
>> So, we've got
these beautiful little
ramps left over.
>> Oh, cute.
>> Yeah.
Actually, I've
never done it
with a blender,
but we'll see.
No pressure.
That's how I
like to roll.
Nine times out of ten,
if not ten times out ten,
I'm making something for
the first time,
live for people.
Just so you guys feel
guilty you should know,
I've been up for hours
waiting for this bread.
>> You look like it!
[LAUGH].
>> You're fired.
So, this guy
got real puffy.
Smell it,
give it a good whiff.
>> Oh, god.
>> There's nothing
like that smell.
>> What, what were
you listening to
about people getting,
male,
the different sense
that men and wome-
>> Cinnamon buns
makes men horny.
>> And baked bread.
>> Yeah,
it's all kinds of
like weird Oedipus shit.
It's like stuff that has
to do with their mom.
I went to an an open
house one time, and
it's like he overdosed
on reading like,
what kind of scents
people enjoy.
And he had like cooked
bacon, sprayed perfume.
He literally was in
the backyard with like,
a weird fake tiki lounge,
like shaking
up drink,s and
he had the TV blaring.
And Nazi war memorabilia
hung up in his-
>> Where is,
where is this?
>> I'm not
gonna tell you,
cuz he'd probably
come kill me.
>> [LAUGH]
>> These
are fucking huge.
Are we hungry, or
are we hungry?
>> Yeah, we're hungry.
>> So,
we wanna do a nice,
big slather of the aioli.
>> That's amazing!
>> Both sides.
All right, and
the meatballs have been
braising, forming
up nicely.
>> Wow.
>> Oh.
>> Take a gander.
>> Yeah, those look good.
>> All kinds of
things happening.
All kinds of
color in there.
>> That's mold.
>> [LAUGH].
>> We're gonna top it
with our herb slaw.
Don't be shy get
your hand in there.
Some nice chunks of feta.
>> Yeah.
>> I think a good
sandwich has
a little salt, some acid,
all the good things, like
fattiness with a crunch,
but with a gooshy inside.
Oh, shit.
>> Hm.
[LAUGH].
>> That's a sandwich.
>> This is great.
>> Wow,
it's fucking good.
>> It's crusty, but it's
so moist on the inside.
>> Yeah.
>> Just like
my personality.
>> [LAUGH].
>> Crusty on the outside
>> And
moist on the innards.
>> And
moist on the inside.
>> This is a really
amazing use of leftovers.
Easy peasy.
Any idiot, like you,
could do it.
>> [LAUGH].
>> It's true.
Well, thank you guys
again for joining me.
>> Thank you, Julia.
>> Thanks for
having us, Julia.
>> I hope you come
back and join us again.
