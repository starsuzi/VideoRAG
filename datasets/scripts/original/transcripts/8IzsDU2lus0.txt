Bristol is a lovely place to live but
the limescale that we get in our kettles
it isn't so lovely
however there's kind of easy way to do
it this stuff citric acid bring some in
boil the kettle Norway a while if that
funny noise in the background is my
pathetic
so watch this
[Music]
[Music]
this is so much nicer than the stuff in
history
[Music]
there it goes on fizzy fizzy
Wow you see that lift off this is really
such a nothing actually
[Music]
you can see that that is doing the job
here that's just brilliant
this is I think one pound 79 from other
diets
[Laughter]
break it up
I think we'll call that a job done I'm
just gonna rinse it out with a bit of
water by landscape in just a few seconds
you'll see this stuff nowhere
sometimes it takes two goes but this
looks like it's been very actually cool
brilliant stuff citric acid it rocks
