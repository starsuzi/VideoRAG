The best decks are ones that get tons of use
and are fully enjoyed.
We hope your bamboo composite deck sees many
good times and many parties even if this means
a bit of clean-up afterward.
Here are some general cleaning tips for keeping
your deck looking good as new for years to
come.
1.
Try to do general cleaning in the Spring and
Fall.
(This is basically so you can clean-up after
winter snows and summer BBQs!)
2.
To remove stains we recommend using a deck
brightener like Cabot Wood Brightener or Olympic
Premium Deck Cleaner.
Remember that these products are meant to
be diluted in a bucket with water first.
Read the manufacturer’s instructions to
make sure you’re mixing everything correctly.
3.
Different cleaning products can be used but
it’s a good idea to check to see if it contains
oxalic acid (Most wood brighteners do.), and
test it on an inconspicuous area of your deck
beforehand to make sure it doesn’t stain.
4.
First, spray the area off with a hose to get
rid of all surface debris.
5.
Spread your cleaning mixture around with a
push broom and scrub it into the deck.
6.
Then, let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes
before rinsing with water.
7.
For more stubborn residue you may also use
warm, soapy water and a soft bristle brush.
Regular Dawn dish soap works well.
Be sure to rinse the soap away with fresh
water when you’re done.
