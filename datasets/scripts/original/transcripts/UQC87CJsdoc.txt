I'm clar and I'm going to be showing you
how to make a sparkling array of
projects perfect for that special day
whether it's for your own wedding or for
someone else join me as we create
everything from hair combs to bracelets
and necklaces let's get started
[Music]
wine glass charms are a fantastic way of
adding that Personal Touch to your table
at your wedding breakfast they're really
easy to make as well and you can make
them as cheap or as expensive as you
want by using crystals or cheaper glass
beads and using lots of beads or less so
I'm just going to show you one really
easy way and then I'll show you a few
variations as
well all you need is ring memory wire
I've gone for
silverplated some pendants or charms or
anything to add in the middle and
perhaps some beads as
well when you use memory wire something
really important to use is either memory
wire cutters which are a heavyduty wire
cutter or some large chunky Cutters that
you don't mind possibly getting damaged
I'm also going to use some round nose
pliers and I'm going to keep my chain
nose pliers handy just in
case I'm going to cut just over one coil
off so I'm going to have one coil and
let it overlap by about half a
centimeter on each
side and you're going to have to really
if you've got memory wire cutters it's
really easy if you're using some heavy
duty Cutters just give it a good squeeze
and it should snap
off I'm going to make my Loop
first gripping with your
thumb you're going to take your round
nose
pliers get a good grip so you've just
got the very tip of the memory wire
sticking out pushing into your thumb
you're going to bend that wire around
and into a loop if you run out of steam
you're going to have to take your pliers
out put them back in again and twist
back
round pushing into your thumb all the
time it's harder to grip the smaller
memory wire than it is the larger memory
wire but bear with it give it a good
squeeze and really good pressure and
bend that all the way around
until you've got a p-shaped loop like
this so what I'm going to do for this
one I've used a simple
decoration of just two seed beads with a
shovsky pendant B cone in the middle
it's just really simple you could
personalize these by perhaps using um
the initial of your guest and getting a
little charm or you could um color theme
it to your table theme or if you've got
maybe a heart theme you could use little
heart charms there's the end possib AB
ities are endless so I'm going to thread
on two little seed beads to make one the
same as
this and then I'm going to pop my
pendant Bic cone
on and two more beads
and to finish I'm just going to make
another loop as I did
before so I'm going to grip the very end
of the
wire holding and bending
around and there you can see it's
slightly overlapping so that's why I've
got my chain nose pliers handy to just
gently squeeze that
down cuz you don't want those little
seed beads falling
off I'm going to bend that back a little
bit The Beauty with memory wire is you
can bend it quite a lot without it
distorting or snapping so there we go a
lovely and very easy memory wire um wine
charm and you can see they don't take
long to make so they're great as wedding
favors and your guests can always take
them away with them as well why not add
lots of seed beads you could add them in
a color or in just clear or silver to
complete the whole ring and then they
just snap onto the wine glass and you're
ready to go
