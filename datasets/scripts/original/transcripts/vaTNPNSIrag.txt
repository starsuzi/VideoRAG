hello and welcome to Meadow Brown Bakery
in this video I'll be showing you how to
make this very pretty colorful fairy
cakes
start off by preheating your oven to 180
degrees Celsius
line your fairy cake tray with paper
liners and put it to one side
in a bowl of butter add your sugar and
cream this mixture together
add in your eggs one at a time and mix
well between each egg added
add your vanilla and mix
then your flour
and then add in your yogurt
mix it until it's nice and smooth
and then add in your sprinkles and mix
until they're all mixed in
divide the mixture between the fairy
cake trays and bake in the preheated
oven for 13 to 15 minutes
test with a toothpick if it comes out
clean they're ready
put them on a cooling rack to cool
completely before decorating
