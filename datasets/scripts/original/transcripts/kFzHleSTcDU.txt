hey guys Philly boy Jay here back with
another video showing you guys how to
make black IPS my
way the new year is
naring and Americans love to bring in a
New Year's with their family and friends
so they usually throw a party on New
Year's Eve and they make a nice big
dinner and one of the things that
Americans commonly make on New Year's
Eve for dinner to bring the New Year's
or black IPS especially within the black
community or African-American culture so
it was a tradition in my family I'm
going to be showing you guys how I make
my black ey peas here we have Goya black
ey peas 16 o
back all right and I like to soak these
in some water overnight that's the way
my family always did
it what that does is that shortens the
cooking
time but what we're going to do first is
we're going to remove the bad beans okay
there's always quite a few bad beans in
a bag of black
IPS and pretty much any beans that you
get you'll find a few cracked bad ones
we don't want to cook those
okay okay so you're going to get a bowl
and you're going
to add your beans
like this here okay might not get all of
them but try to remove as many as
possible
okay all right guys so what we're going
to do is we're going to fill this bowl
of peas with water and then we're going
to store them in the refrigerator
overnight and we'll cook them tomorrow
all
right so filling up with
[Music]
water it's all the water you
[Applause]
need okay
and we're just going to let them sit
overnight we're going to move on and
talk about the other
ingredients that you're going to need to
make the world's best black eyed
peas Make sure you have some smoked ham
Hawks if you don't eat pork you can use
smoked turkey tows you want to rinse
them off with cool
water this is what's going to give our
blackout peas in amazing flavor so you
have to have ham Hawks or turkey
toes I'm going to be adding some onions
and some green bell peppers
to my black ey
peas sometime I use fresh tomatoes but I
don't have any fresh tomatoes so I'm
going to be using some diced
tomatoes okay so that's not a vegetable
that I'm going to be using but make sure
you Dice up some green bell peppers and
some onions for the full recipe visit
phillyjaycooking.com with all the exact
measurements cooking time and detailed
instructions all right so as I said I'm
going to be using some diced
tomatoes you're going to need some
minced garlic I'm going to be using minc
garlic and garlic powder some butter or
margarine but I prefer to use butter
butter is better and everything and
you're going to need some chicken broth
but you can use vegetable stock or broth
if you want all right um You can even
just use water but just to enhance
flavor I like to use a broth or stock
all
right yeah I know these are a lot of
seasonings right but as many seasonings
as this is can you believe it's still
only like 1/3 of all the seasonings that
I have in my seasoning
cabinet yes I'm a cook and you know
cooks and chefs we have a lot of
seasonings in our kitchen but you're
going to need most of these seasonings
to create your Philly boy J's crei
seasoning okay you call it crei or
Creole seasoning okay so let's get
straight to it you're going to need some
cumin that is so important the cumin uh
oh my God you need to
cumin the chicken flavor Buon cubes
we're going to be adding to the pop of
peas but this is obviously not a part of
my Creole seasoning recipe you're going
to need some black pepper some garlic
powder some thyme some chili powder some
oregano you got to have the oregano
that's one of the most important
seasonings brown sugar yes brown sugar
onion powder
celery salt not regular salt this is not
optional you have to have celery salt in
your Creo
seasoning cyne pepper just give it a
kick of
spiciness paprika is for color even
though you get some color from the chili
powder add paprika anyway and last but
not least we're going to be adding some
bay leaves okay now you can just get
some Creo seasoning from the store
instead of combining all of these SE
seasonings to create Philly boy J's Creo
seasoning recipe that is an option okay
but it may not taste exactly the same so
I would just use some Creo seasoning if
I was you but if you ever get a chance
to get all of these seasonings and
combine them together to create Philly
boy J's Creo seasoning recipe I
recommend that you do it because it is a
great combination okay and all of the
amounts and measurements that you need
are on my website all right so make sure
you have all of these
seasonings all right guys so it's the
next day and here's our IPS as you can
see they kind of swollen
up they're
swell so um we're going to drain this
water in the colender uh and you can see
that they look pretty soft as well
not soft but they're definitely not as
hard as they was once we added them to
the water
[Applause]
all right guys what you're going to do
is you're going to get your pot you're
going to place it over medium
heat and you're going to add
your butter
okay guys we're going to follow that up
by adding
our green peppers and our
onions and we're going to
saut√© these
for about 5
minutes and while that's in there we're
going to go ahead and
add our minced
garlic one big
[Music]
tablespoon stir that in
then all right guys so it's been 5
minutes that you can see our vegetables
are well
sauteed I'm going to add my buan cubes
now I'm going to add my bay leaves using
three bay leaves and three
Buon
cubes going to add my
seasoning all right
[Music]
oh smells
amazing going to add the
Hawks going to add our beans
going to add our
broth the order in which you add this
stuff really don't matter
okay going to add some
water and I can't tell you how amazing
that Philly boy J Creo seasoning smells
oh my
God oh my
gosh we're going to now add our diced
tomatoes what they going to give it an
amazing
flavor a lot of people don't add diced
tomatoes to their black IPS but I
do it's amazing
all
right and we're going
to let this simmer and cook we are going
to cover it with a
top as I always say make sure
that you leave a crack on the side when
you cover it with a lid do not fully
cover
it and we're going to let this go for a
while get back with you guys
when it's
done and there you go guys here are your
black odd
peas by Philly boy
J and the meat from the ham
Hots had fallen off the
bone um some people like a lot of meat
others don't so as I always say you're
free
to customize the recipe to your liking
you can add instead of using three
smoked ham Hawks you can just use two or
one but you have to make sure that you
use at least one because that's what
give the black IPS that
flavor okay
but yeah those are your black I peas and
as I said when you're making black ey
peas it creates its own gravy so you
don't have to add any flour nothing like
that remember somebody on my last video
asked me J you need to add any flour
they said um their parents added flour
to it I'm like to Black Op peas never
heard of that one but uh yeah man here
are your black I peas
and everything that we added give these
Black Op peas a amazing flavor
amazing
flavor um make sure you
remove
the bay
leaves they should still be
intact unless they
um
disintegrated okay another one right
