Hello today we are going to talk about cleaning
road dirt from your tires. This is a very
important process in cleaning the vehicle
so what I am going to do is just give you
some general guidelines to make sure that
you adhere to and successfully clean your
tires and make sure that there aren't any
hazardous materials embedded in your tire.
The first thing you always want to do is inspect
your tire, look at it to make sure there aren't
any nails in it or anything like that that
have been accumulated during your driving
and after you have inspected it you are just
going to spray it down. I am going to take
my sprayer here and then just spray the tire
down. This helps to loosen the dirt before
we start brushing it off with our brush and
now that it is wet we are going to apply our
wheel cleaner or our tire cleaner and basically
this is just an all purpose cleaner used for
cleaning any kind of surface area. I'm going
to take my brush, tire brush, and just brush
my cleaner into there. You see the suds start
to foam and also get the wheels because a
lot of your road dust accumulates on your
wheels and continue to brush and sometimes
if the cleaner starts to dry you'll hit it
again with your sprayer and make sure you
get around the lug nuts and then just spray
the tire off and you see that your tire is
clean. You will take a microfiber towel and
wipe the towel down, wipe the wheel area down
and
now what you have is a tire that is clean
from any road dust and you're ready to apply
the tire dressing of your choice.
