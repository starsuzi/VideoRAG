hi I'm Nick Jager and I'm here today to
show you how to make lighted wine
bottles
I have today a drill
four different size drill bits
that drill glass for specific bits for
glass
I have the lights
a glue gun
and of course an empty bottle
with some Crystal film
as well as some safety glasses
when you're ready we'll get started
all right I've put in my smallest glass
drill bit inside the drill
as you can see they progressively get
larger
what I will do is drill my first hole
with the smallest kind of a pilot and
just work my way up to the biggest one I
won't drill all the way through with
this but I'll get pretty close and
that'll allow me to put the lights
inside the bottle
here I have my bottle
laid out and I'm going to take one of my
drill bits
and a rubber mallet
I'm going to find the spot where I want
to start the hole
now I'm going to go a little bit below
the label and I'm using this middle
label number here as my guide to kind of
Center it underneath it
and I'm just going to give it a quick
strike
that little notch
will allow me to put my drill bit and
start the drill drilling process without
that you're going to find that your
drill bit will slide all over the glass
this helps getting you started and we'll
work from there
so with the safety glasses on
and our smallest drill bit we'll begin
Drilling
you want a slow steady speed
so I kind of pull the trigger in just a
hair to get its goal
we've broken through the glass now
and as you can see
not gonna see it all right
once you're through
I'm going to start to pick up
speedwise
again I'm keeping a constant slow speed
I'm not putting much pressure on this
you can feel it starting to chatter you
want to slow up a bit too
you don't want the glass to
get two dragons no breaking for sure
there we're through with the first drill
bit now
and I'm going to move up to our next
side
now that the first hole is through
the
next drill bits will go a little faster
for you
bring that off a little bit as you can
see the first one went through
gave us a nice perfect hole
now we're ready to go
try our second size
and there we're through with the second
drill bit
moving on up to our third
that went a lot faster than the first
one you just got to be a little patient
with that one
and everything that follows
screws that much easier
there we've had our drill bit go through
and now we're going to move on to our
last one
now the last one
is bigger than what it needs to be so
we're not going to go all the way
through with this one we're only going
to give ourselves enough room to put
those lights through
all right
we've gone in a little ways with the
larger drill bit and now we're going to
make sure that our hole is big enough
we're going to take our light lights out
just kind of give it a trial run
if you find the end
foreign
usually goes through pretty easy
but the true test is the second one
which has to have both the chords go
along with it
so we're gonna see right now if I have a
big enough area for that to go through
and
I think we're going to need a little bit
more room to let that manure through so
I'm going to drill some more on this
whatever
I'm gonna try this one more time
see if our hole is big enough now
again the first one goes through fairly
easy
now we're gonna try our second one with
both the cords up by it
and it's through
I'm not going to push it all the way
through because I'm going to clean up
the bottle now before I put the lights
in
so
all right we've cleaned up our bottle
now and we have all the dust and such
off we have our hole that's the size to
fit our lights in
take your string of lights and one thing
I always like to do before I get too far
into this is make sure that they work so
I'm just going to plug these in quick
now we're just going through all that
work I wanted to find out that the
lights don't go on all right we got a
functional Set of Lights so we're ready
to go into the bottle with these
first one slides in fairly well and then
the second one you'll want to align the
cords just such
so you can push it right through
all right we're up to our last one
for the hot glue at this point this is a
completed bottle
um you may have seen uh some of these in
craft and hobby shows
craft fairs
where uh it is just a light inside the
bottle and this would be a done product
but uh I take it a step further and I
put Crystal fill in it
so in order for it not to come out the
bottom I'm going to use a little hot
glue down here at the bottom
in and around the cord to kind of plug
the hole
all right
now that our glue's dried I'm just going
to take this excess off here
[Music]
that takes care of the back
now we're ready
to put in the crystal fill uh the
crystal fill is an option that I use and
again
and isn't necessary but uh we're open to
other suggestions that you might want to
incorporate with uh your bottle
um we've been toying with the idea of
Christmas tinsel and putting that in as
well
all right
there
you have it
and I'll put our cork in
and that is a finished product
well if you have any questions or
comments please uh feel free to
