hi and welcome to another providing
resources for emergency preparedness
YouTube video it's a little cloudy
outside and it's a little gloomy out on
this nice summer day but we're going to
brighten things up by making some
homemade chocolate chip cookies
chocolate chip cookies is one of the
easiest basic baking recipes you can
make for you your family it's simple
it's easy it's quick and it's fun to put
together so let's get
started as usual we're going to go
through our ingredients and I'm going to
give you um a shot of what we need to
get us started today our first
ingredient is going to be pure
granulated white sugar you're also going
to need some brown sugar unbleach
allpurpose
flour you're going to need organic eggs
large organic eggs three sticks of
unsalted butter that are room
temperature
you're going to need some chocolate
chips which I have back here baking
soda some good quality vanilla extract
and kosher
salt for Hardware you're going to
need two cookie cheese lined with
parchment paper you're going to need
some type of disher or scooper or a
spoon if you don't have up
school you're going to need as always
when you're baking with me you're going
to need a a SI and a
bowl measuring cup a scraper as usual
I'm attach my bowl and my paddle to my
kitchen a stand mixer but you can also
use a hand mixer if you have one but I
want to talk to you about baking
laziness when you are making these
baking dishes and you follow along with
providing resources for emergency
preparedness and you want to do our
basic baking videos I encourage you not
to be la easy in your baking follows the
instructions scoop out the flour and
cream the butter if you're going to use
the cream butter method and you're going
to use a hand mixer I do want you to
stand there for the 5 minutes it takes
to build up that volume with the hand
mixer you get that volume quicker using
the stand mixer and plus you can also
sift your flour while you use the stand
mixer but if you have a hand mixer this
recipe will work just fine you just have
to stand there and give that up uh
butter and sugar time to work together
to cream together so don't be lazy when
baking because the results will be well
worth the extra 5
minutes so let's get started baking our
cookies today like everything I do
anytime I bake I start every recipe out
with turning on my oven first and I'm
going to set my oven at
375 375Â° I'm going to get that preheated
I'm also going to ask you to turn your
light on because you're definitely going
to need to keep an eye on your cookies
next we're going to start our dish by
getting our butter and our sugar
creaming in our
mixes like I said you can do this by
hand if you have a hand mixer as
well so we have our uh padal attachment
fix to our kitchen a sand mixer and I
want to start by adding the three sticks
of softened butter to the mixer and you
definitely don't want to try to do this
with um butter that is not
softened you want to take the time to
let that butter come up to room
temperature and you don't want to rush
the process by putting it in the
microwave that's a quick and lazy way to
uh ruin these uh
cookies so just let it sit out at room
temperature and then when you're ready
to bake you start
baking all right so that's three sticks
and remember I told you in the earlier
video If you're not a fan of butter this
is not the channel for you to watch so I
have in here my three cups of butter
next I'm going to put in here my 1 and
1/4 cups of sugar so I'm getting my
sugar my cup measures I'm going to start
with my four cup and like always I
advise against the scooping method so
you want to just lightly spoon your
sugar
into your measuring cup top twice level
off
add and then next I want to go with the
one cup
measure and I'm just going to spoon that
in taste the time no
shortcuts because it will produce a
better result
no lazy
bacon okay level that off and add that
in
okay and I've already measured out 1 and
1/4 cup of brown
sugar so I'm going to clean that
up and I'mma start this put my lid down
and I'm going to get this out the way
real
quick I'm going to start this by locking
it and I'm going to put it on stir just
to get it
together which is
one all right and you want to give that
butter and sugar time to work together
to incorporate cuz that will make a nice
fluffier softer cookie because we're not
doing the thin and crispy cookies we're
actually doing the soft and fluffy
cookie so now that it's together and
it's not going to fly up I'm going to
increase the speed and I'm going to put
it on
four all right so it's on four and I'm
going to let that work and I'm going to
go over here and get my flour
together I want to get our dry
ingredients together while our sugar and
our butter are CLE creaming
together so next I want to get my flour
baking soda and my salt chied together
like I always do so you definitely want
to bowl with a
S and you want four cups of allpurpose
flour like I say in every single video I
want you to scoop the flour into your
dish into your
cup tap twice
level that's one
cup
two cup and I always get flour over my
hands but that's okay that's
bacon that's our third cup now here our
butter and sugar over there in the
background whirling
away and our last cup will be four
cup overfill as usual tap twice level
off put that in
there all righty we're done with our
flour and this is always unbleached off
purpose flour or I use wheat if I grind
some up I haven't been grinding any up
lately but I'll get into the habit of
doing that all right next we need 2
tpoon of uh fresh baking soda so I'm
going to get in here and I'mma fluff it
up I'mma to level it off that's
one and that's
two so that's our baking soda this
recipe is really easy to come
together and the next ingredient we need
is a half a teaspoon of kosher
salt and the salt is always kosher
okay so all we have in here is four cups
um bleach all purpose
flour 2 teaspoon of baking soda half a
teaspoon of poer salt and we're going to
FP as usual I leave my bowl steady I
leave my hand steady and I bring the
sifter to my
hand and I sitp and I take my time so it
doesn't go all over the kitchen all over
the bowl all over the
house and when we get to the end that's
what we don't want I toss that
up now that's all of our flour baking
soda and salt so we're going to come
back over here and we're going to strap
down our
Bowl now as you can see I'mma turn this
off look at the
volume that you get when you use the
stand mixer now this goes back to what I
was telling you ladies in the beginning
about lazy bacon when you mix this by
hand with your hand mixer I do want you
to take the time to get this type of
volume in your butter and sugar you can
do it with the hand mixer you just need
to stand there and stir it around until
you get the volume you can do it it just
takes a little longer and it's it's
about 3 4 minutes longer so don't take
the lazy route and try to do without
building up the volume and if your but
but is at room temperature you'll reach
this volume very easy because this is a
soft and fluffy cookie D makees your
cookies chewy so I scraped my bowl
down I've gotten under there and I'm
just going to put this back on for a few
minutes and turn it up a
bit all
right
okay and while that's turning I'm going
to add a few more
ingredients as you can see the volume is
built up really well and I also have my
room eggs at room temperature so I'm
going to add those now one egg at a
time that's one
egg that's two
eggs and I'm going to let each egg
incorporate
and that's three
EGS perfect I'mma turn that
off and I'm going to scrape that down
I'mma lift up my
lid and I see I need to do an adjustment
on my stand mixer so that my beater is
cleaning my bowl and I will do that
after I'm done
okay so we're going to scrape that down
and we're going to let it work in a
little bit
more
okay see how fluffy and light that is so
you're going to get almost a puffy
cookie
though all right so next I'm going to
add
I'mma put this down I'mma add two
teaspoon of vanilla extract and you want
to use a good quality vanilla
extract I talk about this all the time
but I use peny pure vanilla extract I'm
wipe my bottle off pin's vanilla extract
is really good it's a quality vanilla
extract it's not the fake Uh Wood type
extract that you buy at the grocery
store and if this bottle wasn't dark you
would be able to see that uh piny puts a
actual vanilla bean in the bottle so
that you always get that freshness of
the vanilla so I got my 2 tpoon of
vanilla extract in here so I'm going to
give this a little whirl
again and we're almost done so I'mma
scrape that
down
you see how fluffy that is it's almost
pillowy okay I'm going to scrape that
off the
beers get that in
there
okay all righty so I'm just going to let
that swirl one more time and then I'm
going to get my flour and start adding
my flour a little at a time so I'm going
to let that beat up a second
good enough that's
it I'mma scrape some of this down so I
can actually get my flour in the bowl
all righty so now I'm going grab my
flour from over here and this is a flour
mixture so what I'mma to do is I'mma use
my spatula to help me out and I'm going
to add about a four of the
flour
and I'm going work it in and I'm going
put it on one as you can see it jumps
out so you definitely don't want to stir
it on
high okay lift that
up scrape it
down
okay sorry about
that I can have that
out all right and I'm going add my
next fourth
okay put it on low put it on
one
okay okay scrape it down one more
time as you can see I'm mixing up very
little it doesn't take a lot cuz like I
said I want light fluffy dough start it
on one
again there we
go okay that's good and now for my last
last installation of
flour then we can add the chocolate
chips and we're ready to go all right my
last bit of
flour
okay I'll get rid of that in the
sink put that down starting on
low okay now I'm just going to lift this
up real
quick okay try to get some of that off
of
there gives us a lot of cookie
dough my daughter loves this
recipe
because she gets a lot of
cookies all
righty okay and I'm going to go in here
and scrape this down one more time okay
then I'm going to give it a little whirl
and then I'mma
add the chocolate
chips our last and final and you can add
nuts you can add chocolate chips you can
add whatever you want at this point for
your cookie
though you can add M&M sprinkles
whatever suits your
fancy
okay okay so this is my last worldl this
is my last
worldl 5 4 3 2 1 about 10 seconds so now
I'm going to add my chocolate
chips and that's about two
cups and I'm just going to th them
in
okay I'm going to lift it up scrape it
down and then I'mma to take the rest by
hand
okay so we just scrape all this off as
much as we can cuz we want as much to go
in the oven as
possible
okay okay get it from this side and I
think we're all scraped
off okay so I'm going to work with what
I got here so now I'm going to take my
cookie dough off and I'm going come back
over
here and I'mma stick this right here and
clean up for a the video a bit cuz I
wanted to wash my hands cuz I have flour
all over them but then I'm going to come
back and I'm just going to finish
folding the chips in and if you you know
you want a lot of chocolate chips you
can add more you can add nuts at this
time if you want to add some peanut
butter chips or butterscotch chips you
can do it at that time but look at this
dough see how fluffy and pillowy it is
that's perfect chocolate chip cookie
dough for the fluffy soft chewy type of
cookies we're getting ready to make so I
have my two dishes here both of them
covered with parchment
paper and even if I didn't use the
parchment paper these are
nonstick uh trays anyway but I like the
parsing paper cuz it's easier to take
the cookies off after they bake to cool
down so so I got my scooper here and I'm
going to get in here and as you can see
all the chocolate chips throughout I'm
going to go in here and I'm going to
scoop up
and and uh even off and I'm just going
to place a scoop on the
paper
perfect even off scoop on the
paper
right
and these will give you some nice size
cookies okay that's one
tray second
tray even off
way too much on that one so you
definitely want to even off and that's
when using a scoop makes it nicer to
work
with
okay all
righty so I think that's enough for the
first
round and I'm going to get this in the
oven at 3 3
75Â° now I want to tell you bake these
from 8 to 10 minutes but I'm not going
to tell you that I'm going to tell you
to bake these from 8 to 10 minutes but
watch them because each oven is
different it you know some people have
the convections oven that circulate the
air some people have a basic oven like I
do so you want to make sure that you're
paying attention to your cookies that's
why I had you turn the light on at the
beginning if you have one also invest in
a good kitchen timer sometimes times
when I'm you know cleaning up my kitchen
after I didn't made my mess making my
cookies I get distracted so you want to
set your timer for um the uh 7 to 8
minutes and at at uh 7 minutes you want
your timer to go off so you can start
looking at your cookies cuz you don't
want your cookies to overbake you won't
get soft chewy cookies you'll get hard
crispy cookies so I'm going to set my
timer for 7 minutes and get started my
oven is clean
and halfway through this process I'm
going come back and rotate my
pan cuz my oven does bake
uneven all right we're going to let
those cookies bake up uh halfway through
I'm going to come back and rotate my uh
pans top to bottom back to front and
then we're going to come back and um
load up more cookies and clean up this
mess and we'll show you how everything
turns out we'll be back so we're back
our cookies are good and baked it's been
about 7 to 8 minutes I'm going to take
them out so they they don't overbake
you're going to notice that they're very
puffy but as they sit and cool they're
going to collapse and become normal
toic so I'm going to take them out
now and as you can
see the edges are golden
brown but we don't want the centers to
be golden brown so we're going to let
those sit a second let them sit and as
you see they're nice and puffy
as they sit they're going to collapse
down and become normal cookies these
have already started that process then
we're going to use our spatula to take
them off transfer them here we're going
to load up more cookies all right we're
going to use this to lift up our
cookies to the cooling
racks and the These are nice fluffy soft
chewy
cookies and they smell awesome I wish
you guys had smell of vision or smell of
YouTube but as you can see they look
awesome
okay so that's my first
set all
ready so
now I'm ready to start loading up my
second set and like before I'mma even
off and place on the
tray and I'm using this side scoop cuz I
don't want baby cookies I actually want
cookie
cookies all
righty
get these loaded up a second
time you want to scrape off the
excess okay that's one
tray
okay the last
one okay so we're going to grab our oven
mi get this second B in the
oven all right I'm going to reset my
timer for 78
minutes and we'll be back when this
batch is done so we're halfway through
the cooking time on our second batch
we're going to take our pan make the
tops the bottom and the bottoms the
top
okay all right so so we rotated our
second batch we'll be back show you
how all right so our second batch of
cookies are ready to come
out they're brown around the edges but
not in the center and as you can see
they're nice and
puffy and like before we're going to
give those a minute to cool
down and then we're going to come back
and take them off and put them to our
cooling rack as you can see these have
cooled down a bit and you can start to
see the chocolate chips start to pop up
we'll be back in a minute to Dean these
and get our last batch yet so we're back
again and our second Bas cookies have
had a moment to sit and relax we're
going to depend those and get into our
cooling
rack and I've kind of shifted the other
ones to the side to make room for
these this recipe is easy easy to make
so I hope you and your family try to
make it it's also a fun me recipe to
make with the
kids ready almost done
here okay so that's our second batch all
right so we had three more um room for
three more cookies and our last of our
batter I put them on the same parchment
paper I'm want to throw these in the
oven 78 minutes and we'll be
back we're back once again our third
batch of cookies are done um they're
brown around the edges we're going to
take them out the
oven
smell all
right okay all right so that's our third
B of cookies we're going to let that
batch cool down we're going to add them
to the um cooling rack and we'll be
right back all right so this is our last
batch of cookie we're going to get those
on the cooling rack I'm actually going
to lay those
flat all righty and as you can see here

chip cookies if you wanted to go with a
smaller scoop and reduce the size you
can cut these in have you can get a lot
more cookies so this is our chocolate
