what's up you guys my name is aenai and
welcome back to another video today I'm
going to teach you guys how to make
prison moonshine now I've never done
this before but I have on good
information that this is how it's made
obviously cuz you can make it a prison
the ingredients are really easy and
simple to get some
oranges cup of sugar a jar a tin
whatever that you can put a lid on make
it airtight and some water really Simple
Start half fill it with water pour in
some sugar and then you want to get
oranges and you want to either peel them
or bite into them so I'm going to bite
into them cuz this is the part they do
in prison so like just I'll do T them in
half m [ __ ] love
[Music]
oranges I'm aware I could have cut them
but what I do is the prism weight
so lid on give it a nice vigorous Shake
If I put the lid on correctly that is
there we go it's on proper now why is it
still leaking do one
leak oh I got a leaky jar I think yeah
we do we have a leaky jar I'm going to
swap this right so I've given a really
nice vigorous Shake now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to leave this in the
cupboard next to me for 7 days and just
not touch it not open the cupboard
supposed to leave it in like a cool uh
sorry warm dry and like dark place and
then apparently it ferments so let's do
that right here we are here is our
finished
product I'm going to smell it
first okay certainly smells interesting
and yeah let's just like usually what
they do in prison is they get like a
sock or like if they get like tight so
thumbs in and then just stick it and
then squeeze it through that I'm not
going to do that because one I'd have to
go buy a pair of tights which you know I
don't want to do and uh or two I'd have
to use one of my socks and I don't have
any clean new socks it's all like socks
I've worn so we're not going to do it
that way I've just got a coffee filler
and I'm just going to try and strain
just a a wee bit through and see if I
can have a taste from
that
okay that should
do should be enough for me to
uh have a nice we shot of it certainly
smells interesting it smells like it
could be
[Music]
alcoholic here we go I
[Music]
guess okay it tastes [ __ ]
disgusting but there is a hint of like
booziness there I can feel the burn as
if it's alcoholic it's probably not that
strong it's probably only like I don't
know 20 not even 20% it's probably like
10% of less left this for 6 days I
reckon if I left it for a
month it might actually be a bit
stronger but if you guys want to try
this at home make sure you drink
responsibly anyway guys hope you have
