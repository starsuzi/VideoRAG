hi folks george davis with stone
brothers and bird
a
common problem or not really a problem
but a problem area uh this time of year
that we find
is in low
wet damp areas especially grassed areas
that might be more frequent with traffic
such as mowing
there is a an insect called a solitary
or digger wasp
that looks very much like a hornet
and a lot of people bring these things
in they'll catch them in a jar and bring
them in i don't know what they are what
kind of hornet it is and it's really not
a hornet it's a wasp
it's identified as is having a large
yellow
body on the back end with stripes around
it looks like a like a an enlarged
yellow jacket
the
the solitary
solitary or digger wasp actually digs
into the mud
and will create about a pencil-sized
hole in the ground with raised dirt
above it
and they'll be in mass normally in these
areas
as ruled solitary by name
doesn't bother you if you don't bother
him
they can sting and they can they can
really uh sting hard but normally
they're they're not aggravated unless
something like a lawnmower goes over
them and then it can be problems
uh where there is an area that you need
to uh rid yourself of this this
situation
we strongly urge you to again at night
preferably at dark when just as the
wasps
are in the holes to go out with this
bifenthrin product this is granular
bifenthrin product and very liberally
coat this area
uh so that this stuff will will get down
into the holes
that and then get away the next morning
dues will have activated this chemical
or maybe even a rain shower might have
activated the uh chemical and it should
take care of the problem
by fentanyl and granule we have in in
our walk-in location as well as online
can ship it to you
and
eliminate your problem
