today we're going to do a shot called a
duck fart who named that one anyway it's
a warm shot I'm gonna start off with the
shot glass I'm going to add a two count
of Baileys
I'm going to add a two count of Kahlua
I'm gonna float on the top here a crown
Canadian whiskey
kind of looks like what I would imagine
a duck fart looks like huh
