hey guys so I'm going to grind some beef
for to make some hamburgers for lunch so
I figured I would show you how to use my
kitchen a grinder it took me a little
bit of figuring out to know how to do it
so the parts are first this is where the
food goes in it's got a hollow hole
through there it comes out on this
end and then got this cork screw that
pushes rotates attaches to the motor and
it pushes the meat through the
grinder so you just put this in here
like
so the next piece that goes on is this
Cog reel you can think it's actually the
blade for the meat grinder and it goes
directly on top of the cork
screw there
fits on perfectly like a puzzle
piece next piece is the meat grinding
plate I believe this is the coar grind
you've got a couple different plates you
can choose from but mine came with a
coar grinder so that goes right on top
of the cutting
[Music]
plate it doesn't matter which way it
goes it'll fit on both ways and then the
last one you have is the cap that goes
on top of the horse grinding plate that
just screws on
there you go you got it all set up and
ready to go let see the cork screw
through the bottom there where the meat
will be pushed through and it comes out
through this end this end attaches to
your kitchen aid and I'll show you it
put all together I want to do is to take
the screw off of the KitchenAid
decorative plate take that off
there
your meat
grinder all right and then you're going
to put the screw back in place to hold
the meat
grinder make sure it's in there tight
because when the motor's running it can
become loose all right so
that that attaches there on like that
and and I'll show you uh the kind of
meat that I use a helpful tip is to put
the meat in the freezer for about 10
minutes just so it gets a little bit
firm it makes it easier to cut and when
it grinds through it won't gum up in
your food processor so let me grab my
meat all right so I've got a pound and a
half of top cine steak and half a pound
of meat loin top
loin uh I like to get meat that has a
little bit bit of fat in it I'm not
going to use all of this fat because
it'll be too fatty but when you're
making hamburgers you want to have some
fat or else your burger will be too dry
so I'm just going to cube this up and
trim off a bit of the
fat I'm just finishing up cutting up my
meat and I just want to point out when
you're looking for what kind of beef to
grind you want something that has good
marbling like that it's pretty good you
got good fat content throughout the meat
now just cutting in about 1 in squares
here and we don't I just want to point
out we don't eat beef a lot in fact we
hardly eat it maybe every couple months
or so I think a little bit of red meat
is okay it's good for the iron but um if
I'm going to eat especially ground meat
I get really weird I don't like pre
ground meat because I don't know what's
in it and I feel better just grinding it
myself and it takes a second so it's a
lot easier to do and you get a whole lot
more meat for your money grinding it
yourself you could just you know spend
the whole day grind a bunch of meat and
how fun is it to grind meat I mean it's
super fun all right so I got my cubed
meat here I'm going
to back up my kitchen
aid back it on it put your bowl put it
kind of close to the uh grinder or else
you get meat splatted and that's kind of
gross so kind of stuff your meat in
there and I don't have my
meat Pusher so I'm going to use a
chopstick
right and you just turn it on slow at
first and then I go up to
medium take a couple seconds for it to
get
going you just push it with your
tool there you go meat comes out nice
nice grind medium
medium dry is really
good all right and this is how much meat
um 2 lbs of meat that I bought and made
it just it's really nice and loose so
it's it makes really good hamburgers so
I also want to point out that when
you're done at the end of the grinder a
good way to clean it out is you could
stick a couple pieces of bread this
regular untoasted bread through there
and it'll help push everything else out
and keep it nice and clean so I like
hand wash these things cuz I don't feel
like dishwashers really do that great of
a job and it's not good for the metal
components so always hand wash your
expensive attachments that's my point
and so I'm just going to put some salt
pepper garlic powder nothing crazy I
just like you know a good piece of meat
for the flavor to come through I'm make
some burgers and fry them out for lunch
I hope all right and this is the
finished product this is our Lunch
today's homemade ground hamburger with
some homemade spicy pickles a lovely
tomato and some grilled asparagus and
grilled rade salad with grilled lemon
yeah we grilled everything today woohoo
definitely worth the
effort
