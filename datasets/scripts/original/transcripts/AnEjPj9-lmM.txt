hello Namaste salum srial welcome back
to another session with your wasf
ata.com today we're going to make chi
Cod CH Ka Suka baji now you know I have
taken a little more oil you know that's
how they prefer it with little bit oil
floating on top but you can always add
little less oil than what I'm showing
here in the hot oil add mustard seeds
when the splutter add cumin
seeds
Okay in this add chopped
onion now you can see this onion is uh
slightly golden in color add salt and
ginger garlic paste and also add
Hing few pieces of uh chopped tomato you
know I've removed the seeds first add
some turmeric and mix
it now add coriander powder chili
powder Okay add very little
water in this add
lobia that is a blacke
piece now now here add some chopped
coriander okay now the dish is all
ready
ha you know adding these tomatoes and
other thing has made it little bit uh
you know juicy juicy yet it's not really
sauce it's slightly you know thick sauce
you can see that the blacke piece is
more than the sauce in a lot of
restaurants and especially in the
caterings they add oil in which they add
these masalas after which you can see
this red oil floating but if you're very
calorie conscious just add half a
teaspoon of oil and still you can make
this dish but it will taste slightly
different and it won't have that
richness so dear friends you can see
this oil floating okay now switch off
the flame and this is ready to be served
very nice
Aroma dear friends I hope you enjoyed

this dish with your wash off but
