what I'm going to do here
is I've got my Springs pulled in on the
spring clips now I'm going to close
these spring clips top of a hammer you
can either close the spring clips using
a frame gun or by inch wire
Nails just top in with a
hammer and I'm go use the frame gun it's
about quicker
[Music]
and that's the the same on the back
using your frame gum make sure you Mir
uh your safety glasses for that so I'm
going to go ahead and put home all the
Springs okay now that my Springs are all
fixed what I'm going to do is put a
piece of uh old cloth any fabric have L
around over that just to give a bit of
protection to the the foam and a bit of
extra support so tacking it in the back
Rael then I'm going to over here
I I have a gap here so I'm going to
bring this right down the
bottom and our next step is we're going
to cut off that x s
fabric I'm going to tack that dinos
sides are too and then we're going to
put a piece of foam on
there right now I have my inch foam
which going close to the S so centralize
it
again and push
it and on the
back going to make a couple of
cuts towards the front of the arm
Tu that down on your
sides and next we're going to tack that
on the bottom and around the
sides okay now I have my my seat ped up
I decided to put an extra about an inch
underneath there just to give a little
bit more pom cuz I'm not going to put
cushions on this one so I'm going to
tack it at the
back back
wheel slight stream
I'm tacking it on the front I'm going to
put a front border on this
so put a couple of to stles the center
going to Str it out to the
side there's a good stretch in this
fabric
same on
other now I'm just going to tack each
end here and Tack around the sides by
putting a plate in here like so so I'll
carry on with
that the next step is to put my front
border on here the pipe front border so
I'm going to measure from the bottom
rail
to here and I'm going to mark this
up 6 and 1 half
Ines and also s in the
sides of
already cut and showed the the B
so I'm going to
put little cut in the
center and I got to measure the center
of the
sofa so we're not going to end up short
on one of the sides
so going
to put my paping line it up with my
chalk
Mark I'll put a tack in that slight
strain and do the same on the other
side next I'm going to bring it around
the
corner slight straight once more
see on this
side I just got to
put a few tacks just to pull it in
place next I'm going to use a piece of
back Tack and strip cardboard back
tacking strip and place that along lined
up with SE and
L okay that's now that's done over a
cardboard back HCK and
strip tacked here next stage is to put a
piece of foam which we're going to use
for our front B can be inch half inch
and what we want to do is nip it
around in here on the foam we're going
to attack that the whole way around and
around the corners
[Applause]
okay so now I have the the foam in place
sometimes it's a good idea to p a piece
of plastic an old carrier bag or
something around the corners it helps it
pull down more smoothly in the Press
we're going to put a really good strain
in this front water and Tack that after
that so outside arms and outside back
okay now I'm just going to finish around
the corner a good
strand got a NE
plate in the
corner and
ping TR looking strip
and
that's front
water my next stage is the outside arms
which we going to back
Tack okay managed to back tack my
outside arm
here to the Ping
sometimes you could back tag it at the
top put a m strip down there but I'm
just going to back tag I've back taged
it here I'm just going to tack up here
where it can't be
seen I'm going to put a little bit
of backr on
this it helps soften
it your R
covers you can see that's B
Etc I'm going to give a strand this to
the back
first I'm just putting temp tax in it
moment
it looks
fine strin that Tar It Well
back
next I'm going to attack this up under
the
arm and then we're going to attack and
put out any string to the
bottom okay my outside arms are now
completely attacked next is Ed as your
rightside back so it's the same thing
again couple of tampering Staples and
then put your
cardboard back Tack and
STP secure it
[Music]
okay my cardboard backtack and strips
can I put on I'm going to put it again
piece of D on you don't have to do
this but it makes for much better
job it gives a better finish
okay
next we're going to strain the outside
back up
so few temporary tacks in the center and
then work your way out
till either side
then put them between
it now all you have to do with this is
finish the
sides okay the last thing to do with a
right shade back is put I'm going to use
this metal strip
here you have to be careful this you
don't cut your fingers
so we're going to set
Place put your fabric
through
spikes
or use your
scissors because this really can't stick
into
you okay next get a mallet I put a bit
of leather around this here to protect
the
fabric turn your fabric around and twist
it put a slight strain on it
just work your way
down and that goes for a NE neat finish
last thing to do with this here is put
our dust cloth on it our bottom cloth
okay last thing to do here is tack on
our dust
cloth make sure you have your inside
arms and your seat the inside of the arm
here all secured intact good tip is also
to put a little piece of
foam on the tops of your arms so it
doesn't scuff or mark it if it's a
recover make sure you always brush down
your bench make sure there's no loose
Staples or anything there cuz they can
damage your fabric make sure your holes
are all clear for your casters or your
feet stumps whatever you're going to
use okay
trying to keep it back a little bit from
the front edge back Edge and sides so
you're not going to see the dust cloth
trying to use a dark dust cloth
[Applause]
okay I'll just continue finishing that
off and then and you're going to mark
your holes make a hole here for your
stumps and cers to go
through okay last is your stumps
card whatever you're putting
on get those home
and that is Su for complete
