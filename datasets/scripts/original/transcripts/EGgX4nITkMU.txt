today I'm going to use this product one
of these engine no leaks and I thought I
would actually film the whole process in
case anybody else is having this problem
what I did is well what I did I put a
new engine in my car 3 years ago and now
it's leaking oil around my heads not my
main seal but around my heads I don't
really feel like taking an engine out
putting a new one in I don't feel like
do putting on a new head gasket I just
don't feel like doing that so I said uh
I'm going try one of these engine no
leaks so this particular one
is this particular one is called No leak
from a company Gold Eagle they're also
from the mother company
stable it says engine oil stop leak stop
leak repairs uh rear main seal even
though I don't have a rear main seal
that's what the bottle says I don't know
if you can see it so I'll just read what
the back says no leak quickly stops
engine oil leaks including rear main
seal leaks and helps replace lost fluid
our proprietary stop leak formula Works
effectively with all types of motor oils
including synthetics and all gasoline
and diesel engines treats up to five
quartz 4.7 L of oil their directions are
simple simple you turn off vehicle
engine allow to cool remove oil filler
cap replace I'm sorry pour contents of
bottle into oil reservoir do not
overfill replace filler cap leak should
stop within 200 miles of driving if
leaks continue repairs may be
necessary so that's what the bot says
again this is no
leak from Gold Eagle
so what I'm going to do I'm going to
follow the directions but before I do
that I'm going to actually show you what
the leak on my car looks like right now
I have it uh jacked up on some ramps I'm
going show you the leak all up under it
then I'm going to use my pressure washer
clean it all put this in go for 200
miles and then show you what it looks
like after 200 miles okay here's my
vehicle on some stands you really can't
see any leaks from the top so I'm just
going to go straight to the
bottom okay now I'm under directly B the
engine this is the uh
transmission Bell house and you can see
that there's a lot of oil right here you
can see on the uh transmission pan cover
with oil you can see on the starter oil
is all around the starter on this
side sorry about that on this side there
is the oil filter housing and there's
oil all around
that now I don't have an issue with the
rear main seal I don't know if you can
see up in there but I don't have an
issue with it leaking there here's my
oil plug don't have an issue with it
there it's the head gasket so like I
said I'm going to clean all this off of
water with my pressure washer I'm going
to use the no
leak Drive 200 miles and then we're
going to come back and take a look oh
it's also leaking up here in the
front right behind the harmonic bance
okay I just got done spraying the uh
under the engine with the pressure
washer and by the way when I did the
spring I put a tarp down because you
don't want oil all on your driveway plus
you don't want it going into the gutters
so yeah put a tarp down or something
okay here is the starter uh cleaned it
off here's the transmission pan here's
the bell housing so pretty much I don't
see oil
anywhere I about to drop this stuff in
the engine go 200 miles and then uh
we'll come back and see so oh yeah by
the way on my starter because there was
so much oil up in there it was slipping
when it was trying to crank the engine
and I notice every time I clean it the
um car starts a little little faster you
just a side okay
so simply going to take it
and pour all of it in like they
said I pour stuff
in just going to pour it all
in not that it matters but it's like a
pretty blue purple
color that means absolutely nothing
all
right go ahead and pour that in go ahead
and reset the
trip there
144 now it says zero so when that hits
200 I'll be right I just reset the trip
so I'm going to go drive 200 Mi probably
200 MI was offroading in some dirt
somewhere and when I get done when it
hits 200 mil I'll be back I'll record it
and we'll go from
there hopefully this stuff works this no
leak this Gold Eagle no
leak okay I'm back now I went a little
more than 200 Mi 213 so now I have the
car jacked up uh let's go ahead and take
a look at it
so as you see there's one drop of oil
right here on the ground but I will say
I've had the vehicle in this suspended
position for about 10 minutes
and before that would have been a lot of
oil now here's the bail
house there's the bail
house and here's the
starter I will say it's a
considerable less amount of oil there's
a
transmission and some of this oil could
be here from you know before the uh stop
leak actually had a chance to work so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
clean it off with the water let it dry
and then drive a few more miles come
back and see what it looks like but from
what I'm seeing right now I would say
that the stop leak has definitely
definitely had a huge impact because
there's not as much oil as I would
normally see so yeah let me go ahead and
clean this off and then uh I'll come
back and show you
before I go ahead and rinse it off
here's the oil housing which used to
have a lot of oil by it it still has oil
but not as much as it did so like I said
I think the stop leak has definitely
done
something and I'm clean it off and uh
see what it looks like after it D okay
as you can see I went and drove almost
10 Mi more uh I left the water dry and
let's see what it looks like
now now it's a little bit steel right
there it's a little right there but
nothing is on the
transmission the starter
the starter does have a little bit of
oil and
then on
the oil filter side I don't see anything
so it didn't stop it completely but it
made a huge huge
difference so I'm happy even though it
didn't stop it
completely here is the can I mean here's
the bottle one last time
It's Gold Eagle no leak engine oil stop
leak by stable my recommendations it
didn't completely stop the oil leak
entirely but it stopped at 90
plus% and for that I like it I would
recommend it and I'm going to continue
to use it hopefully I don't have to but
if I ever get a leak on another vehicle
I will use this stuff so I hope that
helps somebody uh if you have any
questions feel free to hit me up and I
will answer them as fast as possible so
you guys have a good day and as usual I
appreciate you watching and thank you
