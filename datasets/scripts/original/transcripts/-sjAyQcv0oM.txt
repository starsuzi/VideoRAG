AND UNLIKE THE REGULAR SEASON, 
THIS GAME CAN NOT END IN A TIE.
WE CAN BE HERE UNTIL A WEEK FROM
TUESDAY.
>> Referee: OVERTIME IN THE 
POSTSEASON.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY UNTIL 
WE DETERMINE A WINNER.
BOTH TEAMS WILL HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO POSSESS THE BALL.
FIRST TEAM ON OFFENSE SCORES A 
TOUCHDOWN OR THERE'S A DEFENSIVE
SCORE.
EACH TEAM IS GOING TO HAVE THREE
TIME-OUTS PER HALF.
AND ALL OF THE REPLAYS HAVE TO 
BE HANDLED UPSTAIRS.
GOOD?
OKAY.
AGAIN, THE SHIELD SIDE IS HEADS.
THE TAILS IS THE CALL.
TAILS IS THE CALL.
>> WE WANT THE CALL.
>> Referee: IT DIDN'T FLIP.
IT DIDN'T FLIP.
>> Al: PLEASE.
>> Referee: YOU'LL TAKE THE 
BALL.
SO, CROSBY, TO PUT THE BALL IN 
THE AIR.
AND NELSON WILL TAKE IT AND TAKE
A KNEE IN THE END ZONE.
