hello today we're going to show you how
to wash this car by hand because wash it
by hand you can do a really good job and
to we're trying to show you how you can
do some of these things from your home
you know kind of do it yourself type
thing so uh I mean this is real basic
but we're just going to go over and go
through the steps to get a nice clean
car the first thing you want to do is
rinse the car off real good and start
from the top and work your way toward
the bottom
now that we got our carbon stuff we're
going to clean our mint and our bucket
off so these can be clean uh if you've
seen us working on the Mustang we were
getting ready to paint so we
used dis sh to take away all the wax
however on this car we're not going to
paint so we're going to use car so
in order I mean to protect the
wax now um we're going to clean under
the hood and clean the jams
it's really a good idea to use a
different mitt and wash bucket because
you don't want to get that dirt mixed in
with your clean
water we're going to do the inside and
get the interior and clean
it to help clean the tires we're going
to use Tire cleaner we have to be really
really careful because this can't get on
aluminum right here or it would stain it
could stain
when washing we want to start at the top
and work our way down to the
bottom here's a little tip for you using
a low pressure will cut your drying time
on your final
rinse for
