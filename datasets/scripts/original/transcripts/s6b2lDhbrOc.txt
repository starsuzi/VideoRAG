In this video you will learn how to
align the Fresh Food doors
on your bottom freezer unit.
If the tops of the fresh food doors are uneven,
there are two methods of correction.
First, begin by adjusting the leveling
leg of the lowest door.
The leveling legs are located on the
bottom front the unit.
Adjust the leg by turning until the
doors are even.
If after the adjustment, the unit is not
stable,
re-adjust the leveling legs until the
unit is balanced
and has firm contact with the floor.
If the doors remain uneven, try the
second method.
You will need a quarter-inch allen
wrench to complete this portion of the video.
Begin by locating the adjustable pin.
The adjustable pin location varies by
model.
The pin is located on the door that does
not contain the water dispenser.
If you have either a 21 cubic foot or 15 cubic foot unit
without a dispenser on the door,
the adjustable pin will be located on
the left side door.
If you have either a 20 cubic foot for 22
cubic
foot unit without dispenser on the door, the
adjustable pen will be located on the
right side door.
For example, if the water dispenser is on
the right
fresh food door, the adjustable pin will be
located
on the bottom of the left fresh food door.
Using a quarter-inch allen wrench,
turn the adjustable pin
to raise or lower the door until both
fresh food doors are aligned.
CAUTION:
Be careful not to screw the pin out at the
hinge because the door
may fall off the hinges.
