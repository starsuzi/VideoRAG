hi we're in the kitchen of the Gray
Goose Gourmet and I'm Sandra the owner
and maker of Gray Goose Gourmet pepper
jellies
it is fiddlehead season
and yesterday while I was out and about
doing errands found a gentleman who was
selling them
um on this on the side of the road so
I've got about a pound here and I'm
going to saute these we're going to have
sauteed fiddleheads with my pepper jelly
I'm going to use original today you
could use roasted garlic and onion
roasted squash medley but anyway doing
the original first thing I'm doing
I have rinsed these and I'm going to do
it again the fiddleheads
you want to get all the dirt and the
particles out so I pretty much rinse
these good kind of clean them up a
little bit and the first thing I'm going
to do is take them over to my boiling
water
I just pour them in the water this is
salted boiling water and they'll stay in
here and cook for about
oh seven to eight minutes until they're
just starting to turn tender they boiled
for about seven eight minutes
I'm going to drain them
all right
these are going to be sauteed now I've
got about
about
three tablespoons of extra virgin olive
oil in it
and I am going to
put the fiddleheads in
I'm going to put in about a teaspoon of
minced garlic
and I'm going to put in
my original pepper jelly
I'm going to put in two good heaping
teaspoons
give these a stir
what's nice about the pepper jelly
it's got
cider vinegar in it
and it has sugar in it and of course the
peppers and that with the garlic is
going to make these so delicious
fiddleheads are related to asparagus
but these can also be a little bit
bitter so with a little bit of sugar in
it
from the pepper jelly
and
the cider vinegar you're going to be
yummy
that's a little splatting so you know
what I think what I'll do
to cover them a little with a Splat pan
flat cover there we go
I'm gonna let those do their thing for
about
five six minutes
just checking on the fiddleheads they've
been in about three minutes
and when they're fork tender they're
ready to enjoy
so just checking the fiddleheads again
I'm going to give one A Taste see how
they are doing
seem to be pretty good
if I turn slightly golden brown that's
that's even ideal
oh my gosh
oh this is so good
the fiddleheads are done
and I'm just going to put them into
a serving dish
my sauteed fiddleheads are done and they
look amazing can't wait to have them for
