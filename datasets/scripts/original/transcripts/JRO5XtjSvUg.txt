okay welcome to Kyle's kitchen here
today I'm going to be making watermelon
vodka I never done this before so bear
with me but you get the cap of the
bottle what you're using and you make a
little
circle that's what you got to cut
out okay so we got a little bit of a
circle
here so what I will do now cut around
the
circle is a very important part of the
project now also you can use any type of
booze you really want people just say
regular vodka but I I cressed it up a
little bit you know I like vanilla so I
figured Let's Do Vanilla watermelon cuz
that would be
delicious CU I cut up the hole see a
big
elements perfect simple you can eat it
that is
delicious also don't get a watermelon
with seeds in it it screw everything
out now get your
spoon an empty cup or whatever you like
and you start
scooping scooping some of the watermelon
out you can actually eat it
too
delicious scoop scoop

until you have enough
room use your judgment
now to put the bottle
in and it has to stay in good now it
doesn't really need to be refrigerated
but before you serve it you should at
least refrigerate it up to 3 hours so
it's nice and
cold as we get the watermelon
out perfect that should be
enough for the watermelon to actually
fit
now as you can see I drank a little bit
out of it I had to get a little buzz
going before I made this video all right
and then you have to do it very fast
because you don't want any spillage oh
I'm a little nervous here as you can
see and go for it now we are all done
until 12 hours later we will come back
check it out make sure all the booze has
been infused into the
watermelon and that's about it you can
get that nice and stuck in there so it
doesn't move anywhere and keep it in a
cool
area all righty thank you for watching
