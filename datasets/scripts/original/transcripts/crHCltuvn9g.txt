hi I'm Juliette from spoiled Russian
beads and this week we have been
starting to think a little bit more
about the festive season that's coming
up soon and we've got a lovely project
to show you today
this is beautiful little wine glass
charms I'm going to show you how to make
in a moment they make wonderful gifts
they're brilliant because they're quick
and easy to make so if you're selling
them on your craft store they'll be nice
and easy for you to make and you will be
lovely just to have in your own home as
well if you're having a party people
don't lose their glasses and they know
which one's theirs and they just had a
little fun Christmassy touch to your um
home this Christmas
so to make these lovely little wine
glass charms you're going to need some
0.4 millimeter silver plated wire one of
these little crystal beads here which
make the skirt of the Angel a six
millimeter Pearl a six millimeters
Frosty Crystal Daisy spacer bead and a
wine glass charm and then some size 15
Miyuki seed beads so I've cut myself a
length of wire here that's around about
25 centimeters long the first thing you
need to do is take that wire and thread
on one just one of those size 15 seed
beads and let that seed be fall into the
center of the wire and bring both ends
of the wire together
and then pop them up through the base of
that Crystal bead there
and the seed bead will form a stopper
I'm doing in a moment
I'm going to pull that down
like that
and you can see that that seed bead now
is forming a stopper there and I can
just give it a bit of a tug just to pop
it on the end there and you can see
that's nice and neat it's forming a
stopper and now what I've got is I have
got two pieces of wire coming out of the
top of my crystal bead and we need to
make the wings of the Angel so to do
that you need to thread on 20 of the
size 15 seed beads onto onto one side of
the piece of wire and I've got I've got
how many have I got I've got six on
there now seven eight
10.
10 to 15.
19
20 so I've got 20 size 15 seed beads
there and to make that little ain't that
little wing shape there you bend the
wire around
thank you
like that and then just pinching all the
seed beads out of the way
put a little twist in the wire to hold
that in place
like so
and then on do exactly the same thing on
the other side so again I'm going to
thread on my 20 size 15 seed beads
11.
15.
20.
so I've got 20 on that side there and so
I'm going to do exactly the same thing
I'm going to bend
the wire around to form that Wing shape
grip make sure I've got all of the beads
tucked away out of the way and then just
put a little twist in there to create
that that Wing shape like that there
so I've now got my wing shapes
and what I need to do is just pop the
little head
on the angel there which is going to be
that
six millimeter Pearl so I'm going to
take again both of the ends of the wire
together and pop both of the ends of the
wire up through that Purl bead so I've
got two pieces of wire going through
that pearl bead there and I will slide
that down
like so
[Music]
Taylor one and the Halo of the Angel is
the little Swarovski Crystal bead there
it's going to pop that one on there
so
and then you just need to turn a loop on
the top of that Halo there using around
those pliers so I'm gripping both pieces
of wire with my round nose pliers and
I'm just going to turn a loop on the
very top there
and wrap the ends of that wire around
the base of that Loop then you can see
I've got a nice neat Loop there both
pieces of wire make the same Loop and
then you can use your side Cutters to
trim off the tail of wire that you don't
need anymore
there we go
and at this stage if you want to you can
use your round nose pliers just to pop
into those wings there and just to sort
of neaten up that shape there just
gently so that you don't damage any of
the glass beads make sure you're happy
with the shape and All That Remains now
is just to slip the um
Angel there onto the wine glass charm
and she is all done and ready to be the
star of the show at your Christmas party
thanks for watching
