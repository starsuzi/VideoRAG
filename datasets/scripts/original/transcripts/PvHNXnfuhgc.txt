good morning folks um this is a time of
year whenever drains uh inevitably will
get blocked now this one here routinely
blocks about twice a year um and the
first thing to do to unblock it um
without having to uh bring in uh Prof
the professionals is
simply uh clear all DeBry as much as
possible out of the dra then clear all
uh
excess Ling water out of the drain using
uh various methods I'm using this little
metal uh flask over that is no longer in
use so having done
that
check that there's no mck done at the
bottom of the drain yes there is
all
right and mck will
gather that's just about
it uh
then get your garden
hose take the end of your garden
hose I'm going to get my nailer my handy
nailer
to save
my knees get your garden hose connect it
all up take the the end bit off the
garden hose obviously and bung
it as far
down into the block drain as
possible I I unblocked this drain couple
of days ago so I'm just showing you what
you what you should do then
get any
leftover sheets now normally I use these
sheets for um covering flooring whenever
I'm painting so get any excess or any
old sheets and pack them as
tightly as tightly tightly tightly as
you possibly can down into the hole
now I'm not going to strain myself
because this drain has already been
unblocked but you get get the channel
idea and what you do then to to make
them even tigher down is push them down
with the end of a broom Shaft or
something like that you know
and even further get another one and do
the same and pack it as tightly as you
can down in once you've done that
then turn on your water now I
normally stand with my
foot right
over the uh the the the pack down
sheet and stand there with the water on
for about 5
minutes probably in the 30 first 30
seconds the um the pressure the water's
not going to be able to get up the way
so it obviously has to uh push against
the blockage uh I don't know what it
might be old leaves muck Dey hardened
stuff uh you'd be amazed what you know
goes into these drains and it hardens So
eventually the pressure of the water
will
explode the uh barrier
and you will have uh your drain
unblocked uh just a very very simple um
we piece of advice on how to unblock
drains and one or two other we additives
this here is a god sand uh for
kneeing you can get them about two or
three quid in a garden center or a DIY
Center uh brilliant and there you can
hang it up up as well um and I was just
down this morning to uh the uh a a tar
uh that constantly leaks it's a slow
puncture of some description or maybe
it's the rims and buy yourself one of
these out of uh Halford's or or some
other uh car
maintenance uh
shop um and uh pump your make sure that
you can pump your tires up I've got this
I took this off this morning and it's uh
uh it's not just round the right way
there it is
now and it shows you can put the red
marker to 30 and your black marker is
the amount of pressure going in and it's
uh fit pump and it's excellent and the B
them for about
20 so just uh one or two little handy HS
