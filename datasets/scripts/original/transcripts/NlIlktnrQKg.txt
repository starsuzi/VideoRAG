hey guys um
this is my first time opening um
model magic by crayola
and um i've watched videos and they say
that when it dries it becomes squishy so
i wanted to try this out
so yeah so i'm gonna open it right now
i don't know how to open it though
i think i'm gonna use my handy-dandy
scissors
and cut the top off
so i just cut the top up
so
it's really soft
and really white
and it feels
um has like a foamy texture to it
oh it feels so good
um so yeah i'm gonna be making things
with this um like right now
this is so soft
and um i'll make another video on how it
turns out
um right after i make stuff
so yeah
bye guys
