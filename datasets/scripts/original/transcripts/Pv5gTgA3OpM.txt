I'll put a 1-in scratch in this uh
fender with a
screwdriver it's a deep enough scratch
that uh we're not going to be able to
just apply touchup
paint it's uh it's going to reflect and
show the scratch
still so we'll take our uh our red
filler
putty and a
squeegee we'll wait two minutes for that
to
dry and we'll take
our foam block and we'll wrap
a shop towel around it
and we'll wet the uh the shop towel with
paint
leveler and you'll watch me uh go back
and forth over the repair area many
times 20 plus times and with each pass
I'm taking off a little bit of that red
putty I'm not putting a lot of pressure
on there I'm just uh allowing the
chemical to do to do the work and not my
pressure pressure not the pressure from
my
hand using the edge of the block there
to sort of uh clean around the
scratch and just have a small amount of
putty sitting on top of the scratch so
I'll just take the uh the paper towel
off it's still a little bit damp and
I'll knock uh knock off that top bit of
putty there
and we'll choose a a matching uh chip in
this case uh it looks like uh the bottom
chip which is going to be uh 12 drops of
blue four and eight drops of blue five
is is going to be the match so we'll
shake up our bottles and uh we'll
carefully count our drops into the cup
[Music]
and we'll add two or three drops of
shine so that the paint dries with a
gloss uh this is an optional step on
whites and Silvers and Golds so you may
not notice the difference so you may not
need to use the shine and we'll stir up
our
mixture and so as our final step we'll
take our uh our color matched
paint and just touch up over the the red
putty
so look at how little paint I'm I'm
using here I'm just I'm just getting the
tip of the uh the touch-up
brush barely
wet and instead of trying to go back and
forth across the the scratch with with
Strokes
I'm actually just kind of pecking at it
a little bit at a time to uh to go from
left to right and just connect these
little dots that I'm really slowly
applying to the
scratch and you'll notice that
I'm using the uh the knuckle on my on my
pinky there for
leverage and I'm I'm holding the uh I'm
holding the touch-up brush um just about
exactly as I would a a writing pen or
[Music]
pencil so as the as the paint dries it
it sort of flattens out and um with that
uh foundation of the red
uh filler putty uh we're getting a a
very good result here
