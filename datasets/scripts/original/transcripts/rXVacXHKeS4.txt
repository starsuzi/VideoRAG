okay so some people have been wondering
how best to clean sophie the Giraffe
tailor the manufacturer doesn't
recommend sterilizing Sophie so what we
recommend is just some warm soapy water
on a cloth and just giving Sophie a good
watch now it's best not to submerge
Sophie in water because you will get
water in her squeaker which will be very
hard to remove I believe there is a
Sophie bath toy if you wanted a Sophie
to have your child play with in the bath
but this one yes best not to submerge
you could also wipe it over with an
alcohol wipe if you were concerned about
providing a bit more of a sterile
environment for your child's teething
toy so that's how the things Sophie if
you want any more information about
