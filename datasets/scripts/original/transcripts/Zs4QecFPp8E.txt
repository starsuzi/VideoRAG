so I want to show you this pretty cool
product I found um got it on Home Depot
probably get it at Amazon I'll put a
link in the description down below this
is a landscape edging it's 20t no dig no
dig that's what I was looking for this
is the first edging we bought you have
to dig a trench and bury that down into
the ground and then cover it back up
with dirt on both sides see I have some
Mulch and then I have this sidewalk so
whenever it rains or wind gets real
windy this is rubber mulch by the way so
if if you've uh never worked with rubber
mulch it's awesome highly recommend it
never loses its color never have to
replace it
so um but I had a problem with as you
can see down there you can see the mulch
um like right there coming off onto the
sidewalk so
instead of using the other edging where
I'd have to dig down you know four to 6
in then bury it and then back fill it I
already have all this mulch in there so
that would be a really big pain to do so
I will show you how I am doing this and
what it looks like when I'm done when I
put the Landscaping down I put some of
this weed stop underneath it
so uh that just helps prevent weeds from
growing into your Landscaping so that
kind of helps with what I'm trying to do
here so I kind of peel that back as you
can see there's dirt underneath it
and scrape the rubber mulch
over on top of the
pile and then it just peel this back and
yeah I've got to pick out some but it's
not nearly as bad so then I am staking
it back with a little plastic Stakes
see it there so then I'll get my 20 ft
and then I will put down the
edging okay so I have my 20 ft pulled
back cleared out of the way
and this is the
edging so it's got that edge and then
it's got holes for the spikes that hold
it in so all I do is lay it
down up against the edge of the
sidewalk and then it comes with six
Stakes to hold them
in which are these long stakes and of
course there are more that sold
separately if you need more than the six
that's provided but all you do
every couple
feet if you need more Stakes then like I
said they sell more what you do is get
it where you want it every couple feet
drive a steak into the ground it will
hold it into place place so then when I
have it in
place fold this back over as far as it
will go and then we'll move our rubber
mulch back
in and it will cover up our
steaks and give it a nice Edge
finish
so pretty cool product easy to to
install
and for the this purpose is much easier
than any other edging I have found on
the market all right so they do have
this at
Amazon and it is cheaper so you can buy
40t continuous roll for $23 to $25 on
Amazon that's with free shipping with
prime so if you got a long area to do
40t continuous is nice cuz you won't
have as many seams to as you would if
you bought two individual 20ft things so
there it is see look looks
good
nice nice definition provides
a little bit of
a a lip there to keep it in it's about
an inch and a half down from the bottom
of the lip to the top so that's an inch
and a half so if that is all you need
then this is awesome stuff I will put a
link in the description below to this
stuff on Amazon
so hope uh this helped you hope you
