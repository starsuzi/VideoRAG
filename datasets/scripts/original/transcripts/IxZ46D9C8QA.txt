[Music]
this is what we're going to use to make
this dress today and I'm making an 18mon
size so for an 18mon size your the body
part of your dress would be 18 by 18 but
because I'm going to use a different
color band across the bottom you will
you will make an allowance like I I'm
going to fold this band in half like
this
so you will need to make it that
allowance when you're figuring your 18
by 18 if you're putting a band make sure
you take that into consideration when
you're cutting your bodice and then I
also cut a three and 1/2 by a 4 and 1/2
I cut two squares this is for little I
cut the little I cut the the Minnie
Mouse head and I'll show you how I um
what I do to get my um pattern for
[Music]
this if you buy ribbon you can omit this
step but because I didn't buy ribbon I
cut a 3 and 1/2 by 4 and 1/2 I cut two
squares of that and I cut a 1 and 1/2 by
3 in piece here and this is what is
going to make Minnie Mouse's bow for her
head just because I didn't pick up uh
the ribbon for that and then we're going
to use some Rick rack whatever color you
choose we're going to use ribbon for the
uh for like the straps and then some
scissors of course and then we're going
to use some fusible web to uh secure the
head onto the dress to applique that
okay let's get
started okay the first thing we're going
to want to do is cut a layer of the
Wonder under stitch witchery whatever
you want to call this we're going to
want to cut that out uh of our Minnie
Mouse head that's the first thing we're
going to want to do then we're going to
bring our fabric
over for our the bodice of our
dress and this doesn't have to go in any
particular place I want to put mine over
toward the the um lower edge of the
front so determine where you want that
and we're going to uh pin it on actually
I've got two thicknesses of the dress
here so I don't want that I want want to
pull just the top um just the top
one let's put our Minnie Mouse head just
make sure that you don't get too close
to your side seam or to the the bottom
where your band is going to go so we're
going to put her right here actually I'm
kind of thinking I'm going to put her a
little sideways like
that I'm going to pin her on and then
I'm going to move over to the iron and
iron her
on so that I can U sew around the edges
let me iron her on now that we have
Minnie's head um ironed on to the fabric
I've set my length on my Stitch to
almost zero not quite zero and I've set
my width to between four and five it's
just going to depend on how wide you
want your uh zigzag Stitch around the
outside of it applique um I like mine
kind of wide it's easier to do that way
because you um don't have to be so
careful it'll catch the fabric
easier I like to set mine just a little
bit um on the wide side because it's I
think it looks prettier and it's easier
you don't have to be as careful coming
around you know catching all of it so
we're I'm going to start right here in
the Edge by the
ear put my needle in
[Music]
[Music]
I'm going to pick it up and come around
to the ear so I can make sure it's it's
going to fall exactly where I want I'm
going to scoot it
over just a little bit to make sure
we're catching
[Music]
all right
then we're going to trim our um threads
but there's our Minnie Mouse head all uh
zigzagged on
there okay guys I didn't actually turn
the camera back on but all I've done is
I have
surged down all you know both side seams
uh of the bodice that's all I've done is
I've surged down this the side seams now
I'm going to put it together I'm going
to put it right sides together and um if
you've watched my other uh tutorial that
I have on the pillowcase dresses you'll
know that I come down about 4 in on each
side seam and that's what I'm going to
allow for my armhole uh for these little
dresses so we're going to come down
about 4 inches and we're going to seam
we're going to start right
there we're going to back stitch
it coming down the
side okay we're going to do the other
side the same way and I just usually I
don't have a a tape measure when I'm in
hand when I'm doing this so I'll just
take my other one that I just did to
measure this one by just to know that
I'm doing it the same
amount we're going to do our other
side I'm going to move over to the
ironing board and iron these seams open
so that I can come back and Stitch the
little arm holes okay I have ironed
those open like
this this is what's going to make the
little armhole portion of the dress I'm
going to stitch down this one cross uh
Stitch across here and then go back up
the other side and that's what's going
to form our arm holes
okay we are going to stitch down
then we're going to turn and come across
that
thing and then back up the other
side and that's what it's going to look
like we have stitched it
we went from here down across and then
back up we're going to do the other side
just like
that make sure to leave your needle down
in your fabric so when you go to turn
you have a real pretty
Corner leaving my needle down turn and
come back up the other
side that's both of the arm holes done
now I'm going to Surge out all of the
raw edges this is along the top of the
body I'm going to Serge the top of the
body the bottom of the body and I'm also
going to Surge the band that's going to
go around it let's get started on that
okay this is the top of the bodice we're
going to Surge that out
[Music]
all right that's the top done now I'm
going to Surge out this the bottom edge
of the
[Music]
bodice okay and now on the band I did
not cut it into two pieces I left it in
one long piece so I'm just going to sew
the one seam I'm going to Serge it
closed real
[Applause]
fast all right now that I've got that
surged I'm just going to hold it up to
my
dress just to make sure they are the
same size and they're going to fit you
know right so I'm going to hold fold it
up and make sure it is exactly the width
of my dress okay so we're good now I'm
going to open this this up to the right
sides and I'm going to fold it in half
like this I'm just going to fold it like
that now I'm going to put it under the
serger and surge this out so that it'll
have a finished Edge you can iron it now
if you want to if that makes it easier
for you I don't I just do it all at the
end
[Music]
okay now that I have that done uh I'm
going to lay it aside okay
now I'll be glad when I have my sewing
room set up so I don't have to keep
switching between machines because this
is a pain in the
butt okay now I'm going to take the
bottom of my body to the dress and my
band now since I only left I only had
this one have one seam I'm going to make
sure that seam falls in the center of my
back of the dress so I'm going to pin
these two pieces
together and then I'm going to stitch
them together with the sewing
machine you could ruffle this if you
wanted to I just wanted to leave it as a
straight little band but you could have
easily ruffled it if you wanted to so
now I'm going to sew these two
[Music]
together okay now I've got the band sewn
on I am going to iron it so that this
all Lays in wonder Direction so that
when I sew my uh Rick rack on next it'll
be in the right
place but I'm not going to do the Rick
rack just yet I'm going to come up here
because I don't want to change out my
thread and then change it back again so
while I've still got my red going I'm
going to come up here and I'm going to
turn down about an inch uh right here
across the top and that's going to be my
casing for my
ribbon me do that right quick
[Applause]
[Music]
all right that's one side now I will do
the other I'm going to turn the same
I'll turn one inch down here across the
top for my um ribbon
[Music]
all right and that's the other side let
me trim these crazy
threads okay now also before I take my
red thread off I'm going to come back
here and the the two pieces the
this three and 1/2 by four and A2 it's
two squares I'm going to sew these this
is going to be Minnie Mouse's bow
actually I'm going to do it this way
because I want her bow to be this way so
I'm going to start it across this edge
here and uh SE from here all the way
around back to here and leave me a
opening to turn it right there
[Music]
I left me an opening right here to turn
it I'm going to snip the corners off of
each one of them so that it lays down
pretty when I get it turned just going
to snip those Corners
off now I'm going to take my scissors
I'm going to come into the corner of it
here and pull it
apart take my scissors and poke this up
through
poke it up through the hole that I
left back right side out now I'm going
to take my scissors and poke in it and
straighten all those Corners
out and I'm not going to sew this little
the little hole that I left I'm not
going to sew it closed because uh when
you put your little band on it it'll
it'll close it then you won't have to
worry about
it there I got all my
there I got it sound turned all my
Corners I'm going to snip these threads
and and press it and then I I got it all
pressed out and now this little piece
here I'm going to take and put turn it
right sides together sew across one of
the ends and down so that I'll be able
to turn it this is going to make the
the middle part of her bow I'm just
going to stitch across that
end and then up one
side like that I'm going to take my
scissors and uh poke in here and turn it
right side
out okay and then I just turn that
little strip right side out I'm going to
press that and then I'll have to finish
this out uh with by hand I I would I'll
take
and I'm just going to fold it like a fan
like just fold it backwards and forwards
backwards and forwards like that and
then we will we'll Stitch this on by
hand and that's going to make Minnie
Mouse's hair bow but I'll do that by
hand in just a minute now I'm going to
change my
thread just my top thread I don't have
to change um my bottom thread now I'm
going to turn my dress
right side
out like this this is our little dress
so
far now I'm going to come through and
I'm going to top Stitch my Rick rack
right down the center of those two where
those two
meet actually I'm going to start this in
the back and then I just sew right down
through the middle of my R rack to
attach it to our
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
dress okay and that is what it looks
like with the Rick rack sewn on now I'm
going to take a safety pen and run my
this is the ribbon that I bought I'm
going to take a safety pen and run this
through my top
Edge where I sewed the casing and we'll
be done that's
it I didn't think this out very well I
couldn't find a safety pen so I just
took a piece of wire and stuck through
here and that's how I'm going to get
this this through this top casing I'm
just going to pull the casing back stick
my wire with my ribbon on there and feed
it through this casing it never fails I
could buy
50,000 pens and because I don't have my
sewing room set up and organized there's
no telling where they'll end up so I'm
just going to run that through
here where there's a wheel there's a way
right
[Music]
now let me take my wire off of here and
do the other
[Music]
side and then now we will snip these
ends off off you know to make those
pretty and and you can run a lighter
along the edge of that to seal that
edge or you can use um the uh Fray check
either way the lighter is the easiest in
my
opinion trim all those up and then I'm
going to um Stitch Minnie Mouse's hair
bow together I'm just going to stitch it
real quick with a needle and thread
now I just stitched the
little piece in the middle here I
stitched it closed and now I'm going to
just tack it right here on Minnie's head
[Music]
