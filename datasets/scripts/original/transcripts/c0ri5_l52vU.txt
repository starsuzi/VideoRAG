So, when competing there's basically two types
of yo-yo's I like to use.
For 2A, I like a yo-yo that's light, and fast,
and responsive.
So if you look at this yo-yo, this is what
I would use for a competition, and for 2A.
And it's really light, compared to a metal
one, and it's really fast, so I can do really
quick tricks.
For a style like 1A or 3A, I would use a metal
one, because it requires the yo-yo to sleep
really long and I can't get a long sleeper
with a plastic yo-yo.
For beginners, I recommend a yo-yo that's
fairly inexpensive.
You don't need to spend no more than maybe
$15 to $20 for a good yo-yo to learn on, compared
to a metal yo-yo, you can pay up to $100 to
$300 for a metal one.
It's really hard to learn on.
If you're buying a $300 yo-yo, you can compare
it to buying a Porsche, and trying to take
it out on a track.
If you don't know how to drive it, you're
not going to be able to use it to its full
potential.
The same thing with a yo-yo; you pay $200,
but if you don't know how to use it to its
full benefits, it's a waste of money.
