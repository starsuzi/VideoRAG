hey guys welcome to cooking with
[Music]
jazz So today we're going to be making
something my husband really loves a lot
red velvet pancakes so here's how you do
it we're going to start by mixing some
eggs we're going to whisk this
till it's nice and good make sure to mix
it really well that way you can chop in
air so that the pancakes can be nice and
fluffy next we're going to add the sugar
I always add the sugar
second the essence vanilla
Essence some rice vinegar just to bring
out the sour taste and we're going to
mix that
up after this we're going to add the
flour in bits that way we don't get any
lumps till it's nice and smooth and
doesn't have any lumps so we're going to
add a bit more
milk at this point I'm going to add the
buttermilk
this helps give it a sour taste cuz red
velvet is not supposed to be a very
sweet
recipe so we're just mixing in the
butter followed by the
color and that looks good so we're just
going to start by cooking
this so we're just going to move this to
the
side using a bit of vegetable oil
so that way they don't burn immediately
they heat the pan just add a bit just
about one
spoon maybe we can add a bit
more it's essential to use a non-stick
pan that way the pancakes don't stick to
the bottom so we're just going to let
that cook until it forms bubbles on the
surface so can you see those bubbles
yeah that means that it has cooked well
at the bottom so we're just going to
slip that a it looks
amazing and the first one is ready looks
amazing so we're just going to put it
aside and repeat the process
