so quick so easy and they can be used
for anything so let's
go simple cooking Simple Cooking
Channel now preheat your oven to 350° F
which is about 180° Celsius and you want
to get Parmesan cheese and if you don't
have something that's like this silicone
get some parchment paper baking paper
something like that and
just put it on there we want it to
be in a circle so use a cookie cutter or
you can just arrange it so it's in a
circle if you if you
want just do that with as many of these
little crisps As You Wish now just pop
these in the oven for probably somewhere
between 4 and 6 minutes basically until
the cheese has melted and the edges just
begin to Brown now just leave on here to
cool until it's ready to be taken off
and eaten well I hope you like
these that beautiful so
