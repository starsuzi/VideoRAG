I was an ordinary
boy now I've read somewhere that you can
actually clean your headlights using
bacon sort of
toothpaste so since these are yellow as
anything we're going to have a go see if
it actually works so you want
to quiet
and then just work it
in
too just
[Music]
that I'll find my way just know you're
not alone cuz I'm your home I want to be
with you always now not alone cuz I'm
your home
[Music]
wo I'm going to spray it and then wipe
off see what it looks like compared to
that one
[Music]
[Music]
in the dark we fight you take the Rong
and you make
[Music]
it that's made such a difference I'm
going to give it one more blast one more
go up two layers and then I'm going to
show you the difference cuz that is
amazing we've gone from
this to this
do the same to that side clearly I just
rubbed in a bit of wax to each one of
the headlights show you some Turtle
Wax and I'm going to leave that for a
few minutes and I'm going to wipe it off
and then that should protect it from the
outside and stop it going hazy within
two days
here and that's the final result
sick mate
okay so the toothpaste trick will I rate
it yes I actually did not think that
would work that absolutely I'm out
sounded by the results I actually I've
tried that once for on another car it
didn't work uh but I guess that was just
dirt from the entire the headlight but
on cars like this and where the inside's
actually protected and it's probably
outside of door that's amazing like I
didn't even spend anything on that so
would I try it yes would I recommend it
definitely yes 100% give it a try it's
free you may as
[Music]
well I was
anary
[Music]
Boy until I broke the rules my life
destroyed
