hi I'm Jennifer and today I'm so excited
to share with you another DIY project
making these adorable pajama pants we
even made pajama pants for our ma
matching 18in doll just how cute is that
this is so much fun to do um pajamas for
our little ones and of course we can
make them for ourselves as well but
they're just particularly fun when we're
making them as gifts maybe at Christmas
time or we have kids or maybe a special
sleepover for a birthday where we can
make some pajamas for the kids that'll
be coming to the event so let me show
you just how easy this is um let's get
started the great thing about um making
these pajama pants is you don't have to
be some experienced seamstress I'm a
quilter I don't really do a whole lot of
sewing outside of quilting maybe a
pillow or maybe a valance but this is
something that is very doable so if
you're not very seasoned and uh sewing
garments don't worry you can get this so
what you'll start with first is a pair
of pants pajama pants that already fit
um the person that you'll be sewing the
pajama pants for so if it's you just get
out your favorite pajama pants that are
good and comfortable and you will take
them and simply fold them in half so
you'll have the
side that is curved here the inseam call
it and then the outside so let's put
that aside for the moment and then we'll
bring out our fabric how much fabric
you'll need of course depends on how
size how big you're going to be making
your pajama pants so um since we will be
making these this is for a 3T um this
took about 3/4 of a yard for the pant
itself and then the accent is a quarter
yard now you don't have to do the accent
we love doing that because we love
fabric we love bringing other Fabrics
but you don't have to do that they could
just go full length in one fabric but
let's do two cuz I want to show you how
fun it is to make the little cuff at the
bottom um we chose this adorable fabric
from Frozen because of course Frozen is
really popular right now with all the
kids and so we will be using this for
the main part of the pant and for our
little trm we'll be using a black polka
dot so this will be really fun so you'll
start off with we'll just move the
sewing machine for the out of the way
where we set this
up so you open your Fabric and I do
recommend that you pre-wash this of
course these are pajamas so they're
going to be washed a lot so go ahead and
pre-wash those fabrics and get those
pre-shrunk right up front and don't baby
that fabric get it hot and and wash so
that all the shrinkage is hopefully done
up front before you start making any
kind of garments with it so Let's Fold
this to the inside and how much you fold
to the inside depends on how wide your
pants are so I've got plenty of room
here and we will do the same on the
other
side so I'll fold that in so you're
folding in toward the
center and
now we will fold this way so they're
stacked one right on top of one another
so you see how that happened now we will
take our
pants that we know already fit us and
we're comfortable in them and we will
put that fold right along on this
fold we want to keep
about five 4 to 5 in from the top
because your waistband will go in there
so U depending on the width of your
elastic that will vary um so let's bring
that up ever so
slightly and what we'll do at this
point you can even pin those togethers
if if you wanted to we didn't do that
for any of the sample pajama pants that
we made but if you really wanted that to
not shift at all you could certainly pin
this but again I don't feel a need to do
that now I will take because we'll be
using quarter inch seams excuse me half
inch seams there again I'm a quilter my
brain says quarter inch but for garment
uh sewing we use halfin seams so I will
do a visual half inch up to here and
then as we transition now because the
top is gathered I'm going to actually I
don't want to just have a half an inch
because this is going to be gathered so
if I pull this out you can see I really
need it to be coming to here I'm going
to use my friction pen because the great
thing about the friction pen again I've
told you this in other videos I can mark
in my Fabric and iron it away and it's
gone so it's a great way to have a
temporary Mark I'm going to stretch that
out I'm going to put a little Mark right
there on little Olaf's belly and that's
going to be my visual Target so when I'm
coming around here I'm not going to just
keep a/ an inch away I'm going to widen
just a little bit because I need more
room in the waist so I can gather it
with the
elastic so let's get started we'll just
do our visual half
in if you had a rotary cutter you could
certainly use
that but I'm just going to use scissors
today and I'm looking at this Mark right
now beginning to widen slightly so that
I hit that
Mark and I'll just go straight
up
okay so right now I've got one pant leg
and I've got a second pant leg now
looking at these pants I've got this
much of a cuff here and I've got this
much of a cuff here it's completely up
to you how much cuff that you would like
I I I like a little bit more more cuff
today so I'm going to probably Oh Come
to about here I'm going to fold this up
out of my way so I don't cut my pants so
and then I'll cut a half an inch below
that and that's going to be the main
part of the pant the next thing that we
will cut will be the actual accent or
cuff so let's bring that in and we will
repeat the same
sequence we'll fold the cuff Fabric in
half and we bring that up to our pants
so you've got the two uh rolls and folds
here and the two here now I'm going to
move that up slightly and we need to
make sure that this is the
same width because this will be attached
to that of course so we we don't want to
just ballpark it we need that to be
really accurate so I am going to go
ahead and bring out a
ruler and this is when I am going to go
ahead and use my rotary cutter because
we need it to be so
accurate great we'll take the cff fabric
I will now fold it in half with the
wrong sides together and
press and we'll repeat that for the
other one
now if you have a serger oh my this will
go so fast for you um because then
you're enclosing The Edge and oh my gosh
it's just so quick with a serger I don't
have a serger with me here today so I
will show you how to do this on just a
regular sewing machine so now that these
are pressed we'll go to the pant
leg here open up
one and we will put the raw edges to the
Raw edges like
this and we'll go ahead and
pin that one's ready to go and we'll pin
the other one as
well and then we'll take it to the
sewing machine and we'll sew both cuffs
a half an inch be sure to secure your
stitches now we'll just sew our half in
seam on both Pat legs I'll just do this
one right after it
[Applause]
okay so we're done with the sewing
machine for just a little
while now we'll come back to the um Iron
and we will press these outward and you
can see that I missed it just the the
cuff was just a little bit narrower than
the pant leg um notice the way we laid
the pattern out it's it's very not exact
but you can go and just trim that it's
not a big deal we'll take it to the
ironing board and we'll just
press notice these are raw edges at this
point if you are using a regular sewing
machine you might want to go back at
this time and do an overcast Stitch or a
zigzag to secure the edge again that's
where a surger is so wonderful and you
know surgers are getting more a able
than they were when when they first came
out a long long long time ago so you can
really get a fairly decent surger for
not that much money and boy if you're
going to do a lot of this type of
project it it'd be worth it to you um so
let's get the other leg pressed as
well
okay
now let's look at this are we of course
we want the legs to be symmetrical so if
you're going to make any adjustments you
would want to adjust them both at this
point so I'm just going to check I know
I need to adjust that one leg because
that one came down just a little bit the
trim piece was just a little bit
narrow and that was just because when I
laid it out that
happened but that's okay I know in
quilting I have to make adjustments a
lot my blocks often are just a little
bit under in size and so I do find
myself adjusting so we're just going to
make a little bit of an adjustment
here so I'll go in here and just ever so
slightly bring both of those in to meet
that
trim and that's that's life you know you
have to make adjustments and crafts and
DIY to make it all work okay now that
the legs are
done I will turn each pant leg so that
their wrong sides are
together and I'm going to start down
here I want to make sure of course that
little intersection matches up so I'm
going to look right there I'm going to
put a pin because we want that of course
to come together pin right
there and we will
pin and sew from here all the way to the
inseam where it begins to curve back so
you'll just so all the way literally off
we'll do repeat that for the other
leg let's just go put a couple pins in
we don't want anything to shift on
us okay and let's do the same thing with
the other
leg let me turn it around I'm so
right-handed oh my
[Applause]
goodness okay again let's find that
little
spot pin it
pin there first because I know I need
that to come together for
sure and I know I need that area to come
together and we'll
pin and we'll take it back to the sewing
machine and we'll sew a half an inch
again let's do that step now
I'm going to go back and secure that
real real
well
great okay so let's look at what we have
so
far two
legs sewn
up until the the point of the
transition now so let's just look at
what we have so far so you can see it
coming together how cute is that so now
we we need to join these two sections so
we will just bring them
together just like this and we will pin
all the way
around okay so you want to be just take
your time make sure everything is
married up the way it should be
be coming across the the very center
there that's right in that very center
portion of the inseam I like to bring
those seams open so there's not quite so
much bulk actually you know what they
want to do right now is lie opposite
that works as well you're just trying to
reduce bulk right there in the um
transition
area let's pin that
and then we'll come back out to the
other
side okay now that everything is pinned
we'll take it back to the sewing machine
and of course we'll sew another half in
seam all the way
around great so now our pants are sewn
let's trim some of those
threads and let's look at what we have
so
far oh these are so cute so so
cute so all that's left to do at this
point is to put the elastic waistband in
Secure that and then maybe put a cute
little bow of course that's optional but
it definitely increases the cuteness
Factor now we had a wide um elastic here
because we were making some skirts um
the size of the elastic it doesn't
really matter so I'll just pick I'll
just grab this wider um elastic that we
have as far as the length of course for
for the person that you may be making
the pants for um you're just going to
put that around their waist um and if
you don't know you can guesstimate it
just like pajamas I mean they're it's
not like it's a fitted garment if it's
in the ballpark it's going to be fine so
um
we wanted a waistband about like this
this is for um a 3T so probably about
like that add about I don't know 3/4 of
an inch to an inch past that because
it's going to crisscross and secure so
that's the length that we're going for
here is
about you don't want it too too tight so
probably about like that and I'll add
just a little bit more
all right so this is when you can
determine how much that this determines
the width of your elastic how much extra
fabric that you had at the top of the
pants because we had a wider elastic we
had to have more fabric so that's going
to come just like that now I do like to
roll that edge under at this
point so that's not not going to fray it
all so I will go with my iron and I'm
going to press that under about a half
an inch all the way around so let's go
do that step right
now so I'll just fold it down and press
all the way around half an
inch and when I uh get that done we'll
come back and put the elastic
in okay so that's that's
now iron down I'm going to put the
elastic waistband where I feel it would
be of course this fabric has to not only
cover that but go a little bit beyond
that so that we can sew it down so let's
just
look that looks like a really good spot
you don't want too much of a gap in
there or the elastic waistband can twist
which drives you crazy I'm sure you've
had clothes that do that and makes makes
you just a little bonkers so uh probably
about like that with this particular
elastic sck and I'm just going to take
that out I'm going to pin that and I'm
just going to I can even measure that if
I want to looks like that's about 2 in
and I can just continue turning and
pinning so I have that 2 in all the way
around so we'll do that and once that's
complete then we'll go sew that
down now that I have everything pinned I
will take this to the sewing machine
I will sew all the way around this I
don't need to sew a a half an inch at
this point I'll sew probably just a
little bit under that and I'm not going
to completely go all the way around I'll
leave about a 2 or 3 in gap that's where
we'll feed in the elastic for the
waistband now if you have a really
you're sewing a small pair of these for
a little child you may want to take this
part of your machine off
um and that way it's just a little bit
easier for that pant leg to get in there
so
that's that's another option for you
that's why that has the ability to come
off so I'm just finishing this up and
notice I've got about a 2 to 3 in gap
we're going to stop right there and this
is where we will uh feed in our elastic
which we will show you now how to do
that so we've got the piece that we
wanted we will take
a safety pin and put
that at the end there and begin to fish
this through this opening you want to
just make sure that there's no twisting
when you start feeding that through so I
will feed that through and we'll come
out to the other end and then I'll show
you how to secure that and finish your
pants so now that you fish through the
elastic you've got two ends so what
we'll do at this point we can even just
pull those out so you can see it better
we'll crisscross those like
that take it to the sewing
machine and that can be kind of tough in
fact I'll just pull it out more so I can
get get it a little awkward bringing it
to the sewing machine cuz it's like how
do you maneuver this whole thing uh
let's see how do we do it like
that get enough of a crisscross for this
I'm going to use a zigzag Stitch that
seems like it's going to have more
strength and I'm going to even shorten
the length cuz I don't want that to come
apart let's get that really good
[Applause]
okay CU of course there's a lot of
strain on the elastic as you put the
pants on and take them off that would be
a vulnerable area I'm going to go back
to a straight
Stitch so when we come
back we're ready to go so now that
that's secured let's just pull on that
waistband and that'll naturally go
inside we will now go back to the sewing
machine and just close close the area
that had been
open all right this is so fun turning
them right side out it's like it's like
Christmas I'm excited to see what they
look
like let's just trim off all those
little
threads and then we will turn them right
side
out and look at what we've
created someone's going to be very
excited to get these little old off
pants so so
cute just look how
adorable these pants are now
just look how cute these are and we can
add a little ribbon embellishment if you
do want to add that you'll just get a
little bit of coordinating trim we just
chose a cute little
white you can make that as long or short
as you want and you'll just go in the
middle of your
pant and we'll do a straight Stitch
where we're just coming in not all the
way so we don't want to go all the way
from top to bottom or when we tie our
knot it's going it just it won't close
in properly so we'll do about half of
it make sure you got the center of
it yes that's about the center and there
we have our
Center so just
come and you're going to want to Zig it
go forward and back several
times again another area that'll be kind
of a vulnerable area
we'll trim our
threads tie a cute little bow
here and these will be ready for gift
giving now how cute would this be to
give these pants and if you if you've
seen our uh Magic pillowcase tutorial
you could give these pants and then use
the same Fabrics in a coordinating
pillow so the gift you're giving is the
pillowcase and the pajamas just another
great gift giving idea so this is how
our pants look how adorable is that so
thank you so much for letting me share
with you this fun DIY project of how to
make custom pajamas
