hello it's jennifer from sea lemon last
week i was house sitting and i brought
kona along with me and i decided to try
my hand at some homemade pumpkin dog
traits if you want to make these for
your pup you can follow along to the
same recipe i used or you can substitute
and adjust it to fit your dog's diet
with kona i found that foods that don't
include grain are usually easier for her
to digest they just make her skin and
coat look better and i just like to feed
her the most natural things as possible
so with that in mind these pumpkin
treats are grain free no artificial
coloring and actually have a lot of
fiber in them so if anything these will
help your dog's digestion you can find a
list of the ingredients and substitutes
in the video description below and let's
get to it
in a bowl i added 1 cup of coconut flour
1 egg
a half cup of pure pumpkin
and for extra orange color four ounces
of pure carrot baby food
mix all of those ingredients together
and you'll notice the batter is a little
airy and crumbly that is totally normal
for coconut flour and it will hold a
shape once it's pressed together this
next part is optional if you want to add
a green stem add a fourth cup into a
separate bowl and mix about three
tablespoons of pure green bean baby food
to make a green batter
now back to the orange batter press some
together in your hand to form a flat
circle shape that's like a pumpkin and
these are about two inches in size
if the dough gets a little dry you can
add a little water to it so that it
continues to hold its shape
place the pumpkins onto a 13 by 19
baking sheet and this will get you about
24 pumpkin treats with the green batter
form a small stem on top of each pumpkin
and you can add more detail with a fork
to make some grooves
and blend the green part if you need to
so that it stays onto the treat
now these pumpkins are ready to bake at
350 degrees fahrenheit in the oven
for 35 to 40 minutes and keep an eye out
on the edges of the treats until they
are a brown color
after they've cooled down then they're
ready to serve to your pup these will
keep up to a few weeks and you can also
freeze them i found the grooves made it
easy to break the cookie in pieces the
texture is kind of like a baked soft
cookie so i think it works better to
serve it into little bites kona seems to
really like these so i think that means
they are a success be sure to follow me
