hi guys I am Patty elhoff the author of
upcycle with decapage available on
Amazon Barnes & Noble and Obby books and
today I'd like to show you how we're
going to make this very pretty
decorative plate and here are the
supplies you'll need you want to find
some nice wrapping paper these are
decopage scissors you want a glass plate
so you'll want a stand you'll want some
paper
towels decopage
glue going to need a credit card or an
old card of some type some Sponge
brushes a nail
file dish of water a shallow plate of
water we're using I'm using polyacrylic
anything you want can be used to seal
this something called glimmer
Mist I'm using some Martha Stewart
coarse
glitter and we're going to be using a a
paint marker
but the first thing we'll want to
do is to make some of these lovely
background papers I'm taking a paper
towel the shallow bowl of water which is
a little cloudy now and what I'm going
to do is dip my sponge brush in the
decapage
glue and I'm going to blot it down this
is a pretty sturdy paper towel some of
them might come apart when you do this
so you want to make sure you're using
one of the stronger
ones then I took the glimmer
mist and sprayed it in different areas
I'm putting it in the warming drawer on
high to let it dry perhaps while these
are drying it's a good time to cut out
your images from your wrapping paper and
this is what reverse decapage means I'm
trying to get that glare off of there
for you all of your work is going to be
done on the back facing forward first do
a dry run see where you would like your
images to go on your plate
and what I'm going to do now is flip my
plate
over and in order to make this paper a
lot more pliable I'm going to dip it in
my shallow dish of water soaking wets
I'm going to put it on the craft paper
for a second just to let that
absorb some of the
water and I'm going to take my decapage
glue and apply it right where I'm going
to put
this section of
paper this has a straight edge so what
I'm going to do is overlap The Edge turn
it
over here's what you see right now but
but what we want to do is get some of
this excess glue out there's also some
air bubbles that I can feel which is
why we're going to use the credit card
just make sure you get these edges
the plate looks very messy right now
which is fine I'm going to try to turn
this over carefully so I don't touch my
work here's how the front of it looking
right now little bit sloppy and and I'm
going to put this aside to dry but first
those edges that we had overlapping I'm
going to take the nail
file while the paper is still pretty wet
and pliable and I'm just going to go
around these edges and file them
off so I'm just going to put this in a
very very dry room and let it dry off it
normally takes about 20 to 30 minutes
plate is dry
and now we're going to
take these pieces of paper towel that
we've glimmer misted glittered and torn
up and all I'm going to do is flip the
plate over I'm going to apply decoupage
glue and make sure you're laying the
paper the correct side down and because
this paper has lines in it I am going to
keep those all going in One Direction so
instead of going like this this this
this and this I'm going to keep it all
in one direction and I want to make sure
I'm getting the glimmer Mist SLG glitter
side
down got a clean fresh brush
here and I'm going to cover those blank
areas
first and keep the paper moving in the
same
direction now I'm wetting the brush a
tiny bit just the tip of
it and I'm going to Pat this down
because it's textured paper it's a
little bit thicker
so I'll go all around and
add the paper
as you're going over the areas where
you're going to apply the paper
towel you're also applying another coat
of decapage glue over the work that
you've just done which will help to seal
it and protect
it make sure that your paper doesn't
stick to the surface underneath your
plate because when you go to pull it up
it may tear and rip off the section that
you just worked
on you might want to save this for a
different
project and just apply strips of the
plain old paper towel on here and use a
little glimmer
Mist you notice I'm patting it instead
of going like this I don't want to pull
up any of the work we just did so I'm
going a little too heavy-handed here as
a matter of of fact let me lighten that
up a little
bit now I'm going to add the glimmer
Mist over the whole back of the plate
just because I want to keep this
consistent in case someone picks the
plate up and looks at the back and goes
wow what is this how did you do this I
don't want them to see this big white
patch
you can see it's laying a nice and
consistent pattern which I like and I'm
going to put this 15 minutes in the
warming drawer and then I'll come right
back make sure all of your ends are
down by the way I
placed a ceramic oven safe Bowl
underneath the dish and the dish is face
down so that all of your wet paper is
safe all of the decapage is safe and
this way if anything were to drip off it
won't pull under your plate it'll just
drip
down and even still you don't want these
loose
edges to either get stuck on the glass
when you lay this flat down or get stuck
on possibly the aluminum foil and bake
onto that and then tear away from your
work this was taking so long to dry that
I put it in the convection oven at 175
and left it in there for about 20
minutes it was just so thick and wet I
knew I'd be safe at that temperature and
it is now dry and what I want to do is
go around the edges now and remove all
of these
loose now that those edges are all
sanded off I'm going to to take the poly
crylic that I've stirred
up and I'm going to use a chip brush as
opposed to a sponge brush for
this I'm really going to saturate this
paper and this will not go in the oven
this is going to hand dry hand dry this
is going to air dry
and that shouldn't take too long
actually I'll put it outside it's a
sunny breezy day so I'm going to put it
in the direct sun
light uh probably inside a box so that
nothing blows onto
it and I'll be right
back I'm going to take a bunched up
paper towel and go underneath the plate
because I can see that this is dripping
I put it on really heavy and I just want
to make sure none of it gets onto the
front of the
plate here is the front of our
plate I'm sorry that light shining a
little bit too much on
it and in order to finish up the edges a
little a little bit I took a few paint
markers and just made a couple of marks
with each one to see which one would
best match it I would say this color
best matches the plate and I'm just
going to go around the whole end of it
the whole Edge this is a little hard to
do on camera or through the
camera and I'm just going
to keep getting the tip
saturated and go around the whole Edge
with the paint
marker so here is the final image of our
plate on its
stand so feel free to ask me any
questions I'm all too happy to answer hi

made out there in YouTube land I'll see
