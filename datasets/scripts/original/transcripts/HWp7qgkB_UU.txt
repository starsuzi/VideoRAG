I'm going to show you how to make a
chewy Anzac biscuit recipe the best
thing about the Anzac biscuit is that it
doesn't use any
egg so let's start with the ingredients
you'll need one cup of plain flour
shifted half a cup of desiccated
coconut 1 cup of rolled
oats 125 G of butter half a cup of
castor sugar half teaspoon of bicup
soda and finally 2 tbsp of golden
[Music]
syrup now grab your mixing bowl and pour
in the sugar shift the flour coconut and
rolled
oats afterwards grab your spoon and mix
all the dry ingredients together once
done you can put the bowl to the
side for the next step we'll need to
melt the butter and the syrup
together in this video I'll be using the
microwave but you can also use the stove
top and cook the butter and the syrup in
a pot as
well once the butter and the syrup has
melted put it to the side mix to by car
soda with boiling water roughly it's
about 2 tpoon of hot
water afterwards you can add in the
bicup soda into the melted butter and
syrup mix
now you can add the wet mix into the dry
mix afterwards grab your spoon and start
mixing all the ingredients together you
can preheat the oven to 140 cus
fanforce or
284
F grab your baking tray and put baking
paper on top you can either use a
tablespoon scoop the mixture and put it
on tray afterwards use the spoon to
flatten out the mixture
or you can grabb a small handful of the
mix roll it up into a bowl once you
place it on tray squish it
down I found it much easier doing it by
hand but once again it's up to
you once your tray is all filled up you
can now put it into the oven once again
you can set the oven to 140 C or either
284 f I use fan force in my oven if you
have an older oven obviously you'll need
to set it to a different degree as well
maybe a bit more hotter it should take
about 15 to 20 minutes to cook if you
prefer the cookie to be a little bit
more harder and more Brown then leave it
in there for a little bit longer I'll
say 25 minutes roughly but make sure you
just keep an eye out for it I hope you
