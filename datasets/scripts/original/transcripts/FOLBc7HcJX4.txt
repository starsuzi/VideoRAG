hey guys today I'm going to show you you
how I do my faux mercury glass uh you're
going to need any kind of glass um these
are hurricane lamps and I picked them up
at Goodwill for three bucks three bucks
a piece so uh the other thing you're
going to need is the kryon looking glass
paint you can pick it up at Hobby Lobby
and that's the only place I've actually
ever seen it so let's get
started you're also going to need a
spray bottle with some vinegar and to
shake shake shake shake shake this kryon
paint you need to shake it for about 2
minutes in order for it to be ready all
right the next thing you're going to
do is you're going to take your glass
you're going to
lightly Mist
it with the
vinegar you're going to take your
looking glass paint
and start
spraying sorry I know this is shaky I'm
doing it outside with a handheld
[Music]
camera you want to do a few layers
and then
quickly misted again with your
vinegar just
keep spraying and
spraying the last thing I like to do is
spray so that you get some pretty big
little petals and then do one more light
mist this helps to give it that grungy
old old vintage
look then the last thing you're going to
do give it one more good
spray with the
vinegar and then just
lightly
Pat lightly
Pat with paper
towels then if you have too many clear
spots you can go back and start the
process all
over here's your final
product I went ahead and did the inside
and the outside just so I could get a
little bit more
coverage for
