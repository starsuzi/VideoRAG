How to Sew a Button by Hand.
Not wearing your favorite shirt because it’s
missing a button?
Don’t worry—sewing on a new one is simple
and fast.
You will need A button A needle Thread Scissors
and a straight pin or toothpick.
Step 1.
Select an appropriate button and matching
thread for the article of clothing.
Check to see if the manufacturer included
extra buttons.
Step 2.
Cut a suitable length of thread with scissors
(12 to18 inches is generally enough), and
thread and knot your needle.
Step 3.
Position the button and check to make sure
it lines up with the buttonhole.
If you are replacing a button, look for tiny
holes in the fabric left by the previous button,
and put your new button there.
Step 4. Make your first stitch by inserting
the needle into the back of the fabric (where
the knotted end won't show) and through one
of the holes in the button.
Be sure to pull the thread completely through
on each stitch to keep it from bunching up.
Step 5.
Take a pin or a toothpick, and center it on
top of the button.
This will create space between the button
and the fabric, so that later the button will
slip easily into the buttonhole.
For now, hold the pin in place with your finger.
Step 6.
Insert the needle through the next hole, into
the fabric, and all the way through.
This stitch will now hold the pin in place.
Step 7.
Insert the needle back up through the fabric
and into the first hole.
If you have a four-hole button, stitch up
through a new hole.
Pull the thread all the way through.
Step 8.
Keep repeating these stitches until the button
is secure.
This will usually take eight complete stitches.
Step 9.
On your last stitch, end with a double knot
on the back side of the fabric.
Step 10.
Now cut the excess thread and remove the pin.
Gently pull up on the button to create space
for the fabric.
Step 11.
Button up your refurbished article of clothing
with pride.

3,000 years ago, although they were originally
worn as decoration.
