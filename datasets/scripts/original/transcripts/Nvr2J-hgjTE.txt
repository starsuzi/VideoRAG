caesar but the
best caesar you have ever had in your

alcohol just vodka for this puppy
one ounce
okay and the uh the regular traditional
stuff okay uh
is the you know salt and pepper lee and
parents the tabasco sauce but we're
going to add a little bit extra flavor
today okay so
to do that we're going to have to muddle
some
basil okay so we're going to add some
basil leaves in here
and for a little bit of spice some
jalapeno
so i just did a couple slices of
jalapeno okay and i'll put it in there
and i'm going to muddle the hell out of
these things
okay we're just releasing the oils and
the juices
okay
i like to get the stuff off the muddler
so i'm going to pour a little bit in
here
and swirl it around a bit
okay now the regular uh liam terrans

or louisiana

have
the jalapeno pepper in there right so
