A chalk ball is a really useful tool for climbers
to have, because it contains all of that chalk
that's necessary to grip the wall.
And in fact, a lot of indoor climbing facilities
require the use of a chalk ball, over the
loose chalk, to prevent the mess.
Today we're going to show you how to make
your own chalk ball.
All that you need for this project is a pair
of nylons, a cup, a scissors, and some loose
climbing chalk.
So the first thing that you're going to need
to do, is take that nylon and insert it into
your cup to create a nice little funnel when
you pour your chalk inside.
Then next, you just need to take that chalk,
pour it right in until you feel like you have
enough to make a good chalk ball, and then
grab that nylon out of the cup, tie it off
in a knot and use your scissors to cut the
excess nylon off.
And you can actually make multiple chalk balls
out of one pair of nylons.
All you need to do is tie off the end of the
nylon and then do the same process that I
just described.
And the best part about these is that when
you start running low on chalk all you need
to do is untie it, refill it, and you're good
to go to keep on climbing.
