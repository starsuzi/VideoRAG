have you ever tried Greek feta cheese
five it's absolutely delicious and
here's how you can make it using your
own homemade Philippi strip in a large
mixing bowl
some salt the egg yolk and the vinegar
mix and combine the ingredients and
knead as much as you can stand the dough
should end up soft as a baby's cheeks as
my mom cover the dough and let it rest
for now
dust your working surface and divide the
dough into equal parts sprinkles are
first the pieces flour
and roll it out into the future the
shape is currently not important so if
you're feel kind of resembles the shape
of the African continent
do not worry just try to make it as thin
and large as possible when your fuel
pastry is of a decent size spread butter
all over the surface
if you don't wish to get butter all over
your sleeves like my mother feel free to
use a silicon brush
sprinkle a filo pastry with sunflower
and only until it looks like a law
again spread some butter
drinking this
and first nail we beat the whole process
for the second part of the dough let the
snails rest for an hour or a night
depending on your hurry and again roll
out each one of them into a sheet
this time shape and size are important
in order to fit your baking tray
when the two phyllo sheets are ready but
some breast and the meantime prefer the
two
whisp yet
crumble the feta cheese add some pepper
and mix the eggs with a cheese
use Thank You marbling to grease your
bacon
it is obvious that my mother declared
war to silicone brushes place one of the
feel of pastries at the bottom of the
baking tray and don't worry about the
wrinkles consuming will only make your
pie crust here spread the filling evenly
all over the field sheet
cover the filling with a second solution
and again not worry about the wrinkles
use a sharp knives cut the pie and
square or diamond shape pieces
finally sprinkle some olive oil place
the tray at the lower track of your oven
and bake at 180 socio degrees thirty
minutes only by the bottom element and
30 more minutes goes by bottom and top
elements your feta cheese pie is ready
