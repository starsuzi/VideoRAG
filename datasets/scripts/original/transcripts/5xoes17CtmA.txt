traffic's already starting okay i gotta
run out really fast but before i leave i
do just want to say
if you guys missed my main channel video
i did a video
titled fat versus skinny and i basically
just addressed
the double standards that i've been
facing over the past you know you're
actually basically the whole time that
i've been on youtube and i filmed a
video all about
it and the response has been absolutely
incredible so to any of you guys who
have ever defended me or watched the
video or just
have been responding to the video thank
you so much because
i wasn't expecting this at all honestly
i was really really scared to put the
video up and i'm just so happy that so
many people are resonating with it it's
just
it means the world so thank you guys if
you haven't checked it out it's over on
my main channel so go do that
but today i have just been working on
that i've been like responding to
comments doing social stuff emails and
working and cleaning up my apartment i
cleaned
out my closet this morning or not

couple days a lot of people thought that
mr kate was coming to my office to
redecorate i apologize to let anybody
down who really wanted her to come i

let me set you guys down in here that
good has a lighting it's a little dark
it's fine my dirty towels

much better so after last talk to you

spray my hair a little bit it is raining
so hard outside i'm pretty sure
my hair is going to fall out tonight not
fall out of my head like
curls are going to fall out after let's
talk to you guys i came back here and
sarah was here and we got
so much work done there is so much stuff
happening right now you guys i got a
little overwhelmed
but we're good got everything sorted i
literally have just been working that's
literally it it is now later i
self tan myself so i'm looking at tanner
now i just did my hair
and my makeup i'm wearing green contacts
and i'm eating
hairspray i've been liking playing with
the colored contacts i think they're so
much fun so i'm going to
the mary poppins premiere tonight i'm
going to go walk the carpet
for that oh by the way i'm wearing this
lip color this is the
fenty stunna lip paint and unveil i
actually have no idea what i'm wearing
so i might have to switch the lip if it
doesn't look good but i liked like the
brown lip with the green i thought it'd
be pretty i have an idea of a dress that
i might wear i don't know if i'm gonna
go like fancy or if i want to go more
like
clubby i'm not really sure and the thing
is like with the carpet you can wear
like
whatever so yeah we're gonna decide what
to wear and then
uh we need to head out after the
premiere i think i'm gonna come home and
get some more work done just because
so much stuff is happening prepping for
vlogmas i've got the interior decorator
coming
tomorrow so i had to clean up that
closet room and then tonight there is
another event
lancome and vogue are throwing a party
together and that's gonna be really fun
so we're playing it by ear first of all
we're just gonna take it step by step we
need to pick an outfit
to wear tonight so uh let's go do that
first up in the closet room i don't
really have a light right now i have
this little lamp back here but
tomorrow after the whole redo we'll have
a light in here
i need to decide on a dress to wear so
we'll go in the dress closet wow it's so
dark
all right well you can't see anything
i'm gonna pick a dress from here try it
on
figure it out i could wear like this
dress here this is like a black dress
with some little like
crystally beads on top or like the strap
i don't know
i don't know okay hold on i'll come back
all right guys we've decided
on an outfit is this my worst idea yet
considering that it is pouring rain and
i'm wearing a long skirt
yeah maybe you can't really see because
my full-length mirror outside is covered
by
boxes for the big room thing tomorrow
but i'm wearing this green maxi velvet
skirt that i got from passive cb with
this little white
top from cb i'm gonna wear some white
heels we're gonna head out on the road
head to hollywood it's gonna be a long
drive because there is a lot of traffic
i look extremely short right now
whoops okay let's switch to the phone
let's go movie premiere yay

premiere this is nick

and lin-manuel miranda came out on the
carpet while i was having all the
the what are they the pop rocks you're
like

all that out there's some beautiful
little
trees little cherry blossom action but
it's really pretty
and yeah that's my update okay bye hi
guys i've never filmed from this angle
before
you can see my really messy table hold
on let me clean it for you
hold on my version of cleaning for
vlogging is just moving things to the
ground so you can't see them
all right much better so i'm home now
and
uh i came back had a great time
at the premiere got back here the
weather has been crazy and traffic was
insane because
no one can drive in the rain including
me came home got dressed was gonna wear
this dress out to the next event and
then i decided you know what
i'm staring in as much as i would love
to go meet up with my friends hang out
have a little drink dance a little bit i
would much rather be in sweatpants and
editing my vlog
and wearing honey pop tonight so that's
what we're gonna do
i'm also just standing in my kitchen
eating popcorn i need to do my grocery
haul for you guys hold on let me grab
the stuff
jesus watching me like i'm crazy i'm not
even eating dinner this is just my
dinner right now i'll eat dinner
eventually i always think popcorn is
like a sufficient meal but i eat the
entire bag and i'm still hungry and i
also just am so hungry when i eat it
that i like
shove mouthfuls like handfuls in my
mouth
it does nothing i don't know what oh man
already these guys are like molding
and this one what the heck trader joe's
i want to refund
i actually saw that if you take
something back to trader joe's if it's
not to your
pleasure then they'll give you a full
refund which i think it's okay i think
that was it
tasty moldy you know how people comment
like oh remy i would watch you eat a
bowl of cereal in your kitchen for 20
minutes which is what content you wanted
i'm eating moldy blackberries trade
shows i got some moldy blackberries i
also got
it's cold in here i'm putting the heater
on next up trader joe's
i got we got baby spinach because i go
through a bag of spinach in
a day ooh i got my little butternut
squash zigzags i love to put these in
my air fryer they are so good still
figuring out the timing on them though
because sometimes i burn them like
really badly we got snow peas which are
really good in a stir fry
we got butternut squash little cubes i
got these little persian cucumbers i
actually wanted the big ones but i
couldn't find them
and then we also got this riced
vegetable medley this is a blend of
cauliflower broccoli carrots green onion
and yellow onion

few oranges because
i've been loving having oranges as a
snack ooh
i got a bunch of these little perfect
bars they're so yummy and then i
also got these sweet potatoes i just hit
my head it's fine
and then air one i got a little sushi
roll that i ate earlier
vegan raw kelp noodles these ones are
the one with pesto and then i also got
this one with the black pepper sauce

i really like these i'm probably gonna
finish this for dinner

already eaten like half
a bag so we're good i got the cinnamon
popcakes which i've already eaten like
four or five of these
they're super super good i got the whole
wheat and the cinnamon as you can tell
i've really
gone in on these they're super good
really easy to snack on they kind of
taste like a packing peanut but they're
really good actually i take it back not
really good but like it's a good snack i
got some
chicken breast tenders which i want to
make almond crusted chicken and then put
it in the airfryer
eventually i'll probably do that
tomorrow i got some ground turkey to
make
tacos and turkey patties and things i
got the mother-in-law's kimchi i think
i've tried this one before actually when
i got home i was like i think i got this

korean grocery store so i'll go grab
that eventually

rolls
