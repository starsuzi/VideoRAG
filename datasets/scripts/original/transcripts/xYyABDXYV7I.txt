to make this project you will need
decoupage paper decoupage glue for glass
which can also be used on plastic
ceramic and metal and finally a glass
object
cut the decoupage paper into strips
I am going to stick the strips of
decoupage paper as an angle creating a
decorative pattern on the bass
to activate the decoupage glue you will
have to put the glue until you see the
glue start to come out be careful not to
over pump the pen
apply the glue to the first section
which your first strip of dark wash
paper will be placed then gently add the
decoupage paper
continue to add the decoupage glue and
the paper completing one section at a
time
you can use a wet wipe to help you stick
the strip's down
carefully cut around the edges of the
glass to remove excess paper
I am now going to stick the other strips
of decoupage paper at a different angle
again carefully cooked to remove the
excess paper
once you have completely covered the
glass with strips you need to add a
final layer of decoupage glue this
varnish is the pattern and once dried
leaves a glass finish
