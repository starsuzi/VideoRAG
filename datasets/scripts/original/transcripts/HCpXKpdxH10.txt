eating a corn on the cob or a
mexic corn or
elote there's many ways you could call
this so not really but you know a lot of
people know it by a different
name and I'm going to put I'm going to
decorate it or garnish It Whatever right

this really quick this is a a rambutan R
rambutan rambutan um drink and it says
it's a suculent and juice juicy and
sweet and it says you can add to salads
drinks and desserts it says peel and
remove seed refrigerate after purchase
so that is what it says here and this is
what it looks like it looks like a hairy
little ball like a porcupine
porcupine and then um this is product of
Guatemala
so yeah this
is this is how it came in and that was
$5 and this is what it looks
like it looks so cute look at
that the consistency kind of looks like
a jellyfish but like like it's a really
like a really hard um jellyfish
so that is what it looks like and where
is my straw here it is and it kind of
gives you like a milk type of color and
it has the taste of a coconut coconut
water I don't know why it's giving me
like the
coconut flavor so
let me know if you've ever heard of this
fruit or have you ever tasted it before
so let's put that here on the side and
let's Mo my
El and I got this from my local street
vendor let's see if you can see it
better now and I'm just going it already
has this has mayo and then some cheese
but I'm just going to add a little bit
of more cheese because I like it and so
it could have a little bit of like my
plate could look beautiful Pur so I'm
just going to throw it like that like if
I was a restaurant like that and then um
like that let's put some all over my
plate just so that it looks
pretty you guys know I like to upgrade
everything so there it
is can you guys see
it this is what it looks like right now
there is that
better
so then I'm going to add some chili
powder I'm just going to use this one
cuz I bought it and I have not used it
so just going to put a little bit of
that I'm just going to put it all over
my plate too just for garnish and so
that it can look
pretty and then m if you guys could see
this it looks so
beautiful like
that okay you guys

Valentina let's give it a little
shake and I'm also going to do some
crazy things like that like that go like

overdid myself

with my street corn so I got this at my
with my local street vendor so and
lastly let's go ahead and add some
lime this is from my lime
train so let's go ahead and do that
let's just do that and
voila so this like a few months ago I
remember last time I went with the my
local street vendor lady the corn was
150 but now it's
175 if you want to do this at your house
you want to um I think I saw these a
week ago at Walmart for 2ent
so just if why or you could just go to
your local Street vender and get some so
go ahead and take the first
bite and then I can go ahead and take my
first
bite
M so delicious
yummy have you guys ever had an elote a
corn like
this I'm going to get
messy but that's
okay H let me many of
you like the lotes like
this
no
rambutan surprisingly has a lot of
health
benefits
so one of the benefits it has
it boosts boosts energy so it says the
carbohydrates and protein content of the
rambutan help to increase the energy and
prevent blowing rambutan is also rich in
water which helps to regain the Lost
energy and quen quenches thirst so
let me put some on the other
side this is so delicious let me put
some of this
Valentina like that
so it
also the other benefit absorption of
micro
nutrients eliminates free
radicals I'm just reading off health
benefits on here it says generation of
white and red blood cells removes waste
from kidneys
it's a good source of iron iron iron
iron
iron high fiber
content treating common
illnesses antiseptic properties
antiseptic properties kills
parasites and then it also it's also
good for the skin
so beautiful I like
it so it hydrates the skin it's also
good for skin for hair care
so there you go I read a few there is
more okay
so here where I live you could get the
uh
corn by a local street vendor sometimes
there's a lady pushing a cart and
screaming
elotes
so and they don't just sell a it could
tell
tamales
chichon you know do you guys have that
in where you
live sometimes they're
even outside of store like a liqu store
or something like that
if you want to make it
yourself buy the
corn boil it in hot water let it boil
until it's
ready put mayonnaise mayonnaise
uman poo that's what it's called in
Spanish this
one if you don't know I'm going to put
it on the description
box and then you can add some Valentina
or some chili powder like this
so when I was smaller I would only take
like a few bites and then tell my mom
I'm
done think you guys eat it like all
clean or do you guys leave like a few
corn
spots they also sell
um corn
