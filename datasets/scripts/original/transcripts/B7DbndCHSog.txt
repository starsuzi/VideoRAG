hello today i'm making a fresh tomato
pizza sauce
it's summertime i got these tomatoes
from a local farmer
and i wanted to show you just what i'm
doing uh
got a combination of some early tomatoes
here
as well as some beef steak tomatoes and
one of the things i like to use for
these tomatoes when you do a lot
it's it's handy to use a tomato shark
that's a tomato shark right there
uh it's just so fast you give a twist
like this and the the
stem part comes out it's faster to
process tomatoes if you're doing a lot
of plum tomatoes
if you grow your own or whatever it's
just quick you give it a twist
that's it rest of tomatoes all usable
even on these big tomatoes these big
beef steaks
uh let me see this is probably the
ripest one i've got here
beautiful tomato look at that baby so
this thing digs right in
easily grabs the stem removes it
the rest of this tomato is usable that's
a tomato shark
cool and i use them a lot in stock
chef depot.com be right back we're going

marinara pizza sauce

fresh tomato pizza sauce
