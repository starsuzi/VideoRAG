hi I'm going to show you how to get
paint out of your clothes so
unfortunately I have these brand new
anthropology pants they're such a pretty
rose color and I got a little bit of
paint on them I had an apron all the way
down to my knees and where does the
paint go right below the apron so
there's a little drip here and that's
actually some pouring medium plus the
paint
and then um I was doing a lot of
teaching and when I teach I don't like
to wear my grubbies so I wear my
teaching clothes and they get paint on
them but I can fix it so this I don't
even know what this is but I don't know
if you can see that there's some paint
on there some just crusted it almost
kind of Blends in but it's maybe some
brown with some medium and then on this
sweater or this shirt actually it I
don't know if you can see that but it's
just sort of a little shine so there's
no paint color itself it's just the
acrylic medium so I'm using um I'm going
to use some brush cleaner and restorer
to get the paint out of these things and
I've used this so many times I'm not
going to do the test on an inconspicuous
area but I advise you to do that if
you've never done this before because
you want to be careful um and not hurt
any of your garments but I've used this
stuff on cashmir sweaters and everything
so um so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to soak it first so
we'll start with this
guy so I'm just going to take
this and I'm going to
pour one thing too is if there's any way
that you can kind of scratch it off
sometimes the paint doesn't stick into
the fabric itself it's just on the
exterior fibers so um
of course I should have opened this
before I started doing
this I am okay that's good cuz I'll just
get a little drizzle okay so I'm going
to put that on there and it's going to
need to soak in for a while so what time
is it it
is
12 it's 12:20 so I'm going to come back
later and check on that and I'm going to
do the same thing with these so so I'm
obviously I want a generous amount on
here and I'm going to pour this on here
this stuff is non-toxic and
biodegradable which is super important
to me I try to avoid all toxic products
and um do whatever I can to
be as careful and as thoughtful of the
environmental impact of everything I do
so I eat organic and I use biodegradable
soaps and personal care products and all
that so all right I'm putting some on
there and I'm going to leave all this to
soak in this little saucer here I might
just because I want this to work the
first time for you guys so I'm going to
put a little extra in there that might
not that might be a little Overkill but
I'm just going to let it soak there all
right and I'll be
back okay so it's been about 45 minutes
let's
see yeah about 45 minutes so I decided
to come out and check and see how things
are doing here so I'm taking you could
do this with your fingernail but you
shouldn't and now I won't because you're
watching so I'm going to take this
pallet knife painting knife thing I have
I want a stiff thing and I'm just going
to kind of pick at it and see if the
paint's coming off and I feel like I'm
getting some movement
here see if you can see that
um feel like yep some of it's dissolved
this one I checked before I turned on
the camera this not so
much um little bits coming out of that
crevice there but I want to soak this
longer I still have hope for this even
though the color is a staining color
it's a phthalo
blue that's the news I have to break to
you different pigments will react
differently in the fabric and there are
staining colors and they will soak in
and even if you get all the acrylic
medium out with this cleaner
the color will have sunk into the fibers
and bonded to them and it just doesn't
come out so anyway I'm going to pour
more on here and let it soak
longer okay I'm back again so it's been
2 hours now it's
2:30 and I'm going to check on this guy
this was the most stubborn one last time
and um the thing is is when I have
stubborn paint on paint brushes I soak
them overnight so but look I'm getting I
hope you can see this try and move the
angle it's coming off
yippee G to get my pants
back um
okay yeah see look at that that's
acrylic so what I didn't explain before
when I'm talking about medium all paint
is a binder
which in the case of acrylic is acrylic
polymer emotion plus pigment so um even
if you hadn't added medium into your
paint and you got it on your clothes you
would still have acrylic binder in there
which is the same thing as acrylic
medium
so I don't want to ruin the
fabric this is this pouring medium is
the most stubborn of all the medium
so I'm actually pretty impressed with
this how it's coming up I think the best
thing really is the
thumbnail good old thumbnail
um okay I'm getting somewhere now this
guy I don't even see what was on there
anymore feels like it's pretty gone the
thing is oh here here's a bit or is that
something
else of course the fabric cuz I poured
all this stuff and it soaked every
little drop of it up
um I can't find the paint on
this I definitely can't find the paint
on this sleeve this is good these are
good to go so I'm going to wash these
other two
items and I'm going to take I'm going to
look for a toothbrush
this is coming off look at that I don't
know if you can get a good view of that
but I'm really really
pleased and I didn't I only soaked this
for two hours longer would be
better um and I might do that I might
just soak it a bit more and this time
put it face
down and I'll leave
that but I am ready to watch wash the
other things I'm super happy about that
it looks like a lot of this guy came
off um interestingly it looks like we're
going to
get there's a little wear on the
Corduroy
whales but it's way better than it was
before I'm very
pleased and I'm back to using
my painting knife and sparing my
thumbnail but I think the thumbnail is a
little more gentle for this but look at
that I'm going to just give it another
little splash while I'm working on it
cuz it soaked up overnight it's 8:00
a.m. the next
day do a little rubby
rub
wow I'm so excited
yay are you impressed I hope you are
because I am I don't know if that looks
as good to you as it does in real life
one more thing I wanted to say um so
just just uh in general if you get
acrylic paint on your clothes don't wash
them and put them in the dryer until you
try and get the pain out because the
heat will set the acrylic pain in such a
way that it'll make it harder to get out
anyway so this is the stuff I
used it's the Windsor Newton brush
cleaner and restorer I've tried a lot of
different products over the years I
everything pretty much that comes my way
I try it out and I used to use a kiss
off which is in a stick that was pretty
good you'd um wet the stain and rub it
on and kind of scrape it off sort of
like I just showed you here this is the
best thing I've found and the least um
you know no harmful to anything like
skin environment water Etc okay good
luck getting the paint off of your
article of clothing
