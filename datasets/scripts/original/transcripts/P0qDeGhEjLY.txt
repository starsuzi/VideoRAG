Here we have Wisteria a woody perennial
that needs regular pruning to keep
it in check and ensure good flowering
but unlike other woody perennials you
need to prune it twice a year, once at the
end of summer and then in winter and
that ensures that the wood will ripen
and you'll get a great floral show
come May. Well this is a Wisteria that's
ready for its late summer prune and you can
see all these wippy growths you need to
take back to the structure, here we've
got a great example and we want to take
about five buds we have got one, two, three, four,
five and that's where I'm going to make my cut
so by cutting this back I have allowed airflow
through the plant and sunlight to get in
and ripen up this wood therefore
allowing the buds here to develop
and produce more flower. I'm going to
carry on and take things back to five.
I will be back in late winter to do the second pruning.
It's now late winter and I'm back to give the
Wisteria its final cut
the long shoots we cutback in summer here, will now be reduced
further to two to three buds, this process produces
spurs which allows the fatter flower buds
to remain producing larger blooms
you can see the difference between those
buds the fatter flower buds and the
thinner leave producing buds, ok I'm
going to carry on pruning this taking
back to two
you can also tidy the plant up now
some of these lax growths would be good
to tie in to leave for next year to train
other wispy growths can be cut away
Wisteria needs regular pruning, ideally
twice a year to form those fat flower
buds, but if you miss it
late summer don't worry you can prune
back to two now, it's really worth
pruning your Wisteria to make the most of
those flowers
this is going to look amazing in three months time.
