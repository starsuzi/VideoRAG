okay so here's the problem somebody's
just walked tar into another person's
house and left these nasty marks of tar
on the carpet one name one name only on
dating
well there and so on so today I'm going
to try and remove this tarmac tar stain
from the Talmud and just okay here we go
right first of all I'm going to apply
some of this gel which is
this is coming up very slowly
oh no you don't just use all my spotter
as a final rinse procedure I'll use a
water extraction machine
this talk
there's a clean spot
oh it's not looking like new
Oh
got that one to do that was to do that
was a bit and won by the double
hey that's how you remove from a carpet
okay so here's the same area that this
time all the tar is removed and see
where the edges are
still damp in the middle and I need to
clean the early edges but the main
problem is being removed
no tar marks left when yeah there's a
line of ways being cleaned go all the
way up yeah all out okay and that was
the best one I didn't think that would
command the finished product to see well
you now you can't see any tar max that's
the area in front of the door that was
quite bad and you can't see now where
I've cleaned the stain from and the rest
of the carpet
well it looks exactly the same and all
the tar you moved through yeah I don't
quite pleased with that one
