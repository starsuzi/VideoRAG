The health benefits and uses of dandelion
leaves.
1.
Dandelion is a wildflower originally from
Europe, Asia and North America.
They now grow all over the world.
2.
They are known by many as weeds, but they
also have some wonderful health benefits which
you may not be aware of.
3.
Dandelion leaves are very high in calcium,
which is very important for the body to maintain
strong bones and a healthy nervous system.
4.
They are also rich in iron and anti-oxidants
preventing dark circles under the eyes.
5.
The root of the dandelion has been shown to
treat people suffering with leukaemia.
6.
In order to enjoy these health benefits, you
can eat dandelions including the leaves in
a salad.
However they often taste bitter, so I recommend
making dandelion leaf tea.
7.
To make this, simply chop a handful of dandelion
leaves and steep in hot water for 5 minutes.
8.
I recommend also using the flowers and the
roots in this tea, be sure to clean them thoroughly
before use.
9.
Dandelions also contain a high dose of vitamin
K, which has been linked in the prevention
of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
10.
You can also use dandelions in a delicious
smoothie with other fruits, and vegetables
seen in our other videos.
11.
The leaves also contain copper.
Potassium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc and
magnesium, which are all included in the recommend
daily allowance, for good health.
12.
As well as Vitamin K, they also contain Vitamin
C, B1, B2, B6 and E, making dandelions a wonderful
natural multivitamin.
13.
All essential amino acids are present, making
them perfect for a leafy green source of protein.
14.
Those who suffer with eye strain, and have
problems such as macular degeneration, can
use dandelions to reduce symptoms and prevent
further damage.
15.
Dandelions grow throughout the spring and
early summer months, and can be harvested
from almost anywhere.
16.
You can store them in an air-tight container
in the refrigerator, or dehydrate them for
long term storage.
17.
The tea has been shown to settle an upset
stomach and reduce intestinal gas.
18.
The anti-inflammatory effects treat muscle
aches and joint pain.
19.
Dandelion leaves effectively stimulates the
gallbladder, therefore purifying the blood
and reducing the risk of gall stones.
20.
They raise HDL levels and therefore control
cholesterol levels in the body, helping to
maintain a healthy heart.
21.
Did you know that dandelions are asexual,
meaning they can produce their own seeds without
pollination.
