plain flour with baking powder added
then castor sugar or super fine sugar
and then tapioca flour this will thicken

eggs now add milk powder and a pinch of
salt mix

the dry mixture in this Shaker is
something you can reuse again and again
make the waterline with a permanent
marker and pour in the water and shake
shake shake always keep instant pancake
mix on hand more affordable and
