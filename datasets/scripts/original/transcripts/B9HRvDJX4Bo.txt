hi I'm Don Revis and I will be showing
you how to clean and disinfect baby
furniture for this job you'll need a few
things first I like to use disinfectant
spray and let it set for 15 minutes that
way it gets the full effect paper towels
that way you can throw away all the dirt
and grime that you don't want to stay
around and a wet washcloth to make sure
that you get all the chemical residue
off and have it be safer for your baby
now with a toy like this
um some of them come off and I prefer to
wash them in the sink just like you
would sanitized dishes with soap and
water and with 2 tbsp of
each let me get all these off
here and I'll spray down everything
that's PL
being careful to flip every
page babies love to set on
things let it set for about 15 minutes
that way it gets the full
effect and now I like to wipe it down
with my paper towel
[Music]
and don't be stingy on the paper towels
because the more paper towels you use
the less germs are going to be spreading
around and now as added safety I like to
wipe it down with a wet washcloth um to
make sure that any chemical residue is
gone U so that your baby doesn't get
that in his
mouth I'm done Revit and this was how to
clean and disinfect baby furniture
