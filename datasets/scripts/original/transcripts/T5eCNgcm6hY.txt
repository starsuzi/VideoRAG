To correctly cook barley, start with a pan
on medium-high heat. Next, take your barley
and pour it into the pan. The barley is going
to expand about two to three times its size
so you want to make sure that your stock pot's
big enough to hold that. Allow your barley
to toast for just a second it'll help bring
out the nutty flavor. Once your barley is
toasted go ahead and add about two times the
amount of liquid. I like to use chicken stock
or beef stock, it helps bring out extra flavor
within the product. Next, bring your liquid
to a boil and then a simmer. Allow your barley
to cook thirty to forty minutes until it's
nice, soft and chewy. Barley, when it's complete,
should have looked like its expanded about
two to three times it shape. It's also got
a pearled look to it. And that is how you
cook barley.
