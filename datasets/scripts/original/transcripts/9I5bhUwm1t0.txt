today I'm going to show you how to turn
an ordinary
egg into this really cool squidgy
translucent
EG which even
bounces it's made by basically
dissolving the shell from an uncooked
chicken
egg start by putting your egg in a
glass then take some white vinegar
and pour it into the glass to cover the
egg you can see that straight away small
bubbles start to form around the entire
egg what's happening is the acid in the
vinegar starts to react with the calcium
carbonate eggshell and slowly dissolves
it the chemical reaction produces these
carbon dioxide
bubbles
as well as the egg in the glass I'm also
going to do three additional ones just
in case we need
spares and we need to leave them soaking
for about 24
hours after 6 hours you can see the
shell is already getting soft and the
outer layer is starting to
dissolve it's also really slippery so do
handle it
carefully and if we check the other
three we can see they're the
[Music]
same once we've left them for 24 hours
you should find the shell has pretty
much completely dissolved and they're
held together with a very thin membrane
which was underneath the
shell they really are slippery so do
handle them
carefully you might need to rub off any
remnants of the shell and wash it off in
the
vinegar you can see this one still has a
bit of a white
coating but when you wash it off the egg
is slightly translucent and you can see
the yolk in the
[Music]
middle if you do need to wash off any
remaining shell handle them very
delicately and do be careful because the
membrane holding them together is very
thin the one I made in a glass didn't
survive unfortunately and I think it may
have cracked when I dropped it off off
the spoon earlier but the shell did
dissolve and left us with this thin
membrane which was holding it all
[Music]
together if we take a closer look at
these eggs we can see there's an amazing
pattern on
them they are slightly squidgy and
they're very
[Music]
delicate if we dim the lights and shine
a flashlight through you can get some
really cool
[Music]
effects this one reminds me of the
moon what is fun is that despite them
being delicate they are just about
strong enough to
bounce pretty cool
huh I thought I'd try it over a plate
and see how high they can Bounce
[Music]
from Splat that was about 30
cm and here we can see the membrane
which was holding it all
[Music]
together unfortunately I broke one of
the others earlier on
and I dropped the other one by mistake
when I wasn't filming so this one was
the only one I had left to
[Music]
