how to feel like eating breakfast first
thing in the morning everyone tells us
that breakfast is the most important
meal of the day and that it's irregular

stodgy cereal and plates of dry toast

skipped until they feel their stomach
has woken up later on the day

or a bad night's sleep can make us feel
nauseated and bloated this will start
off feelings of hunger until later in
the morning when tiredness begins to be
mistaken for hunger

morning if the thought of cornflakes
pop-tarts or toast as you reaching for
the car keys with an empty stomach it's
time to bury your choices
