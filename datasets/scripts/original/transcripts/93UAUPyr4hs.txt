what sup YouTube um today I'm going to
make a pipe I'm not going to tell you
you know what to use it for but I use it
for
marijuana um it's made out of a
ChapStick tube just a simple chapstick
tube and I'll show you how to make it
all right so first you get a chop buy a
chopstick tube and you take out all like
the Chapstick part and then you grab
some pliers and pull like the
whole like plastic little uh bar that's
in there you pull it all out from the
backside along with the little thing at
the end that you spin so it comes out so
it's completely
Hollow then you get a just a simple
lighter and you heat up one of the
sides it's kind of melted you see that
you heat up one of the sides and you get
like a knife or whatever
and when it's hot it bends and like you
can carve it kind of so uh yeah you just
heat it up and then you make a hole to
the size of your attachment you it's
just a wrench
attachment it's metal um the size is
1/4 and it's just it's just a a wrench
attachment you put the skin
end you just get the skinnier end of it
right here and you put it into here and
it fits perfectly it will not come out
no matter what you do it will not come
out unless you pull it out all right so
you put the cap back
on and there it goes now what you do is
on the back side not the cap side but
the back side you
get a headphone and you break it apart
and once you break it apart you take
this um netting that's on it and
basically you just glue it right on
here it's inside like it looks like this
it's inside like every headphone and you
just glue super glue it right to the
edge and it will not come out as well
and it's waterproof and everything so
that's your pipe and I'll demonst
straight it right
now all
right hold up let me light this [ __ ]
up all right so yeah you just light it
up right here it burns and then you suck
in through
here
that's how you do it and then for clean
up you just take this
out wash it under some
water and none of your weed goes in here
but if it does you can just open this
clean it out and you're set for another
day thanks for watching rate subscribe
