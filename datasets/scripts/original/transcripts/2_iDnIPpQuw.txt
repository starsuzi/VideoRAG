and we've done the wash we've done the
wheels and we've done all kinds of stuff
to this Thunderbird now we're going to
do the buffing um actual polishing of
the paint and as you can see the car is
very faded make sure and click in the
I'll put before this some links to the
detail and wash and all that um I'm
going to show you a quick up close on
the paint and just make sure and add
your comments down below like subscribe
and all that I've got lots of videos on
detailing and I've got lots of Classics
for sale plain and simple about 150 of
them right now to be exact not just the
ones you see I can count two there's
only about 40 here so here's the
Thunderbird it's a 93 super Coupe
supercharged and what we're going to do
on this one today is actually a wool pad
can you grab one of the Foams Nick and
I'll show you the foam in case you're
not in tune with what it is and a rag
that we're going to use to wipe it
down and so this wool pad you've got to
figure is very very aggressive um unless
you're doing something that has very
messed up paint you really probably
don't need an aggressive aggressive pad
like this and to give you an
idea can I get that nice green one in
there or something even something just a
little less um hard all right to give
you an idea you can see this paint's all
faded faded
faded this is not we just did this one
as well and I would not put a wool pad
to this I just wouldn't you can see all
the reflections and stuff and actually
um Nick just got done hand polishing
this out a little bit and I would
not put a wool pad on this it'll leave
you with so many swirl marks it's
pathetic now on the other hand my baby
here that is faded faded faded faded I
would wool pad the hell out of this so
just as a kind of difference you can see
all the clear coats burn off I can't
wait to get this thing going and leave
it and just drive it like this to where
everybody thinks it's a piece of junk
and then all 670 horses just blows them
off the road so here's your foam pad and
there's a couple different grits of this
I would say this is probably about I
don't know
1,500 like maybe maybe 4,000 grit 3,000
grit and this is like 7,000 grit and
then there's another one that's like
10,000 I don't know let's just say this
is the grittiest of the gritty okay
here's our paint I'm going to hand the
camera off to Nick and I'm just going to
start and kind of half this thing right
now to where you can see what we're
doing and I'm going to take a test shot
Nick got to be able to get right up on
this to where I'm not splashing on him I
don't want to wax my camera all up so
with that in mind here we go
and that show right up on it when we're
do it I guess on your first run
[Applause]
through well I got to get something and
I just put that face down God Dam
it
[Applause]
everything's moved I lost
track and I have talked before about
putting these face down like this you
don't do it don't put them in the dirt
but if you do it's not the end of the
world either especially on a car like
this clean the thing up a bit get
yourself a
wrench and they actually make a spur for
this it makes it way
[Applause]
easier we don't need no stinking
Spurs you can see what's happening here
and I'm
sorry but there ain't no dirt sticking
to this thing if I got anything in it
when I touched the ground it's
gone so I'm very confident number one
now that I've got a cleaner pad number
two there no dirt now it shouldn't take
a whole lot of this plain and
simple I've already shaken it
up like I say your first time it's going
to be kind of
dry and some of this that there no clear
coat on it is really going to soak it up
hit up any of your edges
and that's the
first and on the flat fox keep this as
flat as you
can
now with the car is faded as this one
I've got a little bit of wax on the pad
now so we're actually going to start
moving this thing the way it
should with one as faded as this one
you're going to be able to get a little
bit more
[Music]
RPM and you can hear it there
too
just kind of roll the edges
[Music]
softly and always always always try to
keep all your rags
quartered
up the best quartered up rag you can
have the better whoa watch
this that's amazing and if you could
only feel how this is compared to watch
the minute I hit that
line it's over so that's that I want you
to show this up close well we might not
get as much more of it because we're out
of maybe back up a bit cuz I'm going to
spray at
[Music]
it maybe
di
okay okay so we had the camera battery
give out this happens to me on about
everything but the camera's cooled off
now and you can see that one spot woo
buddy that looks good I'm G to finish
this half for you
and we'll do it to it and kind of get
back and show you what's
[Applause]
up I absolutely love buffing on these
cars throwing the cord over your
shoulder I forget a thing or two when
I'm making a video cuz I'm too worried
about what's going on there here and
everywhere as long as you're careful on
this edge
here I tested it out and I can put as
much pressure on this as I
want
yeah that's right I didn't miss a
beat show this up close if you would
these little marks you're
seeing get a little extra on there and
actually get them off
[Music]
there
that is imperfections in the paint
because grit and sand and grease and
grime has set on
[Applause]
there and when you wipe the heck out of
it afterwards it should come out looking
damn
nice keep everything looking good as you
go not only to where you tell can tell
where you've been but to where you can
tell how it's looking compared to the
rest of the car you don't want to start
getting different results and not notice
it if it's not looking even when you
wipe it now it's most likely it's not
going to look even
[Music]
later now that panel freaking looking
good what I'm going to do here is nail a
halfway mark down here
and buff the heck out of
[Applause]
it rub this stuff around a bit first and
honestly I'd rather go like this and
work with the whole
hat you can see it taking that clear
coat heel type look right off you can
show close up on that then marks just go
like
[Music]
crazy give it some
[Music]
pressure it doesn't take much but when
you got paint looking like
that I want to get it off now that's
what she
said
on emblems and stuff it's okay to shoot
the edge like that use the edge of this
to push against it a bit just don't push
too
[Music]
hard
eaw I hate to be proud of what I'm doing
here but
damn looks good and this is one of my
favorite things to do no matter what if
it's hot out I don't care if I can still
buff and it looks good it is a fun fun
process to change something
to look as good as you can make things
look now as you're going on this kind of
stuff be
thorough do as much as you can at the
same time I'm doing everything but the
bumper and I'm going to come back at it
as a matter of
fact I'm going to do this bumper before
I hit the top part where you can see on
a fiberglass more plasticky piece like
this what
happened now I just kind of let it roll
over the edges and don't get too much
pressure and that really seems to work
well after you do that it's just
important
to hit up the flat spots again as
well just like
this you're always want to going to want
to do by
hand
[Music]
and another warning if you've never used
this type of buffer be careful it can
really screw your paint
[Applause]
up he is like this that have a grain to
it you don't want to get too much on
because it's going to really throw the
watch down in the
[Music]
Grain and a final on
headlights we are going to San these
later but at the same
time
I'm going to do this one just to show
you how I would do
them
[Applause]
okay
