The basic use for sew-on snaps is to hold overlapping edges together.
They are nickel plated brass and come in various sizes.
There is a flat surface on one side and a rounded surface on the other.
From the back, push a threaded needle through so it comes out one of the 4 holes on the edges of the snap.
Go in and out of the fabric several times to wrap the thread around that side of the snap.
Then move on to the next hole and continue until the snap is attached on all 4 sides.
Knot the thread on the back and cut off the extra.
Do the same for the other half of the snap.
