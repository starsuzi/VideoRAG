so i was just saying that sometimes you
know there's
all kinds of drama is going on in this
world and people are
uh
you know
i find a facebook a great entertainment
value also because you can see our i'm
not being judgmental that you can see
that person's drama playing out but you
can see the human drama play out you can
see so much of projection you can see so
much of uh
you know trauma and you know the the
drama queens and people projecting a
certain reality
and uh and of course people sharing some
wonderful stuff as well
so but it's great entertainment value of
you know facebook as as it is other
things
um
and even in our everyday life
you can see your friends and so-called
friends and
your neighbors and everything
playing out as if it's a skit and you
must take some time out and really
for me it's really essential that i
connect with myself we get so entangled
with the outside world and what's going
on who said what who did what
and it's such a distraction and it has
nothing to do with your own
inner world it has nothing to do with
your own personal growth your personal
growth will not happen when you look at
what another person is doing but it'll
happen when you're deeply connected with
yourself
for me it's so important to take time
out whether it's once a day or
maybe some time out in the week to
really be with myself to take stock of
my own inner environment
and really honor myself with what i'm
going through what i'm thinking what i'm
being rather than being engaged in the
outside world as
you know it's it's become the latest
distraction it's like the pokemon go
uh of the adult world you know where
you're constantly looking for something
and not really looking at what you have
you
