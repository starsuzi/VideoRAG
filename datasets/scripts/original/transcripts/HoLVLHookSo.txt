hey guys
difference between
blending stumps and dry brushes
explains all the pros and cons of using
a blending stump and dry brush for blending
so let's find out which one is
better
so here we have a soft synthetic watercolor brush
of size 5/8
and the manufacturing company is Bomijia
and we have a blending stump of size 4
and is manufactured in a local company in pakistan
and now we are going to compare
these two blending equipments
to see the difference between them
and for shading
purpose I am going to use this effiel's B pencil
Eiffel is also a local
manufacturing company in Pakistan
the paper I use in all of my drawings is
an ordinary hard white chart
because I prefer not to
 waste money on those expensive drawing sheets
so let's start by 
adding 2 consecutive shades with B pencil
I'm using this Back & Fourth stroke
technique for shading
I will try my best to keep both the shared shame
in order to get pure results
so the shades are ready
now I am going to blend this shade
with a blending stump
but first I'm going to clean this blending stump
so that we can get some better results
and our stump is clean
let's blend the
shade using this scumbling technique
so as we're done with this blending stump
shade
let's move on to dry brush technique
I already cleaned this dry brush with a tissue paper
so don't worry about the color
it's the permanent color of this brush
and here you go
I hope you can see the
difference between both the shades clearly
let's zoom in a little to see more details
as you can see we 
got some stain like textures here in this shade
and the reason behind this is that
blending stump always requires some
pressure against the paper to work
efficiently and to blend the shades
whereas the brush doesn't require any
pressure on the tip and you can use it
the way you want you can even blend the
graphite powder more efficiently with a
brush
here's an example of blended
graphite powder I use this same brush
technique to add the background in this artwork
so make sure to try it yourself
