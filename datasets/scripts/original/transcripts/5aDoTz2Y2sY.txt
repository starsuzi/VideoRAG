STANDING WATER IN THE YARD AWAY FROM HOME
Without the right drainage system, rainwater
and landscape runoff can puddle in low spots
in your yard, creating a muddy mess that can
kill your grass and attract mosquitoes and
other pesky insects.
If left untreated, this drainage problem has
the potential to grow, destroying your lawn
and landscaping work, and potentially leading
to property damage as the water makes its
way to your home.
Instead of using a properly installed drainage
system, many homeowners try quick-fixes such
as moving dirt or digging trenches, and end
up dissatisfied because these approaches are
most often ineffective and temporary.
Installing an NDS drainage system such as
Flo-Well and EZ-Drain can protect water from
puddling in low spots in your yard.
Flo-Well and EZ-Drain capture and retain excess
surface water before allowing it to naturally
percolate into the ground.
With NDS you can create a lasting drainage
solution easily and inexpensively.
