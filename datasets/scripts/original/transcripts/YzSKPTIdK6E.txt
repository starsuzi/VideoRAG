in conclusion two helpful tips from LEM
one when you grind your meat make sure
it's 40 degrees or colder grains much
better does a much better job when it's
lower temperatures the second is cleanup
one you can certainly get from LEM our
grinder cleaning kit that includes
brushes that are especially helpful when
you do plates and blades and you can
also run dry bread through the grinder
does a great job as far as cleaning up
in conclusion thank you very much you
can also go to LEM products.com for any
additional information thank you
