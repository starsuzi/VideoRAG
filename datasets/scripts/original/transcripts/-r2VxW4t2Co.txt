Trapping and baiting are the two best methods
for gopher control.
Both rely on timing and proper placement for
the best results.
Gopher traps can be placed in lateral tunnels
or in main tunnels, just make sure to place
them in fresh mounds.
Fresh mounds are taller, uncompacted and soil
color is darker.
Trapping can be done year round.
For main tunnels, find the soil plug in a
fresh mound which should be about a foot away.
Dig a hole large enough to place a trap inside.
For best results place two traps facing the
opposite way.
Attach them to stakes with thin wire making
it easier to locate.
Replace the dirt to block out light and air.
Check at least once a day in the morning and
evening.
For lateral tunnels, find the freshest soil
to locate the entrance.
Dig a hole large enough to place a trap.
Place about a foot into the mound, attaching
to a stake with thin wire, so you can locate
it easier.
Don’t plug the hole.
The air and light will alert the gopher to
a breach in the tunnel.
They will try to re-plug the entrance, and
encounter the trap.
Poison baits are the alternative to trapping.
Find the main tunnel by using a probe.
Dig a small hole, apply the bait with a long
spoon, and recover the hole.
Make sure to not cover up any of the bait
with dirt.
Baits should be effective within a few weeks.
Re-application might be needed over the course
of a few weeks.
Check for new fresh mounds, which will be
an indication of baiting success.
Follow the label for rates and application
instructions.
