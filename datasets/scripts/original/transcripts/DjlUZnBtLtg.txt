of pan the organizer so on today's show
i'm gonna show you how to wash your car

so no more swirls no more scratches and
everything's done in four simple steps
so without further ado let's go ahead
and start the show
[Music]
so hey guys i'm pan welcome to the show
i hope you guys are having a great day
so today i'm going to show you how to
wash your car without touching it so
i've been detailing cars for over 20
years now
and i can tell you through my experience
that over ninety percent of the swirl
marks and the scratches that you see on
your paint
come from when you're washing or drying
your car so today i'm gonna give you and
show you
four easy steps on how you can wash your
car without touching it
and that way we're to minimize the
chances of getting swirl marks or
scratches
so it's important to note that this
technique is to be used on cars that are
well maintained
so cars that are often washed or that
are very
lightly or to medium levels of dirt so
like on my 2018 bmw m550i that i take
care of a lot
so this car is often washed once or
twice weekly so this technique is not to
be used on heavily soiled cars or if
you're coming back from a rally with
lots of dirt or lots of mud so the
technique is quite simple and it's in
four easy steps
so step number one we're gonna rinse the
vehicle with the pressure washer
step number two we're gonna foam the
vehicle with a snow foam
step number three we're gonna rinse that
off and step number four we're gonna
dry the vehicle so this is very quickly
done so you can do the entire vehicle in
roughly 15 to 20 minutes and the good
thing about it
is you're not even touching the paint so
you don't have to break out your buckets
and your wash mitts and a bunch of other
stuff and products and equipment
it's very simple so a couple of quick
pro tips for you before we start
make sure that you work in a shaded area
or in a garage if possible
if you're to work outside choose a
cloudy day or work towards the end of
the day or at the very beginning of the
day
before the sun is at its brightest at
around noon because when that happens
while your products are going to dry way
too quickly on the paint
you're going to get water spotting
issues and it's not going to be a fun
and enjoyable experience
by the way guys if you want to learn
more about car detailing you found the
right channel
so from the beginner to the diy
enthusiast all the way up to the
professional
i have tons of videos and tutorials for
you so
from washing your car inside and out all
the way up to advanced techniques like
paint polishing and applying waxes
paint sealants and also ceramic coatings
i got you guys covered i even do
product reviews and also equipment
testing so make sure you check
and browse all my videos later so the
equipment that you'll need to do the job
is actually very simple and to make it
simple for you i made sure to include
the links to all the products and
equipment
in the description under the video for
you guys to check them out
and i also included some cheaper
alternatives to the equipment or
products that i use
to make it very easy and cost effective
for you guys
so first of all you're gonna need a
quality pressure washer
so my unit here is a cransla 1122 tst
from germany but they're also very good
brands out there that are less expensive
such as karcher sanjo so on and so forth
then you're gonna need a foam cannon so
this is the item in which you're going
to put your foaming solution to spray
onto the vehicle
so in this case my high-end version is
the mtm pf22
but you can also get some cheaper
alternatives that also do a great job
like this try nova foam cannon
to put in the foam cannon you're going
to need your snow foam so that's a soap
that's been specifically formulated for
using
to be used as a pre-wash so for example
we have chemical guys honeydew very good
one
we have adam's car shampoo so this is
essentially a car shampoo for your
normal washing but can also be used
as a foaming pre-wash snow foam and
on the higher end of the scale we have
griot's garage
foaming surface wash now the
particularity of
these three foamers are that they are ph
neutral
so they can be used outside in direct
sunlight of course as always make sure
you try to work in the shade or in a
garage as much as possible
but if you do work outside at least
these guys will not be leaving
any water spotting on your vehicle so if
you do get water spots that's because
you have hard water
or you let the water dry too long on
your paint but these products again are
ph neutral so there's they're safe on
waxes
pain sealants and also ceramic coatings
and they do a very good job
so once you're done foaming the car and
then you're done rinsing it
you're gonna need a car dryer or a
cheaper alternative is a leaf blower if
you guys have one
so i have the big boy here this is the
metrovac master blaster revolution
it comes with a very long 30 foot hose
so as the name states this is a car
dryer
twin engines in there peak 8 horsepower
so very very powerful
so you can dry anything from paint to
glass to plastic trim
remove any water that's in your mirrors
in your door sills door jambs in the
grilles
on your wheels and tires this will do a
great job and again prevent you from
having to touch the car to dry it
a smaller brother to this one if you
don't want to spend the extra money
is the blaster sidekick so again from
metrovac this is the portable version
it's meant to be used as a motorcycle
dryer but
you can also use this as a car dryer you
just have to work a bit quicker to make
sure
the water doesn't dry on your paint but
it's also very good
both units come with rubberized tips so
they won't damage the paint
if you accidentally touch it so they're
a very good means
of drying the vehicle very quickly
without touching it all right so enough
with the talking and let's get started
all right so let's start by assessing
the state of the paint as you can see
lots of bugs and bug guts on the front
bumper
the wheels and tires are dirty thanks to
brake dust
the paintwork is actually dirty it's
been through a couple of rainy days
you can see on the mirrors here more
bugs and bug guts
the door sills and side skirts they're
all pretty dirty
and the back bumper lots of water
spotting there
so step number one is to thoroughly
rinse the vehicle using a pressure
washer
anything between a thousand to two
thousand psi is very safe
for use on vehicles work from top to
bottom and this step
will help to remove pretty much 80 to 85
percent of the loose dirt and
contaminants
step number two is to foam the vehicle
with a snow foam and a foam cannon
inside the foam cannon i typically add
one to two ounces of soap
with 18 ounces of water for a 1 to 10
dilution ratio but check your label to
make sure you have the proper dilution
ratios
i let the snow foam dwell for roughly 5
to 10 minutes never apply indirect
sunlight
and as you can see the snow foam helps
to encapsulate and lift
the loose dirt and contaminants off the
surface and onto the ground flushing it
away
step number three is to rinse the
vehicle thoroughly once again so once
your snow foam has had enough time to
dwell
and to do its cleaning action where you
go ahead and you rinse from top to
bottom
revealing a nice finish and the next
step
so step number four is going to be to
dry the vehicle so in this case i'm
using
the car dryer but you can also use a
leaf blower so that's a least expensive
less expensive alternative so
essentially you're not touching the
vehicle always wear protective ear muffs
because these things tend to get pretty
loud or if you have noise cancelling
headphones and you're listening to music
that's fine as well
so in a couple of minutes you'll have
dried your entire vehicle
and it's going to be ready to present
the the final results
so it helps to dry the car even quicker
if your paint is protected by
a wax a pain sealant or like in my case
a ceramic coating
because water beads off and sheets off
extremely quickly
now another pro tip you all know that
you get rusty
rotors or brake discs once you're done
washing your car so the trick
to alleviate this issue is to drive back
and forth a couple of times in your
driveway
while lightly applying the brakes and
that's pretty much it you're done no
more brake dust or surface rust on your
discs
so we can look at the final results here
as you can tell
no more bugs or bug guts the paint is
nice and shiny again
i say it's 90 to 95 percent clean
as you can tell there are no water spots
there
are no streaking or no residues and the
results are stunning
