you how to make the simple ninja star
what we do is we take an ordinary piece
of paper we're going to fold it so that
these two edges line
up like
so then what we're going to do is we're
going to fold this flap along this
seam like so now what we're going to do
is we're going to open that up fold this
down here so what we want to do is we
want to cut off this flap so what we're
going to do is if you don't have
scissors this is a really neat trick
you're going take your fingernails put
them together and then graze it right on
the edge of the paper there okay we'll
flip it over do it on both
sides then we're going to simply pull it
apart now that we have the square piece
of paper we're going to fold this in
half like so
then we want to tear this again so we're
going to use our fingernail
trick
so then we're going to go ahead and tear
this okay now what we want to do is
we're going to want to take this piece
of paper fold it in half this
way like so then we're going to fold it
in half again this
way now what we want to do is we want to
use that line to fold this piece of
paper along that edge you can lift this
flap to kind of help line you up I found
it helps and we're going to fold this
one this way in the exact opposite
direction now I want to keep this seam
tight so I P fold it right up against it
now we flip it over and we're going to
fold this side this corner down here but
the difference is I want a little space
of paper so I'm going to use my
fingernail to kind of space it and just
provide little bit of
spacing in there the reason for that is
to prevent the paper from binding when
we fold it
again we're going to do the same thing
over
here
fold that
in then we're going to take the other
sheet of paper and do the same
thing we're going to fold
this like
so we're going to fold it in
half we're going to fold these two this
is
a like so
and over here nice and tight flip it
over fingernail
space over so we fold it should be a
nice
fold this side we're going to fold
down and we fold that
back okay now that we have our two
sheets here they're identical as you can
see what we'll do is we will fold them
in here like this now for some reason
you fold this and you notice that it's
backwards that's okay too because all
you got to do is open them up and put
them face in and they will fold in in
this case we didn't do it we did them
identical so we will place them both
open face like
this close down then we're going to
close this side and and then close this
one and tuck it right in there just like
you would a
box and that is our ninja
star
