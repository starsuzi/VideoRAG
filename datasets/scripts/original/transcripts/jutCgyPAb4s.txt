hey guys it's marisha today we are going
to make something that we all long for
the perfect chewy chocolate chip cookie
i love chocolate cookies
but i don't like hard crispy ones i like
the big soft gooey ones so that's what
we're gonna do today let's get started
we have our standing mixer all set up
and ready with a paddle attachment we're
gonna start off by creaming our melted
butter and this is three quarter cups of
melted butter or a stick and a half make
sure that that's unsalted
now let's add a half cup of white sugar
and one whole cup of packed brown sugar
i'm gonna use dark
now that that's all in there we can
start to mix until it is well
incorporated
after about a minute or so i'm going to
add a tablespoon of vanilla extract
the vanilla adds a delicious flavor to
the chocolate it totally balances it out
almost like coffee does now we're going
to add our eggs we're going to use one
whole egg
and
the yolk of another egg
kind of just cracking one side
and carefully oh well okay
well there goes that
there we go
that never happens
to me
any other time any normal time
you would go back and forth and just
capture the yolk but i don't know what
happened but that's okay
okay let's take that out of there now
we're gonna mix this up until it's
delicious and creamy and you should
notice that it gets a little bit lighter
and a little bit fluffier
while your mixture is creaming we can go
ahead and start to sift our dry
ingredients together i have here a
little bit of parchment paper and you
can do this in a bowl if you would like
but this just allows you to kind of put
all the flour neatly into the mixing
bowl without any
mess unless you make a mess now we're
going to grab two cups of flour and
we're going to sift that out with our
other dry ingredients
and with the flour goes a half teaspoon
of baking soda
and a half teaspoon of salt
and we just sift all of that together
as you can see our sugar and egg mixture
has lightened in color a lot it is a lot
fluffier and it looks very very creamy
and delicious definitely creamed well
now we can add our sifted
powder
and salt
easily just by picking up this piece of
paper
and carefully carrying it to our bowl
now let's give that a mix but we don't
want to over mix this it is going to be
a soft cookie so we don't want to build
up too much gluten we're just going to
mix for a couple of minutes until we
don't see any more flour did i say a
couple minutes i'm in like a couple
seconds we'll see
okay
i don't see any more flour and it's been
about 30 seconds
now we're going to do the best part
we're going to add our chocolate chips
you will use about two cups of chocolate
chips i'm gonna use one okay
i'm gonna use one cup of chocolate chips
because
honestly the cookie part is my favorite
and when it's too much chocolate chip
i'm just like where's the cookie and
we're just gonna mix this by hand
really quickly
i just found some mini chocolate chips
so i'm gonna add a little bit of those
in there also
so we've got some big and some small
now you can make these as big as you'd
like but i didn't call them big chewy
delicious cookies for nothing
so we're gonna make these pretty big
so i'm actually going to use an ice
cream scoop
to make sure that they're all the same
size and my oven has been preheating at
325 degrees
and in case you're wondering what this
is that i'm putting my cookies on this
is a fondant matte and
i use it for
rolling out my fondant and all types of
stuff like that
and also for baking
let's see 9 13 leaving about four inches
between each cookie all righty these are
going to bake in the oven at 325 for
about 15 minutes or until they kind of
get brown around the edges everyone's
oven is different so just keep watch
my cookies just got out the oven and
they look and smell absolutely amazing
like they are perfect the centers are
very nice and firm but they're still
soft and they are just so scrumptious
looking so i've let these cool on the
pan for about five minutes now i'm going
to transfer them to a cooling rack
these are so perfect i just want you to
look at the bottoms look how perfect
they look they look store-bought
so now you know how to impress all of
your friends and your family make them
these big delicious cookies and let's
see how chewy and perfect they are
oh my goodness
oh snap oh my goodness it tastes so good
i love chewy cookies oh my goodness it's
