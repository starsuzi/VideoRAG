Hi, I'm Debra Lee Baldwin
at Jeanne Meadow's garden
Hello
I want to show you these
great topdressings that
Jeanne has
a palette of topdressings
of little shells and different
colored gravels and
ammonites
I love rocks
I love fossils
I love shells
And I like a variety
I get bored
And I use the little jars
as samples
I keep the assortment
so I can grab things
and find the absolute
perfect topdressing
and any accessories
rocks or fossils or shells
an arrangement might need.
I have a weird idea
What about the black glass?
I know we didn't want anything
too showy, but what if
you threw a little of that in there?
Because there's the black
in the pot
You do a double take
A double take
Yeah, I like that
You barely see it
it's mostly buried
It's just a little bit of
glimmer, and when
you do notice it
it takes your eye
to the black in the pot.
Sometimes it's those
things that surprise
you the most and
work the best.
We're going to go fossils
on this and just
make it just a real
special piece
When people look at
it and say, what is
that in there?
Some
fossils?
Yes it is.
Hey, if you've got
fossils, flaunt 'em.
You don't want to
see any dirt whatsoever
And that's hard with
ammonites because
they're all different
shapes and sizes, so
it's best to topdress
first.
Use a funnel
and pour your rocks
into that, and just
shake and direct them
where you want them.
Especially when you're
using something fine
like a sand, you definitely
don't want it up in your
plants.
Funnels are great.
We've got some rocks
down in the plant
Jeanne has these tweezers
that have that have that
bent tip
Sometimes a leaf flies
in or we saw a slug
Yep, and we can see how
that looks, it's a
beautiful ammonite,
and if this ones ends up
being too big for my eye,
I'll end up putting
smaller ones if I think
Oh, no, no
I know, I love it
Ok, but show us what
you were going to do
And I think that that's
lovely, I love that back there
And again, it just repeats
the pot, when people see
ammonites, that match
the pot, it's just the
wow.
This is a very nice
topdressing, and it's
not very expensive
Even though it's tumbled
it's surprisingly affordable
To repeat these bubbles
and circles with this
then perhaps just put a
few shells on top to bring
in the sea theme.
May I?
Yes you may.
So just enough so that
the eye catches them
and takes a second look
without it yelling
"I'm trying to be an
undersea-themed arrangement."
Because it needs to be
sort of open to interpretation.
Oh, look, it kinda goes with
the lines on the side of
the pot.
It sure does.
Might use a couple bigger
ones if we still see the
bottom dirt there.
