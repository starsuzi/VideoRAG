hello all right well this is my uh first
YouTube video and today I'm going to
show you how to easily plant some chili
seeds uh this is a very successful
method I've used it myself I've got some
great results this year already okay so
today we're going to plant kiss of Satan
chili this is the last one I'm planting
this season might plant a few more later
if some come out but at the moment
everything I've planted I've probably
had about a 90% success rate using this
and all my seeds every single one bought
off eBay relatively cheap okay so first
things first make yourself a cup of tea
it's just a
standard Value Supermarket tea bag we go
f your tea stick it in
there now drink the tea
lovely okay A little bit of the water
save from the kettle just going to stick
a little bit in
there then we're going to top it up with
some cold
water
okay now I'm try to do here is get a
temperature of about between 25 and 30°
which is what chilies need to germinate
so starting the tea off you know soaking
them in that sort of temperature
tempature and starting Peak pallets that
sort temperature good start for them
okay this food probe cost me about 22
off
eBay you can see probably slightly
higher than 30 so we get some more
okay it doesn't have to be exact we just
want it somewhere between about 20 and
30° you see that's dropping quite
nicely slightly above 30 just a tiny bit
more got
stir yeah we
our optimal temperature
jealous okay done that take that te bag
out there and we got our peep pellets
and just put the water in there so the
pee pets soak it
up take a few moments it's really good
you got kids it's great to see him
watching grow and stuff like
that okay take the
seeds get two out here
okay one two and put them in the
water like so so you can see got your PE
pellets at 27° in your chili seeds
soaking at about
27° it's back in the bag for another day
okay you can see these are growing but
still want a bit extra water
pet and we'll just stick a little bit
extra in not this chili seeds it looks
like I've got three in there by accident
never
mind these are only a well just over a
pound just over a pound Post in
packaging for 10 seeds so 2 at most
right these are my wife's cosmetic
tweezers as you can see they're quite
pointy at the end which is really
helpful when you're pushing your seed
down into the peak pet I'm just going to
let them soak a little bit
longer and then we shall Point them
okay do it easy graub one out it's the
wrong way around you kind of want the
pointy end to be facing upwards cuz
that's the end SE is going to come out
of and then just going to sh it in there
like
so it Fairway down cover it with a soil
P it down not too firm you want to like
really case it you just want a light
dusted at the Pete over the top of the
seed you
go that is
it name tags here Satan's kiss kisser
Satan I suppose it really
matters stick one of those in there
stick one of those in
there need make sure you use a permanent
marker cuz you don't want this rubbing
off and not knowing what your chili is
okay well I'll show you these and we'll
take them to the
propagator okay so this is uh my
propagator this is what you really need
if you really want to plant Jiles in the
UK honestly guys I cannot think of doing
it without a heated propagator
it is you know just first cold snap in
your house and it'll just kill your
seedling straight off stick them in
there the nice and hot nice and humid
again I got this off eBay think these go
for about 40 50 Quid in the shops just
kept searching somebody on the way home
from work selling one got it for 15 quid
picked it up there you go works
perfectly and you get a load of seeds in
there as well okay I'll show you some of
the previous ones I planted and show you
how they're doing all done with the
method I just showed you on the previous
two
seeds Okay as you can see in there quite
a lot some seriously hot ones got a
Butch tea scorpion there chocolate
ners orine ners Dorset ners also got
some quite mild ones i' got bird's eye
Perry Perry and I got some unusual ones
as well got Brazilian starfish
Peter
penis which uh if you don't know where
the name comes from I suggest you look
it up online large cherry and as you can
see there are
loads
loads I'm come through I would say the
ones I planted 90% are not have come
through got Scotch bonnets in the corner
they planted a week and a half after
everything else so the first one's just
coming through second one no sigh
the only one I haven't seen yet is the
fatali in the corner but it's F and came
through so I did two fatales only one
seems to have come through and the
little
uh trays in there they cost a couple of
quid from a garden center like I say
they stop your chil your PE pellets
falling over because they are very
unstable especially with the big name
tags sticking out of front of them when
you're trying to water them the last
thing you want is them to keep falling
over so yeah yeah they're really good
investment and all I did cuz they don't
fit exactly I just cut them up so I got
as many in as
possible propagate a thermometer he's
ridiculously priced in some garden
centers seen them go for 78 quid on eBay
seen them going for about n quid all I
would suggest is you don't go to the
main chain garden centers it's a nice
little garden Senter around by us
independently run I found this for sale
250 so you can pick them up like that
and like I say other garden centers in
the neighborhood they're charging £8 for
one of those not worth that 250 get it
no problem okay as you can see there's
probably no space for Satan's kiss so I
am going to take out two of the uh
plants that have not yet germinated so
fortunately there's a jalapeno orange
there and a Dorset ner I planted 10
Dorset ners think I think nine of them
have come up but uh it's not going to be
any great shakes if I lose one so I'm
going to remove those two and I'm going
to put a Satan's kiss in
there propagator nice healthy
30° you can tell it's working all the
moisture inside you will find that the
ones on the outside contain the moisture
but the ones on the inside get dry quite
quickly so with your pepet just ordering
water give them a water every day H
we'll see uh how these come back and
we'll check back in a week or so
