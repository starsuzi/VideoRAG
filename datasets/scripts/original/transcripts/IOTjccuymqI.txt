okay I already made one video but then I
said ah let me make another one because
I forgot to tell you this is the Texan
nut sheller you can open pecans Brazil
nuts English walnuts almonds filberts
and other nuts you can actually also use
a lobster legs and crab legs this is all
you
do bunch of pecans here let's see how
many I can do really quick okay you clip
off the
ends each
one all right after you clip off the end
then you just barely clip the
sides you can see it coming out hole
already all right that's it so now you
pull it apart shell it get the end
off clean the outside
out there's
one right there's two pieces but anyway
you see how quick that one went clip off
the end think about it you clip off the
end you can tell if it's going to be a
good nut or not yeah that one's a little
too deep you can see where I went into
it that's all right
so just really clip it if you can you
know the more practice you have the
better you'll get
anyway so this one I tore up a little
bit anyway cuz I guess I'm trying to go
too fast anyway here it's still guy
tastes good anyway all right there's
another
one clip off the
end off the other end there to catch the
sides let me see
there it
is all right peace
