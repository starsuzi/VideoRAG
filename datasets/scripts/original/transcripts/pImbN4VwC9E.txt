we have a circular disc with seven
distinct colors
we now connect it to a motor and switch
it on
and what do we see
the moment the disc is rotated very fast
we do not see the seven colors
distinctly instead we see white so
that's a magic let's understand the
science behind this magic
[Music]
we first draw a circle to make the disc
now we have to divide this circle into
seven sectors seven equal sectors so for
that what we need to do we need to make
sure that the angle subtended by each
sector at the center is approximately 51
degrees because the complete angle would
be 360 right so let's do that
[Music]
[Music]
so now we have divided the circle into
seven equal sectors now what we will do
we will color it with different bright
colors now these colors are very
specific so we are going to color it
with the pure colors that is violet
indigo blue green yellow orange and red
so these are the colors that we would
put
violet
[Music]
so once you have put all the seven
different colors so cut this circle out
of the sheet of paper to make this disc
now what do we do so that we are able to
rotate it we fix a pencil or a sketch
pen at the back side exactly at the
center so we have used fevicol and cello
tape to fix it here now very comfortably
you can rotate it
and when you rotate it faster you get to
see the white color
we have fixed the disc to the motor
and the two wires from the motor are
fixed to the two ends of the battery
placed on the battery holder now the
moment we complete the circuit
what happens
the disc starts to rotate
now this disc was first made by newton
and that is why this is called newton's
disk
now would you like to know another
interesting stuff here we saw that these
seven different colors together made
white color so did you know what
actually happened this is nothing but
additive color system that is
wavelengths of all these seven different
colors they added up to form white
if we put all these seven colors one
above another
are we going to get white
now what did you see so we have put all
the seven colors one on top of other and
instead of getting white we got black so
what did this happen
so now in this case also the colors
mixed up together to form a new color
but in this case this is not additive
color system instead it is subtractive
color system that is wavelength of all
the seven colors they get subtracted
from each other to form a new color and
that new color is black so in this way
we distinguished between additive color
system and subtractive color system so
when we talk about dispersion of light
when we see the rainbow when we talk
about the sunlight which is made up of
seven different colors we talk about
additive color system
i hope you enjoyed the newton's disc
and also got to know that white light is
indeed made up of seven different colors
so make your own newton's disc and share
