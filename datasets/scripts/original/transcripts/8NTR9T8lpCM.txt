foreign
we're here in a backyard
I'm gonna call this video
truth about garden edging
and we're
we're hired to clean up this yard
but
if you're buying
spending your money on this rubber
edging
and they're calling it a weed barrier
just like you to take a look at this
what we've been doing and this is a few
hours of work
if you're putting in rocks
you know around your fire pit
for your low maintenance design
I mean this is what you can expect
this is probably a few years of growth
and you could say well it wasn't taken
care of and this and that but intention
here is a low maintenance design and
if they're saying this is weed barrier
we're saying this is the truth
this is reality what happens
now I mean we didn't do a great job here
but we dug out this side
there's some old mulch here you see it's
all fungus and
all that white is
mildew
and we didn't do a great job redefining
this Edge you can see this edging way
down in here but I mean the grass was
all grown in but
if you can just kind of make
go with no edging
and make this
you know keep the grass
up here and
your soil down here
the weeds hit this air the grass hits
this air space
and uh it stops growing
we'll need a little maintenance but
personally I think it's less work than
you know digging grass out
just leaving it
we're just here to do a quick job
help these people out
they're older
you know they just need it brought back
so
it's not going to be a perfect job but
it's just gets it back into shape
thanks for watching
