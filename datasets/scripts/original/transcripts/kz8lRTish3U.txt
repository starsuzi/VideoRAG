hey beautiful home spaghettis here and
what is that
those are empty candle jars that are
being cleaned right now they have the
acetone in them because i am melting out
the glue that's holding the
candle wicks in but these are for empty
bath and body waste candles i also have
two more to do
these this one is a patriot candle
aromatherapy candle from
walgreens this is an everyday luxe
candle from tj maxx i also sell them in
marshalls and i'm going to clean those
out and show you how i do it here are
some of my supplies
i'll go over in a second but what i want
to talk about right now is why in the
world you would want to clean out candle
jars i am just doing this i'm sitting at
my desk watching a little in the kitchen
with david on my ipad and getting ready
to create myself some more candle jars
or i guess i should just say glass
storage jars because that's what they
end up being they work handle jars and
then they turn into this and as we all
know clear glass storage jars are
gorgeous they go with any decor and you
can use them for whatever you want i've
got q-tips and one i also have cotton
pads and one i keep it my makeup table
here's some push pins and another one
these are glass candle jars from bath
and body works these
are candle holders from tj maxx and
marshalls and when i was in the store i
said wow these look like they would hold
uh those bath bodies candles so this
brand which i said you find in tj maxx
and marsha's everyday lux i tested and
as you can see it sits perfectly on top
of
these candle jars so what i did
i tested it in the store then when i got
home use some clear candle dress i have
and these are on my desk and i love them
they hold my
pencils and pens my mechanical pencils
and then my regular pins on my desk
looks like i spent what 20
25 bucks for the set of them no
these were these two this was 4.99 this
is 3.99
that ends up being 10 total you know
with tax for the bases and then for the
clear tops and that was only because i
chose to buy these bases i could have
gotten some of the dollar candlesticks
from the dollar store and done this now
they wouldn't have been varying heights
which is what i really love but
i still could have done that and spent
two dollars total
and still had the glass holders for my
stuff you get my point you can create so
much with these candle jars you have
already paid for the candle when i get
some use out of it so we're gonna go
over the supplies i use to do this so
first
you want something to dig the wax out i
know a lot of people melt the wax
they'll put these in a pot of hot water
and melt the wax and then pour the wax
out i don't like to do that i find it
the wax it's easy enough to scoop it out
with the spoon i just start towards the
edge and scoop it out so i'll show you
how i do that
this is to try and pull out the
wicks and the wick the wick holder i
guess i should really say
before i use the acetone sometimes they
come out sometimes it doesn't if it
gives me a struggle then i put the
acetone in and then i use this to pull
the wicks out it's just a pair of
pliers i got these in tj maxx and
actually came with a little hammer and a
screwdriver cute set and then i have
some tweezers to help me peel off the
labels
on the front of the jars because of
course you want your jar to be free i'm
sorry about this focusing now
what
about the label some people leave the
label on if you think the label is
really pretty then go ahead and leave it
on by all means i don't like that
because i always just i just want the
jars now what i do
is if i am in love with the scent
and the candle is still fragrant which
is usually the case with bath inviting
with candles the wax is still extremely
fragrant
when you
when the candle is done it just you
can't burn it anymore
so
to get waxed hearts out of it now here's
some wax tarts i purchased just as an
example of what i'm talking about and
this i can't wait to burn this vanilla
sugar cookie but
you just use the label and put it on a
snack size ziploc which is why this is
here these are just a small snack size
because you don't really need a sandwich
bag because that would be a waste
because you wouldn't have that much wax
left you just need the snack size i put
this label that was on the jar on the
bag and then i put the wax in the bag
and so then you can just put this in a
tart burner and use it like a wax tart
and still use up every single bit of
your candle wax so beach cabana i had a
lot of wax left this really i really
like that smell good and fresh bamboo
kind of obsessed with this and
i wanted to get every single scrap of
the wax so that's what i did for this
one so that's in case if you have some
that you know oh my goodness i love that
scent i want to use it so that's the
only reason you would need those you can
use the label the labels for that and
the bags for that to keep that wax
that's what ziplock is for now the
bottom of the jar so like for example
here i like to take the label off now
the candles do of course have labels
that describe the candle scent and all
that kind of stuff on the bottom so
you would be amazed that what the labels
really do come off after you wash
them for the most part you have to scrub
i will say that but the like soon as the
labels get wet they are easy to rub off
i don't like being bothered rubbing them
off so what i like to use is this and
it's called glue gun and it is a label
remover that's exactly what it's for i
got this on the dollar store and by
accident i dropped a q-tip in because
that's what i used to apply it because
it's not a nozzle or anything on there
it's just like an open jar
but i use that after i get
the insides out i'll pour out the
acetone and then just kind of wipe them
out a little then i'll turn them upside
down and apply the goo gone let that sit
and then i take off the label on the
bottom then i wash the whole thing so
that's how i do my handles
i don't uh because i tried it the other
way
and it just really really got on my
nerves
i had to work too hard to get the label
off the bottom with the glue gun oops
i'm sorry
did i hit you i with the glue gun i um
i don't have to do as much work so
that's what i like to do so right now
i'm going to show you how i dig out the
wax
and
working a little bit with the labels
because a lot of i know a lot of people
worry about oh am i gonna be able to get
the labels off which is a legitimate
concern i totally understand that
because the last thing you want is to
deal with the labels and
that horrible sticky residue that comes
from having the labels on there now i
have noticed bath and bodyworks have
made their labels really easy to get off
you don't have any of that residue but
that's where the tweezers come in and
just work slowly if you really need to
then of course you can always use your
goo gone to do this and to get all the
label off but just work really slowly
i've discovered is the key
and i always use this to start the
corner
and then just take your time sometimes
it helps to pull
in this direction and just pull really
slowly
if you see some wax residue
not wax but sticky residue going on the
jar
back track
and use the actual label
to help pull up the stickiness
if you see any stickiness going onto
your candle jar
so the trick is to just go slow so see
and we got that one off yay
so that's i'm not saving this wax though
well i'm not going to save this
so we don't need to keep this label
otherwise it's still super sticky i
could put it on the back of something if
i wanted
so here the everyday looks
i just use this to start a corner
and to get my peel going this was
coconut and sugar
and it smelled incredible in the store
and i got it home and burned it and you
couldn't smell it all it really smells
good
like coconut and sugar unfortunately the
smell
you could not smell this candle i was
really annoyed
so here we go with another label off
then
i just start from the edge
and just dig out
and i find that the wax comes up
very easily
in chunks just the size of the spoon
like i'm not trying to do a lot at once
just take your time don't be in a rush
with it and you just can break off
chunks
and actually have a bag here on the
floor i'm dumping the wax in
if you were going to save it
you would just have your uh
ziploc bag ready to go
to dump the wax in
i'm going to dump this out right now
because it's getting kind of cool and
it's hard to deal with the
waxes left so as you can see
so i've broken out a lot
i'm just going to try and get this
last little bit now see there
the wet the wax
the candle
wick holder actually came out with the
wax so i don't even ha and that one the
both two of them came out with the wax
so i only have one
wick left in here and we'll see if that
ah the glue and this the glue in the
bath and body works ones
are insane so as you can see here
there's the wick
you see that
there's the wick and it just came right
out the wax if you have a lot of wax on
your spoon you can just scoop that out
in there empty candle jar super easy
so it does not take a lot of time maybe
a little elbow grease
to get the wax out
maybe
um
just be mindful that it is glass so you
don't want to put like all of your force
on it
if you feel like you know you're really
really really really struggling to break
the wax out you just want to be careful
and mindful that it is glass it always
helps to to like continue to dump the
wax out so you have a
clear view of what you're doing
well this is weird this to me
is mushed down a lot more this is a much
softer wax
than the other waxes i was just using
and again the wick just came out
from
pushing the wax out
so that was another one where i was able
to get a wick out
there's the last wick yep and that one
came out with the wax
so i do not have to worry about that
there
now this one i might put a little
acetone in some for some reason that
helps also get the wax out
whoops
so sometimes i do that
push the rest of this wax off of this
spoon
and we're ready to wash the jars
so there's two more to wash
this has a little wax on the side now i
have a sponge just for this that i'm not
actually going to use for any of my
dishes so if the wax residue stays on it
i don't have to worry about it
but
and i suggest you do that
don't get anything super abrasive
thinking you can scrub the wax out
you want a non-abrasive scrubbing sponge
because you don't want to scratch your
glass
so you know don't get like a brillo pad
or something because then you have
little streaks on your glass you don't
want that the wax the wax will wash out
of the glasses you will be amazed you
just want some hot soapy dishwater and
your glasses your jars will be super
clean for the lids if there's tons of
wax just wipe them out with wipe it out
with paper towel this you have to shine
up on a regular basis
but you don't have to worry too much
about the lids either i wouldn't hold
food in them
like something that's not wrapped but of
course wrapped candy or treats would be
perfect to keep in these as well
hey man let me ask you a question man
see if you know what's up
