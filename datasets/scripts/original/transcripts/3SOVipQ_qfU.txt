[Applause]
[Music]
hey guys this is Monster Mike and you're
watching monster Mike fishing
[Music]
so the first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna cut
around this bottle so this line right
here we're gonna start here and go all
the way around that's gonna be the first
step all right so this is how you
started
puncture a little hole just like that
and then we turn the bottle as we go
make sure you be careful with sharp
objects
just like that perfectly cut Circle time
for The Next Step alright guys so first
we're gonna Chum it up to make sure that
there's some fish here that we can catch
with the plastic bottle
so
we'll probably end up putting the bottle
maybe down there oh my God already so
you know what maybe I will be able to
put the bottle
around here yes so this is where I'm
gonna put my bottle
I'm gonna drop it right here guys look
at all these crazy Exotics
hey Mike you think we should put a
camera inside yes bro let's add a camera
inside since uh since a few people think
that this is fake yeah we'd be faking
this stuff guys this is gonna be like so
easy that even a googan can do it
after cutting all we're doing is getting
the part that we cut reversing it and
it's gonna be just like that so the fish
are gonna swim in the hole is big enough
for any size fish all right just kidding
I'm gonna make this hole a little bit
bigger I'm gonna puncture a little hole
right here
go
all the way around be careful
sometimes you know you don't have the
budget to have to buy a real fish trap
so you got to make your own
let's go this is how you bait it up not
a lot of people know how to bait up a
plastic bottle fish trap ball it up like
this like a ball and then you drop it
look
just like that you have to use the end
bread as well because what this does is
it catches the bigger fish hey Brian
since you're the cameraman you're gonna
set it up down there with the camera
give me that GoPro we're gonna have a
GoPro in here as well so you guys can
see the fish going in here you go
set it down just like that oh that's
cold it's cold cold oh it's cold is it
cold or cold cold it's cold guys this is
like a pool like would you guys swim in
here
too cold
it's cold cold that's like triple it
cold you don't you don't want a
shriveled cold there's no snakes
or is there
look at that all right guys we have a
plastic bottle fish trap with a GoPro
mounted inside you're not going to want
to miss this this is the best plastic
bottle fish trap ever Brian's sinking it
down

anybody can make a fish trap like this I
can't wait to see what we catch
