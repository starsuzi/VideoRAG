Administration of
rectal diazepam.
Things to consider.
Sometimes children with seizure
disorders can have prolonged seizures.
Longer seizures may
contribute to complications.
Depending on the student’s
seizure emergency plan,
medication for prolonged seizures
may be needed.
Given that when a child is having
a seizure, it can be a stressful situation,
it is highly recommended that
you familiarize yourself
with the student’s seizure
emergency plan beforehand.
Store the seizure emergency plan
in a location that is
easily accessible
during a seizure.
The correct dose of rectal diazepam
ordered by the healthcare provider
should be locked into place on the 
device by the dispensing pharmacist.
This is evident when the
green “READY” is visible.
Be sure to check expiration date
on the medication package.
Remember to keep healthcare
information confidential.
First aid
for a seizure.
Call for assistance if 
someone else is present.
Place the child on a flat surface,
such as the floor,
being sure not to move the child
any more than is necessary.
Turn the child onto their side
to allow vomit or phlegm
to be expelled
rather than inhaled.
Place something soft under the child’s
head to protect them from injury.
Identify that symptoms of a
prolonged seizure are present and that,
based on the child’s seizure emergency
plan, medication needs to be given.
Note time of
seizure onset.
Call for assistance if you
have not already done so.
Assemble supplies and
place on a clean surface.
Check the medication kit and the
medical order to be sure it is . . .
Also check to ensure the
medication has not expired.
Follow the
student’s healthcare plan
and ensure the appropriate
amount of time has passed
prior to administering the
student’s seizure medication.
Ask that another
school staff person call 911
or emergency medical services,
and notify parent.
Wash your hands
if possible.
Put on gloves.
Re-check the medication kit and 
medical order to be sure it is . . .
Make sure the delivery device
is in the “READY” mode.
While providing the student with
as much privacy as possible,
remove clothing
from buttocks
and drape the buttocks with a
blanket, pillowcase, or other barrier.
Push up on the cap with your thumb and
pull to remove the cap from the syringe.
Open the package
of lubricant.
Lubricate the tip by inserting it
into the lubricating jelly.
Move the student to a
side-lying position
with the upper leg forward
so the rectum is exposed.
Using non-dominant hand, separate
the buttocks to expose the rectum.
Using dominant hand, gently insert
the syringe into the rectum
until the rim is snug against
the rectal opening.
Push the plunger in slowly
counting to 3 until the plunger stops.
Hold the syringe in place after inserting
the medication and count to 3. 
Remove the syringe
from rectum.
Immediately hold the buttocks
together and count to 3 again.
This helps keep the medication
from leaking out.
Keep the student
on his or her side.
Keep blanket, pillowcase,
or other barrier in place
to provide privacy
for the student.
Note time of
medication administration.
If alone, and you have
not already done so, 
call 911 or emergency
medical services now.
Monitor seizure activity
and respiratory effort.
If breathing stops,
begin rescue breaths.
If breathing and heartbeat stop,
begin CPR.
Once rescue squad arrives,
inform them of medication administered,
including type of medication,
dose, and time.
Remember to dispose
of all used equipment and medicine
safely out of the
reach of children.
Remove gloves
and wash hands.
Document the date, time,
and dose of medication given,
in addition to what was
observed during the seizure.
Follow up with the parent or guardian
and healthcare provider as needed.
