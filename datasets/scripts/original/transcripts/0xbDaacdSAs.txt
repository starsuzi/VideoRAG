fold the fabric so that you have four
layers and this is going to be the side
of the pajamas we're not going to have a
seam in the
sides why bother and so I've placed
these Leisure pants on here and I have
folded them so that this is back section
so that this is the biggest part of pair
of pants is the back and
then I'm going to cut my Fabric and then
I'm going to show you exactly how that
looks okay I've gone ahead and I've cut
along the outline of the
pants and here on this line you can see
that when I got to this section I just
came straight
up because the elastic here is pulling
these so if you wanted to you could pull
the elastic out and um measure but if
you just go straight up here that's
going to work out
fine so that's all the cutting out and
that was great that only takes a few
moments I'll be able to make a casing up
here to be able to pass an elastic
through the top and at the bottom I have
fabric for a
hem so let me show you this opened up
when I open up the fabric this is what
it looks like this is going to be where
you would normally have a side seam but
we don't need a side seam on Leisure
pants they're just supposed to be
comfortable and it eliminates one Seam
for us and so now the very first step is
going to be to sew this
seam and this
seam okay I've gone ahead and I've sewn
both of these the front and the back
seam and I don't have a surger so I just
zigzagged along the edge so here's how
that looks we've got the seam on here
and we've got the seam done over on this
side okay so I'm going to take this
section and match it to that
section and I've brought the two seams
together and I'm just going to pin
that now from that section down I'm just
going to
match the
seams okay I match matched those seams
here and pinned them and then I pinned
down the two seams matching up the
fabric and now I just have to sew a seam
going
up and down okay I have sewn this seam
and I have
zigzagged and now the only thing left to
do is to fold up for the Hem and fold
down at the top for the
casing okay so now I folded down the the
waistband casing
and I'm just going to top Stitch that
but I'm going to remember to leave a
little opening right here so that I can
pass my elastic through and I have the
Hem folded up and I was lucky enough
that I had Salvage on both
ends but if you don't then it just means
that you just have to turn your fabric
down a little bit and then top
Stitch take a length of elastic that
fits comfortably around your
waist
and pass it through the
casing bring it all the way
around okay I've gone all the way
through make sure your elastic has not
Twisted inside the casing and then
you're just going to overlap the two
sides like that with a needle and
thread you're going to sew those two
sides
together like
that
