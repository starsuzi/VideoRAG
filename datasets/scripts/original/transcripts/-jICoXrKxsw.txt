and all the bread sauces is very
simple 200 g of breadcrumbs 600 M of
milk cloves onion kned
butter and the secret ingredient stock
pot and just a spice it up a little bit
nutmeg okay take our milk 600
Ms in the
pan take our onion
cut it in half a few
cloves
okay put that in there pinch of
nutmeg little knob of
butter and then we take our stock pop
chicken
flavor and so the stock pot is our
seasoning
so all we've really done is make a milk
stock bring that to the boil or scolding
lift out The Onion add the breadcrumbs
and just cook it and if you want to know
why chicken
stock
chicken roast Patridge turkey bread
sauce Works fantastically well lots of
people think making bread sauce is
difficult what is it it's milk a pinch
of nutmeg one chicken stock pot an onion
study with some cloves and a bay leaf a
bit of butter that said scold it lift
out The Onion in go the breadcrumbs and
that's the difference between having the
best Sunday lunch or just another Sunday
lunch so I'll take my onion out I've now
scolded my milk as you can
see there we are that's and so
now in goes our bread crumbs I mean a
roast chicken a roast
Partridge turkey without bread sauce to
me is not a turkey is not a chicken all
we do now is just stir it in and just
cook it out
slowly what you don't want you don't
want it too wet what you like it to it's
quite firm little cuz let's not forget
it's a bread sauce if you stick to 3:
one when I say
3:1 600 Ms of
milk 200 g of breadcrumbs
you won't be far wrong it's almost
foolproof and that's what we're looking
for and something that's very simple as
you've seen it takes 5 minutes 6 minutes
to
cook so that's ready
now The Jug which we had the milk in we
put it back
in cover with cing film and just keep
somewhere warm and then you've got your
bread sauce you see and it can be passed
around the
table
