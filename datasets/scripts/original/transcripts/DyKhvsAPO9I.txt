Hey guys, let me show you how to safely flambe.
Flambe or flaming adds a great depth of flavour
to savoury and sweet dishes.
First off use a pan with a long handle, now
get your food real hot.
Do not flambe over the stove nor under your
kitchen hood.
Never place your head or any part of your
body over the pan and always be prepared for
the blaze.
Use a small amount or alcohol and pour it
from a container, never directly from the
bottle.
Always ignite with long match sticks or with
a long reach lighter.
Flambe burns off the alcohol but leaves great
flavour from the liquid.
Normally, let the flames go out by themselves
but if the flambe gets out of hand then simply
place a metal lid on top to stop it..
And that is how to flambe safely.
