okay guys I'm going to make one of these
having heard a ninja star this isn't in
just glare where it's just as great oh
and um you get the paper fold a hot dog
style and do the same thing again and
then you fold it in half this way then
you unfold it and see where the crease
is you fold it like this and then you
get the longer piece and fold it that
way and then you fold it right you fold
the smaller piece actually their same
size but this piece this way and then
you insert it in here so you get this
piece and fold it over that and then you
want to give it little like a point so
it will fit in you do that then you get
this right here and stick it in
that's what she said looking
kindergarten it's going to be okay and
there is your completed ninja square
