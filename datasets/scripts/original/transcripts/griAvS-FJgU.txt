hi again it's lisa from
budgetequestrain.com and today i wanted
to do a review for you
and kind of an overview of a product i
reviewed a while back
it's called a bug pellet
and this is what it is
and you hang it up in your barn tack
room wherever you got flies and stuff
and it's an all-natural
insect repellent this stuff is
incredible
so i've had it for about
three or four months now
and it's lasted a long long time
but it's kind of lost its potency now so
now it's time to replace it
and
i'm going to hang them up and i'll show
you how i hang them up too but this is
what it looks like empty this is what
the old one looks like so we're going to
refill it with the new refills
so it's pretty easy
you just twist it
maybe
twist it and it comes off and it's like
beeswax and there's a bunch of essential
oils in this this is probably this is
like my favorite product i've found
it's all natural and there's no
chemicals nothing like that which is
really great you know especially around
horses so first i'm going to get rid of
the the beeswax thing that was inside of
it
and i just want to show it to you
so it's like beeswax pastels
so you can see that so it's just a bunch
of beeswax with um essential oils on it
so now
we're gonna open this and it's very easy
to open and this just smells so good it
makes my barn smell amazing
this is like i said this is my
most favorites that i have ever
most favorite product i've ever had and
even opening up that up
i can smell it
so
you i mean you can tol it's this stuff
is so cool so all i'm going to do is
kind of mold it
it's got the essential oils all in it i
wish you could smell it because it's
amazing
then we're just going to push it down
into the
holder
and it has i have to be smarter than the
holder it's not hard
but
and then you turn it
and that makes it so you can't
it won't open back up especially when
you're hanging
so we're gonna do the same
with the other one on the refill
packs
it comes two to a container
and the refills are
20 like 19.99
when you buy them singularly they're
about 15 depending on where you get them
but it's kind of fun it's like arts
arts and crafts project so once you get
it you want to make sure you're going to
want to wash your hands
after you do this essential oils are
they're not harmful but
that wouldn't be very fun to eat
anything so you just push it down in
there
and put the lid on it
again i have to be smarter than the
container
turn it
and it's ready to hang
so there are my reinvigorated bug
pallets which are amazing these are this
is the coolest thing i've ever ever
found in regard to insect control
um for my horses so
their barn is
sorely in need of new ones so we're
going to go put them inside and i'll
show you how where i put them and how i
hang them up
so my barn the stall area is 12 by 24 so
i'm using two bug pellets and that works
very very effectively to keep the flies
and the insects down and what i did was
make two little tie rings just with
twine and i tied them up to the rafters
and then you can just slip on the bug
pellets and there you go
i also use these in my garage and they
work fantastic to keep the flies out of
there as well
okay so now it's been about
15 minutes since i put in
the bug pellets and i brought the horses
in and they're eating their dinner
and there's there's still a couple of
flies in here but
it's not as bad
as it was before
before i put the bug pellet in so
i'm super happy
with this product
and how it works
um it's just i've never seen anything
like it
and knowing that it's all natural
and
it smells good and my horses aren't
going to get hurt by it that makes me
super happy so if you have thought about
getting this
product the bug or actually any of them
because they have fly spray they have
applied and tick gel
i mean they're awesome
if you thought about it you should
really try it see what you think and
just give it a go i'm pretty sure you'll
love it thanks so much for watching and
can't wait to see you again goodbye
