I'm going to show you how to paint a
wall by painting a wall you can
completely transform a room and here's
what we'll need to do the
job dust
sheet
paint paint
brushes paint roller and tray
decorator's
tape
filler Step
Leather paint
scraper stain block optional sugar soap
optional clear the room of any
furniture cover anything you can't
remove with a dust sheet also put a dust
sheet on the floor and any other
surfaces paint could Splash on use
decorator's tape to mask off the edge of
light fittings and skirting boards to
protect them from getting splashed with
paint wash the walls with sugar soap and
rinse off with water and a sponge this
will help to give a smoother finish fill
any cracks or holes in the wall with a
suitable filler and then sand down until
smooth before we go ahead and paint this
wall we must put stain block over the
crayon you could end up putting five or
six coats on this crayon to stop
bleeding through the Emulsion so to stop
that I'm going to to use this stain stop
first always remember mask and
goggles if the wall is newly plastered
apply some matte white Emulsion first as
this will soak into the wall before
applying the colored paint using a brush
start painting by cutting in the edges
this means painting where the wall meets
the sealing down the
corners the skirting boards and around
the light fittings
start at the top and work your way
down when you've cut in use a roller to
paint the main surface of the wall start
in the corner of the room and roll from
the bottom up in smooth steady Strokes
always make sure your roller is well
covered in paint paint one wall at a
time and work your way around the room
leave paint to dry overnight and apply
the second coat if necessary when paint
is completely dry remove strips of
decorator's tape take off the strips
slowly to avoid chipping the
paint and that's how you paint an
interior wall and I think you agree a
complete transformation on the room so
