hi my name is Tony from real man
green.com and today I'm going to show
you guys how to make a tabuli salad with
barley and it's an easy fresh kind of
salad that's um quick to make and easy
to take outside because you should be
eating outside Barley's a really nice
grain that's nice and chewy once you
cook it
up yeah so I got some boiling salted
water here going to dump it in
there and give it a stir and I'm going
to give it going to cook it for about
about 25 to 30 minutes until it's nice
and fluffy and chewy just make sure you
put it on low so it doesn't boil over
we're going to need a whole lemon we'll
need some fresh parsley here some nice
fresh mint and two cloves of garlic
we'll also need
some olive oil EXT verion olive oil
we're going to juice the lemon first see
A nice bright yellow lemon there in
order to really get the juices going
just roll it on the table
on the counter kind of Squish it a
little
bit there you
go that makes for a nice and juicy lemon
I also heard you can put it in the
microwave but that's kind of weird so I
don't do
that so we going to juice the whole
lemon sure you catch the
seeds
go should those
seeds to that I'm going to add two
cloves of garlic all you want to do is
just give them a smash we're going to
take them out
so about 1/4 cup
of extra virgin olive oil in there
ni
stir there you go so that's just lemon
juice and olive oil and you're going to
plop the smashed garlic in there just
going to let it
sit while The Barley
Cooks so this is um pearl barley I use
pearl barley cuz it takes a lot less
time to cook if you get um um Regular
pot pot barley that works too but it
just takes a bit
longer so our barley has been simmering
for about half an hour so we're going to
go check on it see if it's
ready
so should be nice and fluffy here and
about doubled in
size you can just take test it to make
sure should be nice and chewy so this
one's ready so we're going to drain and
rinse the
barley
there give a good
rinse give it some good time to drain
there turn all the water just let it sit
there for a few minutes we're going to
check on our dressing here going to get
rid of the garlic unless you really
like fresh RW garlic in there I don't
prefer you to not smell
it's been sitting in there for about
half an hour while The Barley was
cooking just to infuse some garlicky
Flavor now we need about half a cup of
fresh mint leaves and half a cup of nice
parsley so I've
got nice mint
here that should be good
some fresh
parsley I'm going to squish it into a
nice bundle
and chop it
up all right we're ready to put it
together got a big bowl here
the bar
barley and pour in our
dressing this is good
for we're going to toss in our fresh
herbs just going to add some nice peas
in there too but that's totally
optional so we put our dressing in there
