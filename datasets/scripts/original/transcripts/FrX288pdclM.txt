hi i'm shawn doherty welcome to the home
bartender i got a great joke for you
there's this pirate he walks into a bar
and he orders a drink and the bartender
looks down and says you know you got a
steering wheel stuck down in front of
your pants there and he goes i i know
when it's driving me nuts
well you've probably heard of a fuzzy
navel and a hairy navel both made of
vodka i'm going to introduce you
something that's made with spiced rum
has the same concept i'm going to
introduce you to the fuzzy pirates
what we need for this is the main
ingredient which is a spiced rum
we have
peach schnapps orange curso and orange
juice and we're going to build it in a
high ball glass filled with dice by
first pouring in an ounce of
spiced rum
come on there you go
half ounce
of
peach schnapps
just a splash
a little more of orange carousel
and
top off with orange juice
stir it up a little bit
and there you have
the fuzzy pirates
