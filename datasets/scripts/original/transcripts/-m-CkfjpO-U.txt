Hello dear Friends of the folded sheet
it's me Tavin from TavinsOrigami
today we'll fold a siple Rose from a thin napkin
it's really easy to do
let's get right at it
you can use any thin,cheap napkin
for example I use some from this tissue-box
Also what you'll find at a restaurant will work just fine
fold in about 1/8, two thumbs
two fingers basically wide
use your middlefinger and pointer
as tweazers
hold it together and wrap it around
so you get a cylindrical shape
nice and tight
pick the middle of the napking
and twearl it around
the point is about where the edge of the napkin was
and you continue to twist in the stem of the rose
so the blossom is about as wide
as the stem
take the bottom corner of the napkin
this corner
and seperate ist a little
and make it into a leaf
and then you cna twirl the rest down too
if you started twirling away from yourself you have to continue in the same direction
I, in my case, twirled towards myself
and thus continue to do so
it's a perfect gift
just spontantiously
for a nice person
or on valentine's day for your date
really easy to do and makes a great first impression
that could be it
you could use it now, but we give it a little twist here
twirl it and push it in in the middle
and now for the final finish
take the edge of the outside layer
and bend it around
I'm trying to do it onehanded, so you can see better
but it will be a lot easier if you let go of the stem
and just use both hands
but you can see where I'm going with this
it gives this nice petal shape
which makes it much more lifelike, I think
but you don't need to do it, after all it's your rose
that's it we're done
arainging the lieaves the petals
ready to be given away
and to amaze or woo someone
I hope you enjoyed this and there is more to fold
for example the napkin lotus
or the winged heart by francis ow
both models ar suitable for beginners
