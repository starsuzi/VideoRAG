okay uh as you guys probably most of you
know I am from the
south and in the South one of the things
that we like to eat on New Year's Day to
supposedly bring good luck is blackeyed
peas and so that's what I'm going to
make today I have one pound of dried
blackeyed peas it's one lb bag I've just
been soaking them for a little bit and
these have been soaking for about 2
hours there's really no need to soak
them overnight or anything like that it
only takes 45 minutes to an hour to cook
them anyway so soaking them saves you a
few minutes but it's it's not that big a
deal and I've got some onion this is a
small onion I've diced up and I got a
can of Rotel kind of got crushed in the
opening we're not going to talk about
that too much and here I have some hog
jow this is basically the meat from
around the mouth it's called like hog
hog Jou bacon it actually tastes very
similar to bacon if you don't want to
use this or don't have it can't find it
whatever just use some bacon bacon is
quite often used now what I'm doing here
is this is a big fatty piece I'm going
to take this I'm going to score it a
little bit and I'm going to put this in
the
pan and let it render out some of the
fat take to cut that meat off but the
but the as far as but I'm not going to
leave this in there I'm just going to
render out some of the fat from
it now we're going to take the rest of
this hog gou we're going to dice it
up by the way this is really good for
breakfast and in a substitution for
baking it works really
good if you don't eat pork you can use
anything else you can use like a smoked
turkey neet or something like that just
something to give you some Smoky flavor
that's all we're looking for
here
[Music]
anyway by the way this hog gel works
really good in your crawfish traps it's
hard for the Crawfish to pull it off
it's it's a lot sturdier than
bacon anyway I'll be back with you in a
minute
okay most of the fats rendered off of
this not quite all of it but it's enough
to get us
going pull this
out put that
aside and we're going to take and put
the rest of this meat in
here then we're going to
take we're going to add about half of
our onion cuz the other half we we'll
use as a garnish some people like to put
raw onion right on top of
[Music]
it yeah we're going to Brown this other
meat up and cook these onions down a
little
bit okay as you can see our onions have
kind of softened and we're and our
meat's Browning up a little bit we're
going to go ahead and we're going to
dump in our can of rotail
we're going to add in half a tablespoon
of
salt I'm using sea
salt we put in a little bit of black
pepper not a whole lot
give this in
mix we'll put our blackee peas in
here give this a
stir then what we'll do is at about 40
minutes we're going to bring this back
up to a boil reduce Bo the heat let it
simmer and then I'm going to need to add
a little more water in here too but uh
at about 40 minutes I'll give it a taste
test and we'll see if it needs any more
salt or more Pepper or anything like
that but we'll just keep adding water to
it just to keep our our peas covered up
anyway I'll be back in a little
bit okay we're about 40 minutes into the
cooking now see how we're doing
all right those are good I don't need
any salt or any Pepper or anything like
that but they're still not quite cooked
so we're going to put a little more
water in here to make sure they don't
dry out and we'll let them keep cooking
till they're
tender okay so these have been cooking
for almost an hour
now and they're looking good smelling
good let's see let's see if they've
gotten tender
yeah good yes and they are tender
they're just tender they're not
mush let's go ahead and serve some of
these
up some of that juice
[Music]
going put some onion on
there we're going to put a little bit of
hot sauce on
there and then that's how we're how I'm
going to eat them
