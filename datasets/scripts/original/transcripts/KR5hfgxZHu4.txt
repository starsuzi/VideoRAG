[Music]
o good
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
for good for me
[Music]
well I just got to a
spot this is a new spot and there's
absolutely no one here and I heard that
it is stacked with trout and little
smallmouth bass so where I'm going to go
is I'm going to go over there because
it's probably a deeper pocket but I'm
just checking this out over
here I really wish someone would have
been able to come with me today because
I always hate coming out to the
mountains alone it's not very safe but I
was pretty eager to come fish so I guess
this is just the stubborn side of me uh
just coming to fish but if you guys ever
want to Go Fish and are thinking about
going to an isolated area that you're
not comfortable with uh I don't
recommend it to go by yourself it's not
a good
idea make sure you're always bringing a
buddy with you or someone because if
you're out here in the middle of nowhere
like I'm in this year in Nevada's right
now if you're out in the middle of
nowhere I mean who's going to help you I
I'm pretty sure I don't have service and
so
yeah always make sure you bring a buddy
just checking this out it's just a
little
creek the creek doesn't look like it'll
have much in it so I don't see anything
from up here so I'm going to walk down
with my poles and I'm going to go over
there so this is okay this is like my
all-time uh favorite type of fish
hold on I'm going to talk once I
get so this is my favorite type of
fishing absolute favorite
there's really nothing that beats
it venturing
through the
Wilderness and just looking at all the
SES that there are and just enjoying
what Nature has to offer
so I've got one pole over there sitting
with like power bait or something but I
hate fishing for trout like that so over
here I've got my little teaser
tube and I'm just going to jig for some
trout over here there's been a few
blowups around
here and um seem like pretty decent
sized fish
jeez there's a fish there's a
fish oh and it's not a trout it's a
small
mouth what are the
odds he came up and got it right from
the
shore no trout but a small mouth look at
that little
guy hang on buddy hang on
I'll let you go get out of
here I'm not surprised that there's
Smallmouth like stacked up on here it's
just nothing but Rock and just deep
little
Cove I'm going to cast right over
here not too stressed about that Rod
right now now not even one bite on
it Oh I thought I was snagged but it's a
fish it's a nice small mouth they've got
some crazy colors on them out here it's
a little little tiny small mouth there
he
goes he's just hanging out by that tree
stump I thought I was snagged and that
was
weird there's a fish it's a little small
mouth come here buddy
came out of nowhere I saw him take it
too Smallmouth
are really beautiful it's just they're
not big they're not the size that I
want he came like right between that
rock and just like destroyed this little
tube even though this tube I'm
technically using it for
trout see you that every
buddy off he goes
I really wish I was on the other side
but right here nothing but Rocky points
this is Smallmouth SL trout like
territory I know trout love the rocks
and same with Smallmouth and these are
like deep deep little pockets
too and the reason why I want to go on
the other side so bad is because they're
surfacing all along the shade over there
so I may walk down a bit and see if I
could find a
oh man there was a hit I may walk down a
bit and see if I could find a place to
cross but not paying attention right
when I'm talking there's a hit oh
well it's time to make a move
across I've noticed that a lot of the
fish over there is surfacing along the
shadows and when I first got here I was
so eager to
fish I didn't bother finding a way to
get over to the other
side
and honestly if I walk down
more I could probably find a way to get
to the other
side because the other side looks a lot
more
promising so I've found a way across
feet are going to get tiny bit wet I
feel like my biggest challenge is going
to be getting back up though
okay
yeah it's pretty
cold it's actually not as bad as that
Don Pedro Place but it's still pretty
cold all right
what gets better than this look I'm
walking I almost slipped I'm walking
through the
mountains trying to find spots spots
that maybe no one else has ever fished
before like maybe this is the first time
anyone's ever
fishing look at
that and basically it doesn't get any
better than that
it's just it's just beautiful even if
you're not catching anything up here in
the mountains it doesn't
matter you can't see anything like this
at a
pond or I mean it's just it's unreal to
me to come and see sites like this it's
my absolute favorite
so when you're fishing water like this
you want it you want it to catch the
current basically and then once it
catches the current well this current is
pretty weak
you just want to let your bait drift
down as far as it could
go just keep letting it drift all the
way
Downstream it'll catch any fish's
attention and then once you're ready
just start jigging it back and usually
on your way
back that's when you'll feel a
fish well I successfully made it to the
other side and wow there's like this
super super deep pocket right here that
I'm going to fish it looks so nice may
just be filled with small
mouth or there may be some trout in here
too oh there's a small
mouth can't get too close to
him small mouth right in front of me
got
him little baby small
Mouse I'm honestly surprised I haven't
even got one bite not even one bite on
the power bait I have it's like a garlic
scent I even threw the salmon
eggs every time I'm reeling in it's just
still there
yeah it's a nice
trout it's a decent trout oh it's a
decent
trout it's a it's a decent trout
yeah right here in this pocket right
here oh can't stand
straight this is probably like 3 lbs I
don't have my scale on
me oh my it's a new
PP for
spe
baby little tra
[Music]
and if you're an angler and you see a
Shore angler and you're on a boat like
don't snake that guy and if his fish
goes floating off get it for him don't
tell him to jump in I don't know I'm
going to do the catch and cook at home
so I'm going to go home I'm going to
show you guys how to prepare the fish
I'm going to show you how to gut it I'm
going to show you to clean it and then
most importantly I'm going to show you
the best ingredients to put to make this
fish taste good so I will catch you guys
when I get
home step
one get the grill
going I have this
little electric grill going on so I just
put it on the highest setting and by the
time this is done it'll be down to about
450 maybe even 500Â° maybe 475 is so turn
that on
step two get your cutting boards or
whatever you want to cut the fish
on and get a sharp knife there's also
knives that they sell at Walmart the
Rapala um they knives made for filling
and they're like 10 15 bucks you get
that for few
times and that'll work fine now we are
going to take take this knife and we're
going to start cleaning the fish going
in upward motion to get all that FL
off you don't want
that so you got one side done now you're
going to do this side you don't want any
of that nasty FL on your fish now the
skin is going to be peeled off either
way when you take them off the grill the
skin is going to peel right off but I'm
super picky and you don't want any of
that F on there like as it is I do not
like to eat the fish I catch I like to
release them but under the
circumstances this fish died he
swallowed my hook and and he had another
hook lodged in his throat now I was able
to get him out and there was no bleeding
but when I was trying to release him I
tried to release him for like a good 10
minutes and he just wasn't swimming off
there was no blood there was no guts
that I pulled out it was just I don't
know he just didn't want to go off trout
are super sensitive and they actually
die pretty easy and I really really
really wanted to throw this guy back
just because he's a he's a nice trout I
wanted him to get bigger but it is what
it is and I know a lot of people ask for
catching cooks and I usually see that on
top comments of other videos like catch
and cook catch and cook so this is the
catch and cook going to want to do next
let's go and make the
incision and I do need a better
knife I would recommend that rapalo one
from Walmart it's pretty inexpensive for
a fillet
knife and just make the
incision all the way up till you hit
right about
there right
there and right here right behind his
head you're going to cut diagonal
okay okay and once the head is like that
stick your finger in you grab all the
inerts and they'll come out just like so
you can toss them do whatever you want
to do with the
inerts I throw them
away so now all you're left with is this
and looks like we just murdered someone
now get our hands a little
clean so you do not want that blood line
in there so what you're going to do is
you're going to take your
thumb and you're going to go ahead and
push all of that gunk out you want that
out
weird not good
and once you have that bloodline clean
it should look something like this it
should look nice and clean there
shouldn't be any dark spots in there you
do not want that in there when you're
cooking this fish
once you've removed the
fins this is what the fish should look
like
so got a nice little slab right there as
we can
see and now all that's left is to season
this bad boy next thing we're going to
do is go ahead and place some foil down
and add some seasonings I have some
garlic powder and some lemon pepper and
I also have some butter if I had lemons
I would also put lemon wedges in between
after I season the fish but I just go
ahead and I open the guy
up and I just
start seasoning it with some lemon
pepper just adding some lemon
pepper try and get in between
there also if any of you guys know why
this trout meat is pink let me know in
the comment section below because I've
all the trout I've caught and and I've
kept the meat has been white I've only
seen pink meat if it's a COC Andy salmon
and this trout for whatever reason has
pink
meat which is unusual for me so if you
know go and leave a comment in the
comment section
below take some of that take some of
this
just go ahead and rub it
in rub it
in so now we're just going to go ahead
and wrap this guy
up like so
go and wrap them
[Music]
up here nice and
compact now we're going to go ahead and
take them out here the grill should be
already
ready and I'm going to go ahead and set
my time timer
to I'm going to do 23 minutes so go
ahead set your guy on there like
that go and get the timer
going so this gu is probably done let's
go and check on them real
quick see how it
looks oh and it looks like it's done
look at that skin right
there the
[Music]
camera looks like he's done the only
thing left to do is to go ahead and just
peel that skin off just peel it
back and if you cooked it long enough
it's going to just peel right
off
yep he's ready
ohon I don't know if fish or fish
because this fish is
Pink as I was saying if anyone knows why
this fish is pink let me know but okay
that is a good
fish and this is the amount of meat I
got out of that
trout let's dig
in I'll let you guys know how it tastes
let's see here let's get a
[Music]
bite for those of you who are not aware
normal trout is white and it's typically
very very Bland and that's why I don't
eat trout but this
this is
amazing so
good well you guys that's going to
conclude today's video The Catch and
cook on the menu was this hybrid rainbow
trout I guess I'll call
it and if you guys like today's video
I'll be making some more catch and cooks
for you guys but stay tuned and I hope
you enjoyed this video until next time
