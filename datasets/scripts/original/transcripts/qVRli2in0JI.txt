Rev up your engines,
today I'm going to talk about why not to use
an automatic car wash,
now the first sort of automatic car wash was
in 1914 in Detroit where they called it,
automated laundry for cars,
and really it was basically three guys that
pushed the car through,
one guy soaped it up, one guy rinsed it, and
the other guy drove it,
so it was basically just three guys and washing
you car,
but then things really changed,
the Anderson family out of Seattle invented
a totally automated car wash where the car
was pulled through with a machine and washed
mechanically,
now to begin with,
washing your car isn't like washing yourself,
you want to exfoliate yourself with the brush
to get the dead skin cells off,
but when your washing a car, you don't want
to take anything off,
you don't want to take the wax off,
you don't want to rub the paint off,
so using brushes isn't such a hot idea,
you don't want these brushes wiping fast hitting
your car's paint,
because it doesn't matter if they clean them
once in a while,
these brushes get covered with dirt, dirt
is friction, the little pieces of dirt is
like sand paper, they're going to put micro
scratches on your paint,
and just to play the devil's advocate,
even if they cleaned them, which the rarely
do,
the car in front of you is covered in dirt,
these brushes are cleaning it off,
a lot of that dirt is going to be on the brushes,
so when it comes to your car,
there's all that dirt that's now all being
hit against your car,
they would have to clean it every time,
which they certainly don't,
and for deep cleaning on those automatic car
washes,
a lot of them use hydrofluoric acid,
you don't want acid being sprayed on your
car,
of course that's going to eat up the paint
and stuff,
and to add insult to injury,
your often going to end up with water spots
on the car,
yeah they have those blowers that blow your
car as they go through at the end,
but they don't take all the water off,
heck look at this,
there's water all over the place on one I
just ran through,
they really don't dry it all that well,
plus when do you get your car washed,
when it's sunny outside, you don't get your
car washed when it's raining,
so since it's sunny outside, you go out the
sun is going to beat down on these water spots,
and they're going to bake them into your paint,
they can be a real hassle to get out,
and I know some people are going to say, Scotty
what about those car washes where it's an
automatic car wash and at the end they got
guys that are drying it by hand,
well you have to beware of that too in most
cases,
because they're washing all kinds of cars
there and then drying them,
you think those towels are going to be clean
for very long,
and you see the guys are dropping them on
the ground, dirt is on them and they pick
them up and dry the car,
you know it doesn't do such a good job when
you do something one, after the other, after
the other using the same equipment,
I just my own bucket, and my own clean wool
mitt,
and my own clean microfiber towels to dry
it,
and guess what, I only do one car at a time,
then I'll just wash that stuff in the washing
machine later when I was my work clothes,
so the next time I do it, all the stuff is
clean and it works good,
and if you want actual proof of the problem
of automatic car washes,
here's my old Celica that I bought from a
customer years ago, she went through automatic
car washes all the time,
look how faded the paint is,
and here's my wife's Lexus that I bought used
from a customer who never used an automatic
car wash and always hand washed them,
look how shinny it still is,
so if you want your car's paint to last a
long time, and always look shiny,
stay away from automatic car washes,
and really look at the sloppy job this one
did,
there's still dirt all over those place,
so much for the cleaner and blower,
it did a horrible job,
so if you never want to miss another one of
my new car repair videos, remember to ring
that bell!
