hey it's Clen and Courtney and
[Music]
we the
[Music]
K so our idea for this video actually
came while we were doing another recipe
Alton Browns walk fried peanut butter
which was super yummy but after we had
fried up the the peanuts and they were
cooling on some paper towels what
happened bunch of them and how' they
taste really good really yummy so we
thought why not try that with almonds
and we did and just uh sprinkled a
little bit of salt on them and they were
just crazy delicious way better than
anything you get from the snack
aisle our idea for this version we
decided we would uh take the leftover
oil from our other video The Garlic
chips and tips video tip tips and chips
tips and chips tips and chips so we
still have about a tablespoon of now
garlic infused oil in our pan what temp
do we need to take that up to remember
from the video oh we need to take it up
to medium high heat all right let's do
that for every tablespoon of oil you use
you need a pound of nuts you know your
oil is ready when it starts to Shimmer
so then we add our
nuts stir your nuts for about a minute
minut then you take the heat down to
[Music]
medium you don't need to stir constantly
though you should give it a good stir
every minute or so we've been going now
for five or 6
minutes and while the color hasn't
changed a whole bunch on the almonds
they are actually starting to look a
little bit thicker or puffier
and soon we'll start hearing little
cracks or pops come from
them it has now been 10 minutes we' got
a couple nuts here looking darker than
the others just going to give them a
little bit more of a
stir
and then we're going to dump them out
onto a cookie sheet line with paper
[Music]
towels spread them
out as close as you can to a single
layer while they're still hot we'll
sprinkle them with kosher sauce
salt they have cooled they have been
liberally
[Music]
salted wow I mean like compared
seriously compared to canned nuts not
going to name any company names but
there's a big
one these are is so much
better I mean
it it's got that sort of nut butter
taste to
it I really don't taste the garlic from
the oil at all so I think it's totally
safe if you just want to use peanut oil
when you're doing these but man oh
man really good
yeah
