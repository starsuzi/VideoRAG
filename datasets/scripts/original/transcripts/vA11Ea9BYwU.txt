hello fellow YouTubers bear prepper here
today we're going to do some Stevia so
this is my stevia from my garden
harvested
yesterday and supposedly you can taste a
leaf and it'll be
sweet oh my goodness that's really
really
sweet wow okay I did not expect that
well we're GNA make some stevia extract
and we're gonna make some powdered
Stevia and hopefully I can show you how
to use it that's really
sweet first thing you want to do is wash
off your
[Music]
Stevia at this point
you want to pull the leaves off and most
of the videos I've
seen to be
honest let me show you down
here I just don't think they know how to
do it they're going one leaf by one leaf
by one leaf hold the
tip pull your fingers down it strip it
and pop the tip off and keep the tip
okay so don't pick it off Leaf by leaf
hold the tip whoops and sometimes it
breaks but you
know pull them
down very
simple they are really
sweet save the tip apparently the tip
has the most sugar in it and while
you're growing it a lesson I learned is
the minute you see flowers
deadheaded matter of fact you can take
it down within um um 6 in of the
dirt because once it starts flowering
it'll actually kill the
plant so unfortunately I'll probably
lose that plant that's flowering out at
the retreat but that's all you do you
don't want the stems yes the stems have
Stevia in it but it's so minute and
they're bitter that you just don't want
them okay so let me go ahead and uh get
this done and then all we're going to do
with this we're going to make some
extract to
start okay after 2 days you want to pour
your Stevia into a fine mesh strainer or
use Che cheesecloth and you don't want
to push too much but my uh
Stevia is and I'm holding my camera cuz
my other camera's broken and you want to
push all that nice juice
out
okay and now you want to cook this over
low heat do not let it boil or it'll get
really
bitter so we're going to cook it over
low heat for 30
minutes now there warned this would
happen do you see the sediment now it
actually clumps anything that makes it
through the strainer will Clump and then
we'll strain that out again pretty
trippy
huh all right it's got uh another uh 20
minutes okay this is going to be fun
trying to film this holding the camera
cuz this camera won't go on the tripod
all right so I'm going to try to hold
told you with my finger
there I've got some uh um flower sock
towels and uh made a well I'm going to
do the final strain the reason you're
cooking it for 30 minutes is to get the
alcohol out and I pray I get it into the
jar and you're just going to pour it
in let it strain
through and that's all those specks that
we saw
collecting and there we
go we now have stevia
extract so I'm going to take a
spoon and I'm going to taste
it it's warm
now but I'm not going to put much on my
spoon see
that
maybe little less than half a teaspoon I
would
say I would say there's still alcohol in
it definitely still alcohol I'm going to
cook it some
more no definitely don't like the
alcohol
wishka let's cook it
again maybe I just didn't simmer it hot
enough
okay borrowing the camera see if we can
give you the after results on this this
is the stevia
powder it's green I've got about 2
tablespoons which is one cup now when I
finished grinding the stevia in the
coffee
grinder I uh took and added some water
to
it and that is really uh a half a
teaspoon is probably about a teaspoon of
sugar and that's just the powder added
to some water from the coffee
grinder really very good I really like
it this is the stevia needs to be
filtered again that I did with the
alcohol I don't like it I don't like it
at all it's bitter it tastes heated um
this is wonderful it stores I mean it's
a powder you can just store it you can
mix up your stevia whenever you want
with water and you don't have to waste
your alcohol so what I'm going to try to
do since I get a camera I can use all
the time I'm going to try to create a
recipe with the powdered Stevia probably
need a little more um I could probably
make a small cake or or a zucchini bread
or something with uh two tablespoons so
got to keep in mind I only have one cup
of sugar here and see how it does I'm
going to use this and coffee and things
like that and see how much it actually
takes to sweeten it very very slightly
um I probably use a teaspoon and a half
of that sweet cream that you get like
the vanilla cream in my coffee and we'll
see how much it takes to get that kind
of flavor and this stuff I'm probably
just going to throw it out I really
really don't like it so you know for
those of you that like it this way go
for it I'm going to stick with the easy
way
