hi once again this is tipin Mendoza I
would like to present one of the famous
dessert
in my country it's called turun
turun is consists of banana
sweet yellow banana and it's wrapped
over
uh spring roll
egg roll wrapper
spring roll shell is egg roll wrapper
this time I would like to present to you
how to make
the best way to make Turon
of course we have to use the banana
take off both sides cut it into half
with the skin always cut the banana with
the skin because sometimes
the banana is hard to
to cut without skin because it will just
slant into your knife
so cut it into like four
pieces
of
banana with skin
then
beat off
put aside
the
the skin of the banana before I proceed
I almost forget to introduce to you
my ingredients
the only thing that we have here
is the banana
the jackfruits as you could see
this type of fruits you could always buy
it in any Asian store
that sells the egg roll wrapper
this is the egg roll wrapper
the square egg roll wrapper this is uh
this is the ideal for turun
as you see you tow it and it could be
peeled easily separate easily one pocket
I think consists of like 25 pieces
easy easy to hold it's easy to handle
and you just have to separate it
this jackfruit
also
is is a you could buy it in Asian
it's look this way here this type of
fruits but
in any way you could always substitute
this with some other
jelly or marmalade grapes jelly or guava
jelly or anything sweet that you wish if
you can find any jackfruit first you
have I have just read it like slice it
in the into small
pieces so that it will fit their the
banana when I wrap it
first things you have to do is
pick up one of the piece of of egg egg
roll wrapper
put the banana here lay it down nice
flat and then
you could
put the
jackfruits
also
to make it flat you could use one of the
dish
and
silks I fold it
by
first folding is
fold it in by the square one of the
corner of the square
this way
then to sealed it you could use water
the silk
the cell the egg egg roll wrapper again
I will demonstrate
another one
banana
jackfruits or any jelly that you want
the taste grapes marmalade
well it in the other Corner then right
corner then left corner then roll it
over
and then sealed it with water
now you get two
and another one
with the jackfruits here
roll it in the first corners
hold it in the left corner and then the
right corner
seal it with water
roll it over
and then you have another one here
this egg this Turon
we have to fry it
you don't bake it
it's it's it's frying
it's uh it's very simple
you just have to fry it
evenly and then so that uh
the the inside banana and the Jackfruit
will be heated and it will be cooked
now I think we could fry it now
foreign
it's not really very hot but it has to
worm as hot as possible not boiling not
boiling okay
regular oil any type of oil
then you dip the banana
with the finished product you dip it
it's it's uh
it's not too
much hot but
this could also cook
little by little
this the cooking will
will take us like maybe
three minutes
and then when you see it's
already getting brownies
move it a little bit so that it will not
uh if it will not stick to its other
but anyway this egg roll wrapper
will not stick
as I said before inside if you don't if
you cannot get a jackfruits
you could substitute it with any
jelly or marmalade grapes or orange
marmalade that you wish or mango
marmalade you could substitute it with a
The Taste is sweet
and also if you cannot get any anything
you could also
uh
use sugar if you wish but I would say I
would use like some kind of jelly
especially Jackfruit as I show it in the
can so you you have an idea
what uh what what to look look what to
look for and you have an idea where to
look at always in the Asian is there any
Asian store will will have it
as you could see it's turning brown so
you could Flip It Up
at the other side
flip it in the other side
see it it doesn't break it never never
breaks
the uh
the wrapper is so strong that it will
not break at all
so this is how to make turoni
to improve it maybe you could just
modify yourself whatever you want to put
it inside
as you could see
this is what we have
now
and
see it's it's kind of crispy
outside
and if you
if you slice it
see did you hear that it's it's very
very crispy and you could see
banana is cooked and and the Jackfruit
also is is cooked inside the banana this
will blend
you could serve it a whole like this
see how how crispy is it
or you could
you could cut it but I would say serve
it like this
