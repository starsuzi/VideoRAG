i'm ben harrison here at irvine art
music center in irvine california
welcome to basic flute maintenance for
the beginning flute player
i have here in front of me the yamaha
flute maintenance kit
that we sell and one of our rental
yamaha flutes
today i'm going to go through the basic
things that should be done after every
playing
or maybe after a certain amount of time
of playing just to make sure that your
flute will continue to stay
in good working condition the most
important
thing that we're going to go over first
is the flute rod
this is what cleans and swabs out the
inside of the instrument this should be
done
every single time after playing without
that you'll end up with a dirty flute
sticky pads corrosion rust lots of bad
stuff
in the yamaha flute maintenance kit you
have a white
polishing gauze you'll take that and
string it
through the hole in the cleaning rod
and swab the flute out again after every
time
just by sticking it into the end
and once you get about halfway pull back
and go in the other direction
you can cut this cloth in half that way
you'll have two
when going through the head joint you
only push
until it stops if you push past that
point
then you will you'll do the
exact same thing as you would with the
main body but
only push until you feel it stop if you
push further than that your flute will
stop playing in tune so pull the swab
out
and then onto the foot joint
and then you're all done and that should
be done every single time after playing
the instrument the other swabs that are
in
the other cloths that are in the
maintenance kit
are a basic polish cloth just to wipe
fingerprints or anything off of the
instrument
this one you can use for any purpose
it's just a basic
microfiber cloth and then we have a
silver polishing cloth
this one because this flute is silver
plated will work really really well to
take the fingerprints and
the tarnish off of the flute make it
shine like it's new
and lastly they have cleaning paper
which you take one little piece when a
pad is sticking
place it in the tone hole
and just push lightly that will soak up
the moisture and make the pad stop
sticking
that's everything for the basic
maintenance you can read through the
manual that comes
in the maintenance kit or stop by your
local technician
and they can instruct you the same way
if there's anything
other than that dents scratches air
leaks
bring it to a qualified technician to
flute should be into a technician
once every six to eight months either
way everything like that should be done
every day
thank you for watching it's bending me
