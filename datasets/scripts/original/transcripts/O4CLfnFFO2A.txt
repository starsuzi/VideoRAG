I hope you've seen my part one video on
caring for the cloth of a snooker
table uh moving on from that let's show
you and talk about how to clean the
table
correctly the first thing
is I like to mention is try to move the
balls away take them out of the out of
the rail and put them into the tray or
into the box or whatever so you're not
putting dust onto the
balls seems a pointless thing to do
start at the BK end of the
table and on this it's never quite sure
which way the nap's going to run on the
B and at the black end okay on the side
it all on the rails always runs with the
direction of the nap going that way but
here it's not always the case so just
have a feel some way it'll feel coarse
another way smooth so brush in the
direction of the nap that's the first
thing then get underneath the cushion
rail just make sure all the dust goes
away then start with the side cushion
and here we go again just making sure
that we're going with the that all the
time and then this
one there we go so now we can start on
the main bed of the
table couple of points here the first
one that infuriates me actually a lot of
youngsters get the privilege of free
table
time on the condition that they brush
and clean the tables
well when it's happening in a club
there's a lot of dust flying around
they're never really shown how to do
these things properly and they tend to
flick the brush and the dust just goes
up and then it's going to settle back
down onto the cloth rather silly thing
to do but equally these youngsters there
still going to be a lot of dust around
and owners and parents indeed should
insist they wear a mask they should not
be breathing this dust in it's bad for
them so please when you doing a lot of
tables or in Dusty environment make sure
you wear a mask keep the brush in
contact with the bed all the time so
here we go again all the time fair
amount of
pressure going with the nap of the cloth
and the the brush never leaves the table
that way you keep the
dust down on the table as you brush it
along
I'm not flicking the brush up into the
air and we do both sides of the table
the
same doesn't take very long it's worth
doing
properly and then the second operation
is to nap the cloth so here what I've
done is got a piece of snooker cloth
staple to the back end of the
brush be careful when you put these
staples in we don't want any showing on
the surface here so it's all done on the
on the edges of the brush so there's no
sharp edges to cut the cloth as you nap
it we turn it over or just fair amount
of pressure and just nap the cloth let
make sure that the nap is untangled and
laying
correctly all in the same direction
good polish it to
have and there we
go the last thing is to iron the table
now these things generally have a
thermostat on so the heat is controlled
it can't get too hot some of the older
older versions don't have a thermostat
so just be careful you can burn the
cloth if there's any doubt place it on a
piece of paper if it burns the paper it
will certainly burn the cloth be
careful when you moving the iron along
don't keep it Square cuz you'll create
tram lines a good idea just to put it at
a slight angle like that so the two
edges are not all in unison there so we
go there there turn it at a slight angle
no need for a lot of
pressure and there we go as you come
into the the middle pocket here be
careful here the point of the iron I
have seen it tear the cloth in this this
area here so just be a little bit
careful as you're going
along
okay notice it on slight angle with the
iron all the
time that way we don't create any undo
tram lines on the
cloth finally what I do I've got a
little sponge and from there I'll just
polish the wood up a little bit just a
little bit of moisture on there not to
get it on the cloth just a damp sponge
just to keep the wood work nice and
clean one of the things that tends to
and what tends to score these Woods
believe it or not is these things belt
bottles as you're playing a shop they
tend to scratch the woodwork be a little
bit careful with
it nice clean table to play on and
actually when it's done properly it's an
absolute pleasure to play on
[Music]
and it's always a good idea to invest in
a suitable cover to protect what in
effect is a very valuable piece of
equipment
