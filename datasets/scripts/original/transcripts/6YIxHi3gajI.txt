greetings gastronauts this is Keith
Cooks I'm Keith and today I'm going to
show you a splendid summer salad Juna
[Music]
salad so it's the middle of July here in
Spain we've been having a heat wave for
about the
last it seems like a century but
probably a week or so uh and the last
thing you want to do is have hot food so
I've been living on salads and
they don't have to be boring if you pay
a bit of attention and put some nice
stuff in there uh you can actually end
up looking forward to having your
salad so there we go tuna salad easy
peasy and delicious so the ingredients
for this are fairly loose you've got to
have lettuce obviously you got to have
boiled eggs and you got to have tuna and
you got to have vinegret so the lettuce
this is um a little Roma lettuce and
this is a pile of Lamb's lettuce
I've got a red onion I've got a tomato
I've got a can of really good tuna in uh
kind of fingers and in olive oil I've
also got some Anchovies and teaspoon of
Capers which give a bit of Zing uh these
eggs need to be boiled and this is my
homemade vinegret which is absolutely
wonderful you can also add cucumber
olives things like that if you wish
first things to do is H get the eggs
boiled I so I covered the two eggs in
water brought it to the boil uh taken it
off the heat with a lid on for 10
minutes and that would give us a nice
hardboiled egg you don't want running
yolks in this next thing to do is prep
the lettuce this has got a
Scraggy bit of beer on the bottom and
uh some of the outer leaves a little bit
not so good so I'll pull those off and
then I'll give that a good old rinse
under cold water the Lamb's lettuce uh
again that wants
washing and now we need to dry the
lettuce and the best the best way to do
that is with uh a cheap plastic salad
spinner these are pretty amazing
things now we prepped the other veggie
type things I'm just going to quarter no
I'm going to e this tomato cuz it's
quite
big so the timer just went off the eggs
they've had their 10 minutes so I've put
them into cold water and now I've peeled
the onion I'm going to slice it quite
thinly I'm also going to chop the anies
into little wee
bits right now we're ready to assemble
the salad and we'll start with uh kind
of buttresses of the outer leaves
just cuz it looks pretty and G gives it
a bit of height you also you want a
fairly shallow dish to to make it in
this is actually the bottom half of a
tajine um the rest of
the remain or C lettuce I'm going to
just slice into big
chunks it's so lovely and
crunchy and this this is only for two
people so you know isn't massive
let's pop in the Lamb's
lettuce and the Capers and the anies and
the tomatoes and onions just mix that a
little
bit now we put the dressing
on and this this stuff just makes all
the difference it's uh it really brings
it to life mix it all together I like to
do it with my fingers cuz you get
you know you got everything properly
coated and they make lots of mess and
finally we'll quarter the
eggs just place them
in
artistically and finally
finally the star of the show the tuna
uh need to drain most of the oil off it
and then just break it up into big big
old
chunks and this is why you need to pay a
little bit extra for your your tuna
because um you don't want Flakes and you
certainly don't want mush you want big
identifiable
chunks here we have tuna salad which is
a joy to eat on a hot Summer's Day such
as
this and you know I'm not Mr Salad eater
