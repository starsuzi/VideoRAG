I'm going to show you how to play those
signature dime squeals first of all
you're going to need Floyd Rose or any
floating tremolo
system and you're going to need to know
where and how to
play natural harmonics from the 9th 7th
Fifth Fifth fourth even up to the second
[Music]
okay um first of all what you're going
to want to do
is pluck the G string most like it the G
string is the best string to do these on
so just pluck that with your I use my
middle finger so just try
[Music]
that and at the same time you pluck pull
down on the tremolo
and on the way back up from
this you're going to want to pluck or
not pluck tap right over any natural
harmonic I'm doing the fourth
so so sorry this is really
slow so you pluck and you pull down then
you
tap and then you bring back up
[Music]
so I'm going to add a little Distortion
to
that so I think anyways pluck and pull
[Music]
down and then on the way back up as you
can see my hand in the back
there so right now you're in this
position after you pluck it and then
you're going
to you're going to tap right over the
fourth fret right
here so here we go
so if that didn't help just send me a
message and I'll make a new video
[Music]
