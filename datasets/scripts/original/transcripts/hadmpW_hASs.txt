 There's nothing better than 
 a perfectly cooked cheesecake 
 and what that means is you have 
 to take it out of the oven 
 right at the right time. 
 Sometimes the timing 
 and the temperature of the oven 
 will fluctuate, 
 so I want to show you a little tip 
 that will ensure that your cheesecake
 is cooked just perfectly. 
 Our cheesecake out of the oven. 
 It's been in at 160 degrees 
 for about 50 minutes. 
 So you can see that the cheesecake 
 has that perfect little wobble 
 and you know that it's gonna cool 
 and just be the most sublime texture.
 I want to show you an example of one 
 that's been a little overcooked. 
 So this one you can see 
 there's some caramelisation 
 on the top of the cheesecake 
 which probably indicates it's been 
 cooked at too high a temperature 
 or it was left in the oven 
 for too long. 
 And you can also see these cracks 
 all the way through it. 
 And this cheesecake actually 
 has white chocolate in it 
 which binds it even better. 
 So if it wasn't 
 a white chocolate cheesecake, 
 those cracks would be a lot worse. 
 So now you know how to cook 
 the perfect cheesecake, 
 what's stopping you? Get busy.
