OK. So, our next step in painting the bathroom
is to prime the areas that we've just repaired.
We have everything cleaned up. So, let's get
going. We have our primer here. What I'm going
to do is, is going to use my painter's tool
to pop the lid off. Alright. When you have
primer shaken up at the store it makes it
a lot easier. Just have them give it a little
shake. If not they usually provide you with
a paint stirrer. But, this primer looks like
it's all good; ready to go. So, I'm going
to grab my cup and I'm going to grab my brush.
What I have here is a two inch angled sash
brush. It's good for getting the different
angles on tricky surfaces like this. So, what
I'm going to do is I'm going to pour primer
in. It's just going to be about a third of
a cup. Alright. Now, what I want to do is
I want to clean off the edge there, catch
all the drips. Not a bad idea at this point
to put on some rubber gloves to protect our
hands so we don't get too messy. Alright.
So, what we're going to focus on priming mostly
is the areas that we've removed and we've
exposed the bare surface underneath. Now,
this is wood so this has to be sealed with
the primer. So, what the primer is going to
do is it's going to sink into all the imperfections
and areas that are compromised and chalky.
It's going to be a good go between for a final
coat. So, you can just go right ahead. You're
dipping the brush and then you're getting
the excess paint off of the brush so it's
not dripping. You want to get as much on the
brush as you can and then remove it. You can
either do that by slapping both sides of the
pail or some people like to dip it and then
just kind of knock off that paint so it's
still pretty well loaded up. Be going; just
going around. You don't have to be fussy at
this stage about any type of order that you
go in. Just make sure that you get all of
the areas.
Now, priming is very helpful to the final
coat, because a lot of times if you skip this
step what you're ending up doing is you're
painting over flaking, chalky or greasy surfaces
and the paint is just not going to stick.
It's going to look good at first. It's going
to hold out, maybe, for a little while, but
within the first year it's probably going
to start flaking, and peeling and cracking
once again. We want to lay it pretty much
as heavy as you can get it in there and then
you brush it out. See where everything is
turning nice and white. I like to let the
primer seep right into seams and joints and
cracks and all those areas. Those are the
key areas, because what you're doing is you're
exposing several different types of surface:
chalky, flaking plaster and bare wood. That's
the kind of stuff that you want to always
want to have primed. OK. We're going to continue
right along. Now, this is an area that is
pretty common and problematic for bathrooms.
Around the tub surround and the shower surround
what you get is a lot of moisture from the
tile area meeting where the plaster is. The
paint becomes really compromised, so this
is a good opportunity for us to seal it up
with our primer. That's good. Let me get this
little bit of area that we sanded and that's
it.
