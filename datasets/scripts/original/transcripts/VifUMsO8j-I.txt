test kitchen. Homemade bread cubes make a
big difference in texture and flavor of stuffing.
Here are few secrets to success to make your
own bread cubes for any stuffing recipe. You
won't believe how easy it is. First, cut the
bread into even size cubes. A half inch is
good. You can use practically any type of
bread to make stuffing, but in the test kitchen,
we like the ones that have good flavor and
texture like sour dough or corn bread. A hardy
country style bread is a terrific all-purpose
choice and if you have a couple of different
kinds on hand, feel free to use both. Next,
spread the cubes on the baking sheets and
bake until they are dry, but not brown, stirring
a couple of times during baking. Now, here's
the test kitchen secret. It's really important
to use dry bread so it can absorb all the
flavorful liquid ingredients in the recipe.
You can dry out the bread cubes up to a week
ahead of time and store them in resalable
plastic bags. Just be sure to cool the baked
cubes before storing them. Make all you holiday
celebrations memorable with better homes and
gardens secrets to success.
