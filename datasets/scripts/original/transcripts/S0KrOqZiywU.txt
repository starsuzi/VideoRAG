hi everyone I'm Rachel and today i'm
reviewing clean warm cotton buy clean
clean focuses on fresh clean no-nonsense
scents and this one like the name says
evokes clean warm cotton see notes
dominate the fragrance mixing with
citrus lemon verbena musk fern and other
notes to create a scent that reminds
wearers of clean clothes hung out to dry
in the sour time great for women who
prefer clean scents are for smelling
like flowers spices or heavy mosques
that's all for today remember to follow
fragrance ex on Facebook Instagram and
Twitter and subscribe to our YouTube
channel for more of the same kind of
