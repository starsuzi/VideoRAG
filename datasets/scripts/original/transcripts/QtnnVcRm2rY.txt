hey everyone I'm going to show you guys
how to blow up balloons using baking
soda and vinegar so the ingredients
you'll need
are your plain old
vinegar then you'll need baking
soda a
spoon some balloons I would suggest
bigger ones
a
funnel and an
empty water bottle can all right so my
face is cut off because I am going to
show you guys a closer look so you can
tell what is going on so the first step
I am going to take my
balloon and get rid of these other okay
so I'm going to
take this just one
balloon and then I'm going to take
my baking
soda and going to
add a spoon of it into my
balloon just
one spoonful
so here is my spoon I'm going
to add some baking
soda to the bottom of
this might be a little hard but got to
just kind of strch
it and fill it in
there so you get
enough then I'm going to take that to
the
side and there's some stuff some baking
soda in
there and then I'm going
to
fill take my funnel and put it into my
empty
bottle and I'm going to take my cup one
cup and fill my
vinegar
into my one
cup not all the way
but
halfway and then I'm going to fill it
Pour it into my
tunnel so you
get a little
bit
of vinegar into the empty bottle and I'm
going to take these
inside close my vinegar
and then this is the very important part
you want to not spill the baking soda
into the vinegar until you are ready so
kind
of pour
it puts your balloon onto the hole and
then your extra baking soda is onto the
side and if you want you
can put a rubber band around around it
cuz there will be pressure and you want
to start pouring it into the baking soda
the vinegar sorry and then you as you
can see it is filling
up
science
so that will fill up
too and for as how much vinegar and
baking soda you
put is going to be how much you fill up
the balloon so by my 1 cup of vinegar
and one spoon of baking soda into my
balloon it filled up this big but if you
want it to go bigger you can add
more so I'm going to take this
off of the
[Music]
and just a
little baby
balloon there you have it your own
homemade blown up balloon using baking
soda and vinegar this is a fun way of
exploring everyday materials in a new
way thanks for watching and I hope you
guys enjoyed bye
