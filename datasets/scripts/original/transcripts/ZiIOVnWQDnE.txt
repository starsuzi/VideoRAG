Prepared on the grill,
fish is a special treat.
Outdoor grilling makes a wonderful
summertime meal that's juicy and tender.
And won't leave that lingering
fish smell throughout your house.
We'll show you the basic steps
for grilling fish
so that you can get great
results every time.
Step One:
Fresh is best.
Freshness is the key to
superior fish.
Use your eyes, and your nose,
to reel in the freshest catch
Here's what to look, and sniff for.
Fish should smell clean and briny,
never fishy.
The flesh should look unblemished,
and feel firm.
Choose fish steaks and fillets that are
at least 1 inch thick all the way around,
so they'll cook evenly.
Always keep fish cold, and cook it
the same day you buy it.
Step Two:
Fire up your Grill.
If you have a gas grill, set it to
medium heat for ten minutes.
If you're grilling with charcoal,
fire up until there's a good coating
of ash on the coals.
Then bank them to one side,
so you have a hot area,
and a cooler area on your grill.
Clean the grates with a grill brush,
then brush the grates with oil
to prevent sticking.
Step Three:
Grill your fish.
There are different grilling methods
for each kind of fish.
Let's start with firm fish,
like salmon or halibut.
These fish are the easiest to grill.
Prep is fast, too.
Pat the fish dry with paper towels.
Brush it with olive oil,
and season with salt and pepper.
Then, place the fish directly on the grill.
If cooking salmon with the skin on,
place it skin side down.
Let the fish cook for 3 to 5 minutes.
And don't move it.
Then, use a metal spatula to turn the
fish over.
Do this carefully, so it doesn't
fall apart as it cooks.
Check for doneness after
another 3 minutes.
As a general rule, fish takes 10 minutes
to cook for every 1 inch of thickness.
Your fish is cooked when it easily
flakes apart with a fork.
Remember, food continues to cook for a
few minutes after you take it off the heat.
So remove the fish just as
it starts to get flaky.
Tuna is another firm fish that you
can cook this way.
And many people prefer it rare,
to medium rare.
If that's the way you like it,
just sear it quickly over high heat
for a couple of minutes on each side.
Continue to cook it until it's done the
way you like it.
Less firm fish like, tilapia and sole, are more
fragile, and can break apart while grilling.
These fish need the protection of a container,
like a wire fish basket or a foil packet.
Place the fish, with seasonings,
on a piece of foil.
Fold it up, seal the edges,
and place on the grill.
Put the packet for 3 to 5 minutes per side,
depending on how thick the fish is.
Open up the packet to check
for doneness.
Kabobs are an easy way to cook fish with
a great presentation.
They cook quickly, and are easy to serve
and eat. And look beautiful for parties.
The best fish for kabobs is firm varieties,
like salmon or halibut.
Cut the fish in chunks,
or long strips.
Thread the pieces onto thin metal,
wood, or bamboo skewers.
If you use the wood or bamboo,
soak them in water for about 20 minutes
so they don't burn on the grill.
For a bright boost of color and flavor,
alternate fish on the skewer with
pineapple, sweet peppers,
or cherry tomatoes.
These all cook as quickly as the
fish.
Simply brush with oil, then grill
until the fish is done.
Add marinades, rubs and sauces
with herb and spice mixtures
from around the world for
exciting taste variations.
There's an ocean of flavor
waiting for you.
 So dive right in, to grilled fish!
