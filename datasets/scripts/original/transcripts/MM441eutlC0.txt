here on the left I have my dad famous
chocolate chip cookie recipe and as you
can see it's nice and thick it actually
bakes up really well he loads it with
lots of chocolate chips and it just
tastes great so I've tried to imitate
his recipe using dehydrated ingredients
of course flour and sugar are already
dehydrated ated but I've changed the
eggs into egg powder and the butter and
crisco into shortening powder and butter
powder so um those are the simple
changes um to make this a just add water
recipe and as you can see they look
practically identical and I'm really
pleased with the way that this turned
out because it's going to show you guys
that you can make a just add water
recipe even something as fun as
chocolate chip cookies and have it turn
out
[Music]

going to do a taste test tonight I'm
