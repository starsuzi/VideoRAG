hey everyone its el hare of easy living
with el also known as the frugal chick I
am popping on today real quick to share
with you a simple and easy imitation
crab salad recipe so here is the recipe
and I simply doubled it because I'm
using two packages one is the flake
style and the other is the chunk style
this is a quick and simple and easy
recipe so here are all of the
ingredients that I will be using lemon
juice garlic powder pepper as well as
some salt the garlic powder was not a
part of the recipe but it was something
that I chose to end
so here is the bowl that I will be
mixing the salad in and again as I
stated earlier I have two different
types of the imitation crab salad
one is the flake style which I will be
separating and one is the chunk style
and both of these are a 8 ounce package
here is the crabmeat
that is already mixed together you can
see the flakes versus the chunk style
and I'm just simply mixing it all
together so that I can go ahead and add
the seasoning here's the lemon juice
that I will be adding and following this
I will be adding the rest of the
ingredients here's the pepper and I will
just use a small amount of pepper
and now I'm adding the salt following
that will be the garlic powder
okay guys so this is the absolute last
ingredient that you will be needing for
this salad and I chose to use real
mayonnaise and I love the Hellmann's
brand I'm not a fan of Miracle Whip or
any other salad dressings I prefer real
mayonnaise in my salads so I am just
mixing all of the ingredients together
and once I finished with the mixing I
will go ahead and put a top on this and
chill it in the refrigerator for at
least about an hour now I absolutely
love this placement I pick this up a
couple of months ago from my local
goodwill as well as this personal size
blue willow water pitcher and look at
that gorgeous pleat that was thrifted as
well
I'm also going to use my favorite Ritz
crackers the garlic and butter flavor
I just cannot have a cold salad without
these so the salad has chilled for over
an hour and what I did was I place some
fresh green leafy lettuce
on a plate and topped it with the
imitation crab salad and garnished the
sides with some fresh tomatoes and my
favorite Ritz crackers
