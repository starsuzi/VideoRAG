hey guys today I'm gonna show you how to
sew on a code button first you place it
and then you pin it in place make sure
to fill out your pockets so you don't
sue through it later
I found out my needle and then I placed
the back button that comes with this
code button behind the main button using
the pins I used earlier to place the
first code bond and then I put my
shredded needle through
[Music]
so I put my needle through once and then
I placed a pin on the back button to
prevent the button from being so not too
tight so then I pull the needle through
a couple more times and move to the
other side of the button and pulled it
through there a couple of times as well
finally I remove the pin I push the
needle through underneath the button not
through the bottom holes
then I live my thread around the base of
the buzzing a couple of times and
finally push it back through and then I
finish it off with a knot
[Music]
I cut off the excess strings and that's
it a button nice and place again thank
you for watching
