hello I'm Sharon kley from Pine Valley
quilts and I'd like to show you how I
turn the edges around my applique
flowers you can see here I have a
template cut out and this is the shiny
side facing up and then when you turn it
over you've got the paper side which is
against the wrong side of your
fabric I've cut it out with roughly a/4
in seam or thereabouts but not too
small so the next thing I'm going to do
is clip my
intersections so I'm going to clip into
the vs I don't clip right in I just
leave a few
threads
um I find a few clip right and you might
get some
fraying so there we go just one more to
clip and you can
see you can see how um how far in I've
gone on that
one so now I'm going to turn my Edge
onto the shiny side of the freezer paper
so I take an oil just a general sewing
oil
I've only got the template secured with
flower head pens I don't use glue unless
I absolutely have to and this keeps it
nice and
secure so I'll start I usually start
somewhere that's not an intersection so
I'll start at the top and I just use my
iron to seal that down in
place
so I'm just sealing the edge with my
iron as I go
around keeping
it just pulling it against the edge I'm
not pulling it too tight so that
it crumples the edge I'm just pulling it
close enough so that it's there when I
touch it with the iron cuz the iron is
actually what's doing the work cuz it's
sealing the fabric against the freezer
paper it's the all only holding it in
place
and you want it nice and close to the
freezer paper Edge you want it tuned
over the edge cuz
that's that's the pattern that's how
you're going to get nice beautiful edges
around your
applique and as you're pulling
it you're just taking little
tiny
gathers around larger pieces like when
you go around outside curves you'll get
little
gathers so I'm just running my iron in
so it's underneath this bit but it's
actually on top of this bit and it's
sealing it in there and then when I hold
my o against the
paper and pull it down that's my other
sides coming down now so I can iron that
in and it's it is very easy it's not a
difficult thing to do it just keeps your
seam allowance nicely against your
template and makes it easy to
stitch I like freezer paper because it
provides a stabilizer in my fabric it
keeps my fabric stable it stops it from
distorting or stretching or doing any of
that horrible stuff my ey stitch by
machine I don't very often hand Stitch
although you can hand Stitch this down
that's your personal choice my personal
choice is to use the sewing machine
because I got way too many designs in my
head um to take the time to hand Stitch
and personally I really like the machine
stitching it gives a nice firm Stitch
against my applique um it looks really
good you can't see it it's
invisible and it holds nice and firm and
I know that my applique shapes are going
to stay stitched down for a very very
long time they're never going to come
undone like perhaps a hand Stitch would
so that's what I really really love
about the
machine everybody has a personal
preference and that that is truly my
preference to stitch by
machine I also suffer from a bit of RSI
and so
the machines my friend so now you can
see the back side with all the seams
secured so I can take the pins
out and when I turn it
over so you can see the right side you
can see how
beautifully turned the edges are and
they're neat and tidy there no little
fraying bits they're all secured around
the edges so I hope you enjoyed my video
showing you how I turn my edges on my
flowers I might do a next video will be
to build all the pieces of the flower
together um and Stitch them down in
place so that I've got a whole flower
unit as is
with this one that I've been doing and
you can see I've got circles
which I showed in a previous video so
you can see my layered circles and I'll
Stitch all that in place on top of the
flower before I actually Stitch the
flowers to the background which means
when I'm stitching flowers onto borders
I don't have to move my B borders and
turn things around so much because I
only have to stitch around the outside
once so that'll be my next video I'm
glad I can share this with you I hope
