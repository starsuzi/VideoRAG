Welcome to miss trendy treats. I'm missy and today. I'm showing you how I made this three-tiered Minion cake with banana flavored buttercream frosting
So despicable me 3 is actually coming out minions always stand out. They're so cute
I just want window every favorites are stewart Bob and Kevin I wanted to showcase all the three personalities
Into one cake so that is what I'm doing today
I am making a minion cake best part is that the buttercream frosting is banana flavored
You're not a fan of bananas
You can always change it up
And you know do it the way you want but for this cake because it's a minion cake
We are going to do banana using my favorite buttercream recipe
I changed out the butter and almond extract for two teaspoons of Banana extract
I will leave a link to this buttercream recipe in the description Box below
Once I finished making my buttercream. I added yellow food coloring and mix until combined I
then leveled and crumb coated my three tiers to get to how to's to leveling and crumb coating a cake check out my
tutorials in the description Box below
Once my cakes came out of the fridge. I frosting my cakes and then smooth them out with a bench scraper
Isn't enough bubble tea straw for support
I inserted it into the center of the cake will you litter on a little?
Cut us a frosting line and then push it back in I did this a total of five times
and then place my second tier on top I
Added three more straws into the second tier and then place the third here on top
Using these three Bamboo Skewers to connect the three cakes together I?
Push them down through all three cakes and covered up the hole with more frosting I
Will leave the links to these printables in the description box so you can use the same ones as well?
starting with Bob
I cut out of toggles and tongue keep the rest of the template to help you line everything up later
I use this cookie cutter. That's about two and a quarter inches in diameter to press out two circles out of white fondant
To make gray I mixed a little bit of black fondant with a larger amount of white fondant I
Used this three inch diameter cookie cutter to press out two gray circles
and then use the other cutter to press out the center I
Place the white circles into the center of the Gray rings and then put them aside
using a larger end of my tip number 12
I pressed out one brown circle
And one green circle and then place them close to the edges of the white circles I cut the inside edges of the gray circles
so they were flat and then push them together to make sure they lined up I
Snaked out a piece of grey fondant and then cut it into half-inch pieces
These are going to be the links for the outside of the goggles I
Then connected everything together with water
For the pupils I use the smaller end of my tip number 12
to pop out two little black circles and then adhere them with water I
Use water to apply the goggles to the cake close it to the top of us here
So I have more room for the tongue
I added two of the grey lengths on each side of the goggles keeping them center to the outside of the goggles I
Cut the tongue out of pink fondant lined my template up to the goggles and stuck the tongue to the cake with some water
Spira meant it was a little bit of brown food coloring to sort of give the tongue a
3d look but in the end. I changed it out which you will see in a little bit
Pursuer I cut out the goggle using the same cookie cutters
I used for Bob and then began working on his eye using my two and a quarter inch cookie cutter
I cut out a circle from yellow fondant
cut out the yellow portion of the template laid it on my circle and then cut around it I
Adhered the inside of the eye to the goggle with water and then cut out the white of the eye with white fondant
I applied that in the middle of the eyelid with water and then popped out a brown circle using the larger end of my tip
Number 12 I cut it down
using my
template popped out the pupil with the smaller end of my tip number 12 and then cut it in half out of black fondant and
Then just stick it together with some water
I added a small Sprinkle for the catch light and then applied it to my eye with my template and water
Since he has just one eye
I applied it to the center of the second tier with water the Kevin
I followed all the previous steps for his eyes and applied them to the top portion of the third tier with water
I
Rolled out a thin piece of black fondant and applied it underneath the goggles at a slight angle
For the straps to the goggles I snaked out a piece of black fondant
And then rolled over it with my fondant roller to Flatten and lengthen I
Cut it down to 1 inches wide and then use my rating tool to add an indented line into the strap
Applies the strap to the cake against the length would water
The link will be determined by the diameter of your cake
So here is where I change the tongue I rolled out a very thin piece of brown fondant about three and a half inches long
At about one inch off the end of the snake piece and then placed it onto his tongue with the longer strip going downward at
An angle and the shorter piece curved just above it to Kevin's here
I rolled out black fondant into four inch strips and set them aside to Harden overnight if you are making a cake for the same
Day you can always use gum paste to make his hair heart and clicker using some blue frosting fitted with tip number 21?
I
covered the scene between the case with a
Seashell design by squeezing the bag to build up the frosting slightly and then releasing pressure as I drag the tip downward and away
This part is optional, but I roll tiny balls of gray fondant and then adhere them to the outside of the goggles with water
add
Kevin's hair I cut out a
Small x into the top of the cake where I wanted to put each piece of hair and then push the pieces into place
And that's it
So here you go guys here is our banana Minion cake that we made today
We've got Kevin with his little spiky hair because we have Mr.
Rule breaker stewart in the Middle who seemed clearly annoyed at Bob who is at the very bottom having fun and
blowing raspberries
