you can see there's a lot of orange
pill anyway U I'm going to teach you how
to get all this Orange Peel out and get
it nice and glossy so I'm getting ready
to sound now um pretty much what I'm
using today would be uh again these
three sandpapers here 1 12200 1500 and
2,000 um I'm going to use this block
here just so I get a flat Edge um
especially on these imperfections and
stuff just to get it
flat and um this water bottle here it's
just filled with a little bit of soapy
water um warm
water um just to help
it Glide along the surface easier all
right so let's get started all right I
don't know if you guys can see this but
you see these little Rings here that's
when like dust or rubbish falls into the
paint while it's drying
so what I do is again with the block I
pretty much tick the
Sandpaper Focus take the
Sandpaper wrap it around the block like
this with the surrounding area pretty
good pretty
much all right now it's gone so that's
how you get get all those little rubbish
spots out of your
paint all right so now once this is all
sanded I'm going to be buffing it um
this is what it's going to look like
after it's buffed been buffed see how
nice and glossy that comes and it's not
as um orange
peel but anyway all right so here's a
tip when you
buff um the disc when you look at it
like this it tells you which way the
disc is spinning so in this case it's
going to spin towards the right um
anytime you're going to be buffing these
edges you want to make sure that the
wheel
Buffs off of The Edge not onto the edge
because if it Buffs onto the edge um a
lot of times it can burn through the
paint really quickly so make sure you
hold your buffer where as the wheel
would be spinning off of the lip or off
of The Edge not on it
so the buing is
done I'm going to wipe it
down and then I'm going to go ahead and
try and polish this out all right all
right so I finished polishing it um what
I ended up doing
was going to the store and I picked
up e
a lot better than what it was I think
there's a
dent
here this section
here but
yeah um I'm going to be doing the these
pillars here so I'll show you how to do
that all right so I have this trim piece
here that goes on this pillar
here um I actually painted this black
too redid it black um so
I went ahead and sounded it with 12200
then 1500 and then in
2000 so just so you get the basic idea
I'm going to go ahead and buff this
right
now um same as I did the roof so you can
see what is the upcome and the steps
that I did all right so pretty much what
I'm going to do
is stick it on the car
take
that my
buffer I'm going to start with the
buffing pad the orange buffing pad and
the
mgu I'm not going to use the big buffer
because it's only a small piece so I
don't think I'll be needing that much or
I think that'll be too much like an
Overkill so pretty much going to do this
the
then I'm going to wipe it
down I'm go ahead and go with the black
pad now here using this mirror glaze
show car glaze number seven magars
Maguire damn it
head and give it a good
wipe then I don't know if you guys can
see that but this is the pillar here
just so you guys get the
idea so to recap pretty
much you sound the surface down I
usually start at about, 12200 then I
work my way up from 1,000
[Music]
1200 to 1500 and then 2,000 um the trick
is to make sure you get all the
scratches out from the previous grit
that way it doesn't show through like
this
here you can see some scratches that I
didn't get
out these are probably the 12200 gr
scratches
um so I'm probably going to just go over
this roof lightly
once um maybe with, 1500 and 2,000 and
then rebuff the whole thing but I mean
it looks a lot better than it was before
so yeah like I was saying um go ahead
and buff it out with your buffing wheel
with a wool pad um I
used the fine cut buff compound from M
Maguire's not this one
um this one
here or you can use a Turtle Wax one
like the one I used in the beginning of
the
video then I went ahead and use a DA
polisher with
with the orange
pad and then I finish it off with the
black pad with the sh car GL sh car
glaze and as you can
see gives me a pretty good finish so
this just the way that I do it um if you
like this video if it was helpful for
you please like this video subscribe for
more updates on my Z
uh more projects that I'll be doing in
the future futuring this
Z so yeah um thanks for watching
