[Intro music]
Leeks have their own way to be washed. 
If you have the roots just cut them off. 
Then look at your leek and usually I like to remove 
the first layer because the leaf is always 
more yellow or very damaged. 
So remove the first layer. 
So just peel it off. There we go. 
And then trim both ends of your leek, 
which I did here, like so. 
And count from the root side about an inch and a half, 
which is about five centimeters. 
Start to cut from there to the extremity of the leek. 
On both ways. 
So you split your leek really into four pieces. 
Not cutting that part. 
This part will keep all the leek together, 
otherwise if you are cutting the leek through, 
it will split in many pieces. 
It will be difficult to handle. 
Then take the leeks to the sink and wash them thoroughly. 
Turn the leek upside down. 
You may use a shower if you have one. 
And really open the leek and with your thumb, 
you know, push the dirt or the soil away. 
[running water] Keep your leaks tilted while you wash them 
that's so the dirt will go down. Good. Next one. 
And make sure you're using cold water. 
There's no such thing as warm water. 
The leeks don't need to cook now. 
So cold, cold water, nothing else. 
Your leeks are now ready to be used as per your recipe.
