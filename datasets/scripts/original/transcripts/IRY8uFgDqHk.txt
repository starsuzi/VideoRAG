so we picked up some trigger fish
fillets and these are really good it's a
sweet fish if you haven't ever tried it
before
and it's really good when it's blackened
and i am going to blacken some fish for
you today
i'm going to do it very similar to a new
orleans blackened fish
but i'm going to add a little bit of a
tropical or
like a caribbean taste to it by adding
some warm spices too
and i'm serving it with coconut rice and
mango salsa
so here are some of the ingredients that
i am going to use
and i encourage you to adapt this to
your taste
or to your family's taste so i'm going
to make my own seasoning
and i'm using some herbs and peppers
that i dried
from last year's garden so i had some
greek oregano that i dried
along with some lemon thyme and i really
love using my dehydrator to make my own
seasonings i use this to dry so many
different things
i also used it to dry some smoked chili
peppers
the peppers that i'm using in this blend
include
dragon cayenne and lemon drop and i
smoked those
so here's my seasoning blend that i'm
going to use
uh as you may notice i'm also using just
a couple of allspice berries
and so that will kind of give it that
little bit of a jerk
flavor but we're going to blacken it
instead of smoking it on the grill
so i also wanted to make some mango
salsa real quick i'll show you how i did
that
i just sliced down each side of the
stone of the mango
and cubed it right there in the skin and
then
kind of inverted it and cut out the
cubes
and i added two small scallions along
with one jalapeno pepper
and some cilantro i minced all of those
very well
and then just tossed them right there
into the mango
and gave it some lime juice about the
juice from one lime
along with some salt tossed it real good
and i made that a few hours ahead of
time
and then into my compost bin so the food
scraps can go back into my garden
now for the trigger fish trigger fish
has some pretty big pin bones
in here so we want to make sure to get
those out so on the rough
side of the fillet i just like to feel
for
the pin bones and they're really um
pretty big here so
when i fill it i just get my needle nose
to pliers
and hold that flash and pull that bone
out
at an angle so we don't want to use the
skin
side that's nice and smooth you can find
the bones easier
with your fingers right there on the
rough side
and there's usually about five or six of
these
and so we'll just go in i found another
one here
hold the flesh down and then pull it out
at an angle they can be pretty tough
it's almost like
extracting a little tooth or something
and you definitely do not want to eat
these
so in we go and then add an angle
give it a pull and there you go so i
went ahead and dusted those
very liberally with the seasoning
and my cast iron skillet was heating up
so i
am using about two to three tablespoons
of safflower oil
for my skillet and that's for each filet
my skillet measures about
10 inches so i just want to make sure i
have enough oil to
coat it very well and then have just a
little bit extra
about another tablespoon extra and so
you'll need to adjust this according to
the size of your skillet
you may need a little bit less for a
smaller skillet or a little bit more
for a larger skillet and i'm doing this
completely different than a new orleans
blackened
fish okay i'm doing this a little bit
differently and now
in goes the fish and i'm on about medium
to medium-high
heat you want it to be pretty hot
because we're going to
get that blackened that's what our point
is we're going to
blacken the fish okay so i have found
that coconut butter reacts a lot like a
normal butter
so i decided to use this to blacken my
fish
and i'm putting it right here in the oil
if you don't put it right in the oil
it will burn it'll not work out so make
sure you put it
in the oil for it to melt and i'll leave
a link up here for how you can make
coconut butter at home too
you don't have to you know go out and
buy expensive pre-made
coconut butter it's real easy to make
you know if you're doing like a new
orleans blackened fish
that those milk solids and the butter
that you dipped your fish
in will brown as you're blackening it
well i can't quite do it that way with
this coconut butter
so what i do is just toast off the
coconut in the safflower oil you know it
foams up first
and then it'll start to brown just like
regular butter
so it works out really nice i think it
adds a lot of flavor
and it's a little bit healthier too
right so we can't go wrong with that
so once the edges of the fish have
turned pretty white
then you'll flip it and you can just
spoon some of that coconut butter right
over your fish
mine took about eight minutes to cook
this way
my fish is pretty thick and depends on
the thickness of your fish
but i like to give it a little feel
right there in the middle
and see if it's starting to firm up and
if so
it is ready now i'm using some coconut
rice which i showed you how to make last
week it's really good
especially with a spicy fish like this
and a little mango salsa right there on
the side
and of course a little bit of lime juice
as well
and now it's time to dig in it's nice
and flaky
you want it just to kind of pull apart
it shouldn't shred or anything like that
just nice little flakes of fish it's
just delicious
now you can use any kind of fish you can
get your hands on for this
thus it's really pretty easy little dish
it comes together pretty quick and it's
delicious
i hope you can give it a try very soon
