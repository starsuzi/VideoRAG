below so first you're going to grease
and line a 9x 7 in pan and set that
aside now to your flour you're going to
add in the raava OR semolina baking
powder
and the desicated
coconut and then mix everything
[Music]
properly and then you can set that
aside now in another Bowl you're going
to crack open your
eggs add in the vanilla
extract and beat them just for a few
seconds
and set that aside now in another Bowl
you're going to take your butter and the
powdered sugar and beat this on medium
speed for about 3 to 4
minutes and it's going to be lighter in
color and fluffy just like that then to
this you're going to add in 1/3 of your
eggs and beat for 1
[Music]
minute then add in half of the remaining
eggs and beat it again for 1
[Music]
minute then add in all of the remaining
egg mixture and beat for 2 more
[Music]
minutes then you're going to add in your
dry
ingredients and beat on L Beed just till
it is combined in the batter but do not
over mix it
and then you can switch to a
spatula and make sure to fold till you
have a uniform batter and your batter is
going to be very thick then you can
transfer it to your prepared
[Music]
pan and spread it as evenly as
[Music]
possible then bake it in a preheated
oven at 180Â° CI for 60 minutes until a
toothpick inserted in the center comes
out clean
[Music]
just like you can see

here then let the cake cool for about 1
hour or
more and then you can run a knife at the
[Music]
sides and transfer to your serving
