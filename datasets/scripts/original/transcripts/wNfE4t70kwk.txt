The Celtic Cable Stitch.
Hi, Guys!
I'm Kristen and welcome to Studio Knit.
Today, we are knitting up this Celtic Cable
Knit Stitch Pattern.
This intricate design in a beautiful Irish
Saxon Braid and it's perfect for the upcoming
St. Patrick's Day holiday.
For our materials, if you chose, you can use
a cable needle.
They seem to slip out of my work, so I am
going use this double pointed needle and I
painted it pink on either side to help you
differentiate it from my regular knitting
needles.
In this example I'm using size 7 and you can
use any size needle for your yarn weight.
And isn't this so pretty for St. Patrick's
Day?
This is a Malabrigo.
If you're interested, I have a link on where
you can purchase it down below.
I'm going to provide you with a pattern that
I created.
In this color-coded system and I'm going to
give you an overview of what everything means.
Now, before heading over to my website to
get the pattern, I do encourage you to stick
around just a little bit longer so I can show
you quickly what the six different stitches
are in the cabling of this gorgeous design.
You can get really creative with this pattern.
For example, I created this really cute little
coffee mug cozy.
I also have some great St. Patrick's Day DIY
and craft projects.
I will link that playlist down in the description
below.
And if you're excited to do some cable knit
stitching, go ahead and like up this video
and let me know that you'd like to see more.
We start with our beloved slip knot.
We're going to focus on the Cable Stitch Pattern
itself and that is casting on 24 stitches.
Now let's take a look at the 6 different cable
knitting stitches to achieve our pattern.
We begin with C4B and I have this color coded
in red on the pattern.
C4B means Cable 4 Back, so what we're doing
is we are slipping 2 stitches onto our cable
needle and we are going to hold that cable
needle to the back.
Now we begin by knitting 2 from our main knitting
needle
and then we finish it up by knitting 2 from
the cable needle.
Next is C4F, now that is in the color orange
and it's very similar to what we just did.
We are slipping 2 stitches onto our cable
needle, but we're going to hold it to the
front of our work.
Now, we begin by knitting 2 from our main
knitting needle and now we finish it by knitting
2 from the cable needle.
As you remember, I painted the cable needle
pink so that it looks a little bit different
than our regular knitting needle, so you can
follow along.
The next is CR3B, slipping one stitch and
holding it to the back of the work.
Now it's knitting 2 stitches from our main
knitting needle and then are purling 1 stitch
from the cable needle that we were holding
back.
Okay, I think you're getting the hang of this.
So, here we are in green, it's CL3F.
We slip 2 stitches and we hold them to the
front of our work.
Now, we purl 1 stitch from our main knitting
needle and then we knit 2 stitches from the
Cable Needle.
Here in blue is CR4B, it means it's 4 stitches
and we're holding it to the back, so what
we're going to do is we slip 2 stitches onto
our cable needle and we hold it to the back
of our work.
Now, we knit 2 stitches from our main needle
and then we purl 2 stitches from our cable
needle.
Okay, last one.
So, here in purple it's CL4F.
We slip 2 stitches and we hold our cable needle
to the front of our work.
Now we're going to purl 2 stitches from our
main knitting needle.
And then we finish it up by knitting 2 from
the cable needle.
So, my hope is that reviewing these 6 stitches
here in this video is going to help wrap your
brain around the pattern a little bit better.
The only other instructions that you need
to look out for in the pattern.
We have Knits and Purls and then right here
where you see 2x or 3x, that means two times
or three times, so when you see it in the
parentheses, you will be knitting that little
bit either 2 times or 3 times.
Pretty simple.
So, I have a link to this pattern down in
the description below.
It both is on my website, on the website page
itself.
I also will have a link to a printable PDF
if you'd like to use that, which I definitely
do because it helps me sort of tick off each
row with a pen as go along.
So, if you'd like to do that I think it will
come in really handy.
I also want to point you over to my Pinterest
page where I have all of my knit stitch patterns
and those are available to pin as well.
So, I hope you are inspired to knit up this
beautiful Celtic Cable Knit stitch pattern.
