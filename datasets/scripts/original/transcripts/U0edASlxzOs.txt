hi I'm allly Reynolds with alie's
Organics and we're going to show you
cherry tomato plant care first off we
want to do is get our soil ready so we
want to till it we want to add a bunch
of compost to it I like to do four to
six Ines every planting
season we can till this in or we can
work it with a
shovel smooth that guy out
and of course we
need a cherry tomato this one is called
ghost Cherry
heom we're going to make a fertilizer
mix this is just one that I do and I
that I like it's a bone meal green sand
and neem seed phosphorus pottassium and
nitrogen just equal parts just whatever
you're going to be
needing you could also use just an
allpurpose
fertilizer okay first off we're going to
dig ourselves some trench gives it a
good start if we do a
trench we're going to put some of that
fertilizer mix couple of
tablespoons work it into the
soil can go a little bit deeper right
there create a little
pillow for his neck cover it all
up this is a cherry tomato so they're
going to grow big we got a tomato cage
if you got a bigger one certainly use a
bigger one cuz he'll fill
it let him grow up this this about every
3 weeks or so we want to come in here
and give him some more fertilizer you
can do it as much as every two weeks if
he's producing really heavy to uh
they're heavy feeders and they produce a
lot as you know so we're just going to
fill in this little circle that we've
done around the Tomato about 6 Ines away
from the
trunk cover him
up water him
in you'll do that about every two to
three weeks some other things that we
want to do and does have adequate
water so what I've got here is a drip
tape itms water every 8 in so it's going
to let the water go directly down to the
roots not get the leaves itself give it
a good deep watering keep the soil moist
but not
soggy as he grows up you don't really
need to prune these guys because they
just go kind of wild anyways and that's
why you want a nice big cage like I said
something bigger than this
depending on the type of soil you got
will depend on how much water you
actually give this guy like I said you
just want it to be moist you don't want
it to be soggy if your if your soil
hasn't been amended you can add
vermiculite Pete Moss and more compost
to it uh at the beginning when you're
preparing your bed that'll make him
happier because they love to be in good
tilp so this guy's already starting to
get a few blossoms on him so we're
looking at maybe 30 days or less before
we start getting a few little tomatoes
on this guy he'll go all the way through
the season until Frost and great for
salads great for munch on when you're in
the garden there's some tips for you
