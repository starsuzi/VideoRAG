hi everyone this is Clint from D's
vintage days and today we're going to
show you basically how to fix your front
loading washer um that's having drain
drainage problems so what we found with
ours is that we continue to get uh an
error
message saying uh specifically on this
model is
F21 but saying it will no longer drain
and if you can see down in here
it's got standing water sitting in the
bottom of
it uh today we'll just go take you step
by step we'll start by uh cleaning out
the drain trap which we have not yet
done we've probably had this unit for
eight or nine years and I have not done
it so uh I have a feeling it's going to
be a little bit like a time capsule when
we pull it apart but uh just a couple
steps so we'll we'll uh get started so
most of these front loading units have
little area on the bottom that you can
kind of pop off sometimes they're screws
but
ours just pop
off these little tabs you can see so
we'll go
ahead pull that thing off
and slide it to the
side and you can see there
is some Hardware here
just get a little socket
wrench go ahead and pull those off from
there we're going to go ahead and just
uh pop off this
piece and as you can
see has a little guiding pins here for
when you put it back
in and look at
there we have our
catch so what we're going to go ahead
and do next is uh we're gonna grab a
bucket first but then we're going to go
ahead and loosen the cap on that see
what we find let's give this thing a
nice
[Applause]
twist and stuff's already coming out of
it
so pretty nasty see
all right we're going to go ahead and
clean that out a little bit uh I suspect
with as much water it's in this
bucket that
has solved
our yeah we
are we are dry in here now
nothing so just take a quick sec run
your finger into the the hole that leads
right into the pump and you can
feel uh little
propeller deal there and I can just turn
it with my finger but um another one of
the problems could be you know the whole
pump could have been seized and if there
was something in
there you know we'd want to just go
ahead and uh yank it out okay so we got
our trap I mean we've we've cleaned it
out pretty much the best we can and one
thing I'll tell you is that water we
pulled out of there it was pretty stinky
and I had I didn't think about it but
I've noticed on occasion that pull open
that washer
door you know maybe something smells a
little funky or something like that but
um I think we figured it out
because cleaning out that trap there was
a ton of stuff in
there okay we'll go ahead and put the
Trap Back
In make sure it's nice and
tight I'm going to run a test load
through it come back in a minute or two
and let you guys know if it
worked okay our clothes are clean let's
take a
look there is no standing water that
sucker is dry as a bone okay now that we
know our problem solved we'll just go
ahead and uh reattach our two front
panels like I said it's just the three
pieces of hardware
uh for the one that covers the Trap and
then we'll probably just clean this out
I'll get my old uh concrete bit back and
uh we can call it a day so hopefully you
