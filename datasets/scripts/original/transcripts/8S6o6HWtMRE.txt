Alright drink we're about to make is called
the Extra Fuzzy Navel. So if you're looking
for a super fuzzy drink, this is the one for
you. Okay, add two shots of Peach Schnapps.
There's one, and two. And follow that up with
three shots of Peach Brandy. One, two, and
three. Next we will add a shot and a half
of Triple Sec. There we go. And we'll go ahead
and mix this up real well. Get it nice and
cold. And let's grab a glass here. And if
you'd like, well let's pour this in here,
and you can serve it just like that, if you'd
like. Or you can add some orange to it, orange
juice. There we go that should give it a real
nice flavor. Go ahead and add a straw, and
that's it. Bottoms up.
