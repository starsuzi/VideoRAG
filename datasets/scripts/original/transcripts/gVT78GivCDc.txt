don't look at me like that hello guys
what's up I'm here right now it's really
evening here I'm having a Samson right
now because he took a bath like two days
ago and the only thing which is not
clean on him is his ears so right now
I'm going to perform ear cleaning so
that let me just comb him because he's
this far it's everywhere
I think he's shading with something so
put your chin up he'd like to be cool in
this area so
so right now I'm going to clean his I'm
going to clean his ear and his very very
sensitive right now very very sensitive
I don't know why but they'll find out
and his ear well it's not so not so bad
it's not so dirty at all baby's happy
like difficulties put some lights on it
alright then okay we'll put more liquid
on it so it loosens the dirt yeah I like
that that sounds it's like
it will be like successful right you
start cleaning some okay first I don't
need to use the q-tip just use the
tissue and move the tissue around his
ear like this so it's really dirty I
thought it's a little bit cleaner
because it's been in indoor pool quite
some time oh my god that's the second
one this is the effect if we're going to
use a liquid cleaner it's easy to use
and it this doesn't hurt his ear and
removing the dirt it's easy and also
you're not going to stay longer in the
ear to remove it
yeah I mean slowly I need to be slowly
because I don't want him to you know
change his mood from like cleaning into
like let me run away
and let me sleep more it's a really
sleepy
like more than more than eight hours let
me just clean it again
okay here is the like the pickle thing
oh the radio race is
no no don't push me baby that's a dirty
after all that's not so dirty unlike the
other the other week it was like a clay
oh sorry sorry I'm going to continue in
the usual
I bought this QT because it's pink if it
is for Samson always pink I know because
we thought Samson was a girl but it's
not we give a shot to the fat of the
municipality it was schemas are you sure
you want to name your cat we said yes
then he just explained or your cat is a
guy you are new to it
okay I think it's not so dirty after all
I thought it won't be dirty you just put
some liquid on it
why no all right
so it's not so dirty mmm no and shake
your hand this is the hard part where
you clean older the canals on his ear
that's ready the clay cuz I have a plant
he was playing with a plan it's a life
plan so not that much and now let's
continue cleaning the other side of
Samson's ear escape so I had to catch
him but he didn't run so fast because I
catching him I think he knows catch him
I need to bathroom again got some sand
on your alright so it will be in the
other ear this is how I clean my dad's
ear don't force him well some sort but
he knows or I know how to like tickle
because there's some area on the ear
with which is it he doesn't like it
what he did they will run away or shake
their head or move those feet like
vibrating thing was just closing his
eyes but I gently gently rub the side of
his ear that's still dirty but if I rub
it and then there's no clay then I will
stop because I always clean him like
every week and sometimes the moss is
like almost 2 weeks I just leave it
especially that he didn't get oh oh oh
when somewhere just for today because
you know I have a plants and eat all
those things I think he got he got sick
on the plant he eat it and then he get
sick so I throw it away change it with
the the brush which I purchased from
carry for and hopefully it will grow
fast because I want him to eat that I
purchase it like long time ago
I'm sorry sorry I think I put a lot of
water in it that's why we catch him look
what I've got in here yes me touch you
sorry Sampson okay last this is last one
please let me just finish it actually
this is like a dangerous position he's
pacing at me and then his claw is here I
could get scratching my body so I make
sure I didn't take off him supposed to
be like he's facing over there

fast

the decoder
get tickled and I hit the clay bunch of
clay see that they can always go to the
vet and have it wash it's so the price
