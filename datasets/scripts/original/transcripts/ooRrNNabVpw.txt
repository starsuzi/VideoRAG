evenly this way first pat your chicken
dry

lay the chicken flat
make a notch in the white cartilage in
the breastbone at the neck end
and a slit on either side of the
cartilage
pop out the breastbone and remove it
entirely

for the grill or the oven and your
dinner will be on the table before you
know it
