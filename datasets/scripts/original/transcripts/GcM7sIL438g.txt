a common problem with toilets is that
the board doesn't stay
up and if you're a block it can be a bit
of a problem cuz obviously you've only
got two
ends there's nothing wrong with this
toilet seeds it just needs fitting
correctly so it's only a quick five
minute job so I'm just going to show you
how to do it now if you unscrew the
plastic
nut till it's loose you should then be
able to grip the actual threaded bar
itself and undo it and then you can
remove
it obviously it's a bit grossy down
there so I'm going to give it a clean as
well whilst I'm
there this is now on the opposite
side and there we go the toilet seat
will now lift
off now that I've removed the two studs
the toilet seat will be
loose so I can just carefully pick it
up and turn it
over if we look at these pieces here
they have a
screw and by removing that screw or
loosening it it means you can swing the
in
around so that when you put the toilet
seat back on it's in a further forwards
position if we just loosen that screw
off by turning it
anticlockwise we can turn turn the base
of the in around and then tighten it
back up
again now when we put that toilet seat
back on it's going to be sat further
forwards which means that when it tilt
back it's not going to fall forwards
again so hopefully we should have cured
the
problem so now we just need to refit the
seat we've actually got some uh packing
pieces here and I think the problem was
before
that these rubber pieces should have
been on the outside of the pot not the
inside so I'm guessing that that piece
goes in there and that bit goes on the
under
side because it'll grip a lot better
then so we're going to try that this
time as
well so this time we're going to put the
rubber washer on the
underside with the plastic
notot and we'll do that at both sides so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to screw that in from
underneath so we're now going to screw
that up into the toilet seat
and for now we're just going to screw
the stud in as far as it will go and
then we're going to repeat the same on
the opposite
side and then we can tighten the nuts

up and now as you can
see with the seat correctly adjusted
it's stairs up in the opp position as it
should do
