I have grape hyacinth and wild garlic spreading
across my Bermuda grass.
How do I get rid of it?
And this is from Eric over in Bartlett.
So, grape hyacinth and wild garlic growing
in his Bermuda.
- Yes.
Basically if he's gonna go the chemical route.
- [Chris] Ah.
- You're gonna use two different chemicals.
- [Chris] Uh oh, okay.
- 'Cause your grape hyacinth you really need
to spot spray that with some glyphosate.
But the wild garlic, your 2,4-D will take
care of that wild garlic.
Of course wild garlic is also known as wild
onion.
And sometimes it may take two applications
though.
- It's gonna be multiple applications 'cause
both bulbs.
- Yes, yeah you're dealing with bulbs there.
Yes.
- Right.
- But those are the two ways to do it chemically,
now if you wanna just go out there and just
pull 'em up, I don't know how much of it that
the person has, you know, they might wanna
do it that way as well.
- Right, I don't know how much either but
we've got a lot of moisture here lately, so
it's real easy now to kinda get your trowel
out and just work it out of the soil, if it's
not too much of it.
But yeah, we're talking about bulbs, and the
thing about wild garlic is this though, I
don't think people realize.
I have it in my yard, every year.
It's a winter perennial, right?
It has little bulblets at the bottom of it,
okay?
But wild garlic actually has leaves that are
hollow and round, while onions have leaves
that are solid and flat.
- [Walter] Okay, okay.
- So I mean, there's your difference.
And, believe it or not, you can actually cook
with the wild garlic.
Have you done that before?
I actually know a couple people that have.
- Actually I just had a pesto made with wild
garlic.
- There you go.
- It was delicious.
- See there you have it.
See weeds are not all bad, you can eat with
'em too, right?
They're not all bad.
But yeah, using the 2,4-D, Weed-B-Gon Max,
or something that of course UT recommends
that you can use.
I would probably use the wipe technique because
those leaves are real glossy.
And then for your grape hyacinth, you know,
you mentioned glyphosate, which is fine.
Read the label.
On all of that.
Okay, read the label.
- And you could also add a little bit of dishwashing
liquid to your solution and that'll make it
stick on there better also.
- Yeah, break that surface tension.
You know, the cuticle.
