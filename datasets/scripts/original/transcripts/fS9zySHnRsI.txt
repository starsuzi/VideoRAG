hello
my name is dennis clark
i'm a certified orthodist
i'd like to share some information with
you today
about cleaning your orthosis or brace
it's important that you wash your
orthosis at least weekly
if you're doing heavy work sweating a
lot then you should do it more often
than once a week to clean the orthosis
is very simple take a wet cloth wet rag
with mild soap on it and wash the inside
of the orthosis covering all the
surfaces
if you have pads in your orthosis be
sure and clean those off as well
when you're done with the wet soapy
cloth take another cloth
wet and rinse the inside of the orthosis
try to get all the soap out
then dry the orthosis completely
repeat that on the exterior of the
orthosis as well
now you're going to need to wash the
straps also
if you can remove any pads from the
straps
and wash them on the back side
trying to get as much of the mess off
from as you can if you need to replace
the pad at that time go ahead and
replace the pad
after you're done let everything air dry
completely
don't use any kind of
hair dryer or heat gun to try and
speed the drying of the orthosis
if in fact you're wearing a leather
orthosis go ahead and clean it with
saddle soap
rinse it off a little bit keep it nice
and as clean as you possibly can
very very important for your personal
hygiene and the hygiene of the orthosis
thank you
