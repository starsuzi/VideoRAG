asalam alikum and welcome to title's
busy kitchen with me titly nian now the
thing about chocolate marble cake is
that yeah it's got chocolate in it but
there's no
marbles for my chocolate marble cake
I've got 250 g of plain flour 250 g of
sugar 250 g of butter at room
temperature cut into pieces 1 tbspoon of
baking powder 2 tablespoon of cocoa
powder 3 tablespoon of milk a teaspoon
of vanilla Essence and four
eggs put all the ingredients except the
cocoa powder into a large
bowl then whisk them all together until
smooth
M smooth
Smo now spit the mixture in two and put
one half into a clean Bowl add the cocoa
powder into one half of the batter and
beat it
in oh yeah we are ready to
marbleize take an 8 or 9 in baking tin
which has been greased and the bottom
has been lined with grease prooof paper
and then put Blobs of the white mixture
into the
tin then fill in the gaps with the
chocolate
mixture then when you've blobbed
everything in use a skewer or I'm using
the handle of my spatula to kind of run
the two colors together a bit make a
marbly type
effect don't overdo it
though all right now we'll bake this at
180° C for about 40 45
minutes after 40 minutes check with the
skewer seems okay now leave this to cool
for 10
minutes after 10 minutes remove the cake
from the
tin and place on a wire rack to cool

that no although there's no marbles in
chocolate marble cake you can make a
true chocolate marble cake by baking

hours do that a thousand times and you
