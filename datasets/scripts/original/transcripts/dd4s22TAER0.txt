okay I'm sitting here with my co-pilot I
five kiddo
boom and the kiddo and I are gonna show
you how we do shifting without a clutch
before we get driving I'm sitting here
with my truck off and I want to explain
a few things quickly you should never
ever ever have to force your shifter
into a particular gear if you ever have
to push hard at all you're doing
something wrong you are wrecking
something somehow along the way if
you're sitting with your truck engine
off you should be able to find a gear in
this case right now it's it's easily
popping into third gear and with the
engine off you should always be able to
find a gear that it will just fall into
it's popping into third incredibly
easily fourth it won't
fifth that pops into so third and fifth
right now it's popping into quite easily
that gives you a kind of barometer or a
feeling as to how hard you should have
to pull to put it into gear when you're
shifting without a clutch if you're ever
pulling harder than that you are doing
something wrong
shifting without the clutch the other
thing that I think people should
understand when shifting without a
clutch is that you never actually let
off on the throttle you only let off on
the throttle enough so that the engine
backs down to where it should be for the
next gear engagement being it's enough
talking you want to get driving okay
meaning if you're at 2,000 rpm and your
next gear is going to be fifteen hundred
you should only back off on the
accelerator enough that the engine goes
down to 1,500 you never want to let go
of the clutch because that's going to
cause a jerkiness when you engage the
next year so enough talking let's get
driving
well we'll go up and down through the
gears a few times here and I'll try and
explain what I'm doing is I'm going nut
parking isn't it killed
let's get driving good some air in here
okay
so this is a ten-speed doesn't matter
the same concept applies whether it's a
six doesn't matter whether it's a
6-speed 8l l 9 ll 10 1315 speed 18 speed
it's all the same the same concept
applies so now let's just get up here
signal
today we go through the signal line
alright
we'll go up and down through the gears a
few times here so when you start to go
here on the throttle and I
start pressing lightly and as I back off
the throttle it's gonna fall right out
of gear
so that's the first thing when you're
shifting you just want to apply light
pressure and as you let off the throttle
it'll just fall out every time you do
not have to push hard I'm pushing like
with two fingers here and then
let off the throttle it's gonna drop
down I do not take my foot off the
throttle 1,500
I'm gonna ship that about 1800 rpm it'll
go down to 1200 every time I do not let
my foot off that throttle
I only back off the fraud
but off
I only let that throttle drop down about
1,500 rpm sorry 500 rpm from where it
was at so 1800 to 1300
light light pressure off I know I
dropped down 500 is rpm and it will just
pop in as soon as throughout the right
rpm not pulling hard
actually I won I bugger not that one I
was on the face of the year because I
didn't get at the right
when I was on the face of the gear I'm
not pushing hard and
if you find yourself at the face sleep
of the year where you can feel it trying
to engage but you're not afraid rpm
generally on
hold it there I will
with the throttle until I find the right
arm
now and
place and we're talking two fingers here
at a ship that's all you need
got a track for up here
down shiftings sort of the same but it's
opposite you obviously have to quickly
throttle
especially if you want the engine great
to work
and I generally downshift at about 1500
rpm
slightly on the face that I hear that
time
so bit of throttle to pull it out
wrap it up drop in
again if your downshifting you got a rep
up in this case 500 RPM that should be
fairly similar for almost every
transmission if you're running the 13 or
an 18 speed it'll be a little bit less
so we're just goes to the gears and
throttle base of the gear again
it's all you
I'm never even if I screw up a ship I
never push hard on the ship there
I haven't had a problem with the trance
yeah
fifteen years of driving
the same truck so
yes and I must be maybe doing something
right
so we're about to shift 9 to 10 here I'm
just gonna put ever so slight plate back
pressure on let off the throttle it'll
fall out as soon as I'm down that
fifteen hundred or five hundred ish rpm
it'll fall back in to 10th and I can
often throttle let it the engine brake
pull us down a little bit
we're gonna put light pressure on
wrap-up
until it falls into the next year
never pushing hard that's a good way
pull over here will maybe start food
start from scratch once more low range
whoa there's a bulldozer there isn't
there kiddo yeah we're gonna go to first
gear let off the clutch no throttle does
it take throttle to get going I'm at 68
thousand pounds trottle
I'm Latin huh but I'm never taking my
foot off the accelerator I'm never
letting the throttle go down
idle
another thing that you never want to do
is let your rpms get too high if you get
way above the
like if you're getting into max rpm
there will be a pain in the ass to get
your truck out of gear you probably have
to clutch it out of here and you're
gonna find yourself struggling to get
into the next gear it becomes a
and emotion as your as
it's generally easier to shift at a
slightly lower rpm
if you're at those lower
accelerating
get used to it at the lower rpm
there's a higher
here again or instead
look at what ghetto
downshift engine brakes on
1,500 rpm right now
and we're gonna put our
Bennett thrown with again assail
to the throttle one three minutes
it's great
it's green wow that's that's for the
other cars though you know we can turn
right now throttle Robonaut
[Music]
[Applause]
that you can slightly practice would be
quite put the truck in neutral here
just closed up here so I'm in neutral
here right now totally neutral if I rev
it up to
we'll say mm you can practice just go
from that to 1,500
another thing that's sort of practice
for your driving here now also I don't
know really what I mean nutriment
high-range gonna drop it down to low and
I'm gonna pick third so I'm on the face
of the gear grab it up slightly until I
falls into gear again not pulling hard
and there we are okay that's how we do
some shift and without the clutch
