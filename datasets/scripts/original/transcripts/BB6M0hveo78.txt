we bought prepared pie crust these pie
crust you can buy in the store they're
not frozen these are in the refrigerated
section there are frozen pie shells I
find that they're not very good they're
kind of tasteless a lot of times they
may be freezer bured and they have a
whole different texture this is just
like a homemade pie crust it has Butter
blended into it it's refrigerated it has
a short shelf life it's easy to work
with and it's going to save you a whole
lot of time what I've done is this is
just regular old FL and we're going to
lay the pie shell out now most of the
time these pie shells are just the
scoots too small the Bottom's usually
fine the top you need because you're
going to overlap a little bit more so
you you may want to roll it out just a
little bit so from the middle out middle
out middle out never roll all the way
across the
pie it toughens the pie shell we're
going to take the other pie shelf again
roll out from the
middle out from The Middle
we're going to fold this
over to lift it up fold it into
quarters we're going to take this
pie unfold
it we're going to fold it over now as
you can see this is got a pretty good
skirt we're not going to have to cut
this hem that's what we call
it and what you're going to do is you're
going to lift it up with your fingers
from here you going to lift it up and
you are going to roll it like two rolls
and then press it down with your fingers
so up together squeeze and go around
