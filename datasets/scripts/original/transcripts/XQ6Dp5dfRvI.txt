right today Matt's literally just
throwing this on me like a minute ago
I'm like steal my pajamas like he wants
me to make prison wine where I see it
prison wi's
basically well just B exactly what it
says it's just [ __ ] wine made them
Prisoners the idea is you get all these
fruits and like um fruit cocktail and I
don't know what the [ __ ] ketchups
involved well I I've watched a couple of
YouTubers doing it one of them we in
prenti if you want to check out other
people doing this there's a link in the
description apprenti video so yeah all
right cool we need about 6 to 10 oranges
what do you think about your hand being
cut up cut up being our most viewed
video I'm not surprised it's a pretty
good video counting this as a great
experiment yeah I guess so cuz it's kind
of an
experiment make sure I don't
next we' got to add the fruit
cocktail why use my
hand so
wech up I guess scissors for acidity we
using hind as well and as far as I know
all UK prisoners have Hest ketchup how'd
you know that
[Laughter]
up that looks disgusting now it did look
good all right next is the bread
apparently there's yeast in the well
obviously you use yeast to bre make
bread and apparently it's still in there
to make
a wine we
go want to mix that ye
there is literally a wasp on my hand
right
now and uh we got to we got to lock that
up for a
week uh yeah so it's the we got to like
do warm it every now and then for the
next few days and then in a week we're
going to get
drunk uh it's been seven days in fact
it's been eight days cuz you were hung
over yesterday anyway so we've got this
uh we actually had to pop the bag
because the zipper on the top
broke smells like
cider and it's raining cuz it's England
here's the mash the prune the prison
moonshine the hooch the prison wine all
those names uh we're going to do it like
the prisoners
[Applause]
I'm not drinking for
yours
care it's going to
be yeah that's a lot of C
damage now online it says that this
stuff can be between 2 and 18%
the
train what is this
train that's
a the SI would be so much more easier
but we're doing it prison yeah we we we
we want it to be accurate
left yeah how the hell you get away with
this in the prison
don't this is so much effort for like
half like a sweat
anyway prison wine
Greg just a little sip here and then
we'll next
some that's not one near as bad as I
thought it would be yeah same even
though it's for a sock as well I can
taste the
sock definitely taste the sock it's a
bit
sway
really you got it man you can do it
let's
go it's very strong very thick
oh man that's so
bad okay like the first sip wasn't bad
but you have more than a sip it's uh
quite
bad but if it gets you
drunk you live in
prison what the [ __ ] else you going to
do I wonder I worry that we've like
created some bacteria that's like not
even like science doesn't even know and
we're just drinking it wait don't bring
that [ __ ] up
why that could be
true I'm going to say all that effort
for that taste and like how drunk it
would get you is probably like way no
like no point yeah like even if we had
the whole of that to like ourselves bit
drunk so that was us trying prison wine
um I'll update you in about half an hour
see if we actually get drunk off it um
subscribe like we love
you so what finger prison War Greg
[ __ ] worst thing m i
sick I feel [ __ ] horrible I lit I
feel like what did you make us I don't
even feel I don't feel that drunk I just
feel like I've been smacked around the
head but it's like your brains get
squeezed don't recommend it don't do
it I fired did you hear that
we were supposed to drink that subscribe
