With the winter fast approaching, it's
time to dry some mint leaves.
We need to clean these scissors
first with rubbing alcohol.
Now we are going to wash these thoroughly.
I'm going to space these mint sprigs out
evenly with enough space for them to dry.
And I think they will dry in many hours.
So I'm going to take it, tie into it, put it into a loop.
I have a whole method here.
Look at that. Just tighten it up.
Just scrunch it up.
Let's take one of these guys out.
Look how dry this is!
Now you'll find people on the internet
saying that you know you shouldn't crush it
cause the smell goes or the flavor goes, but I mean I use this pretty often so this
won't happen to me.
This is the end
result and it has such a powerful
fragrance like you wouldn't believe.
Now I'm going to show you the only
reason why I bother drying mint leaves. I
do for the sole purposes of this recipe,
"salad shirazi". This is a popular 
Iranian salad that I
eat all the time and it is very easy to
make.
Dice a bunch of cucumbers, tomatoes and an onion.
Then add olive oil.
White vinegar, you want to be very
careful with this step because too much
vinegar could easily ruin the salad.
Then add some salt.
A bit of pepper.
And a lot of mints. You want to be very
generous here, I almost used everything I dried up.
Yes, it is worth all this effort
for just one salad.
Bonus some of the cucumbers came from the garden!
This is a salad that will surely be a highlight of your day!
