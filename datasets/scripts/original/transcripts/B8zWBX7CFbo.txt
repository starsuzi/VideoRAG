hi welcome to Chris Cook for YouTube
today I'm going to be preparing oxtails
this is going to be my Sunday's dinner
but I'm preparing it on Saturday now
with that I'm going to have cabbage and
I'm going to have macaroni and cheese
along with cornbread what I will do in
the next video is I will do the
smothered cabbage and then in the
following video
I'll do the macaroni and cheese I know
that I do have uh two other versions of
macaroni and cheese but this one has a
little bit of a Twist to it so I'm going
to go ahead and do this one online just
to show you uh this preparation so let's
get started here are some of the items
that you're going to need in order to
make your oxtails you're going to need
Worchester
sauce minced
garlic oregano
basil
thyme garlic
powder onion salt you're going to need
any type of tomato paste you want to use
I'm using Contra dinina you're going to
need uh I need a chick beef broth but I
didn't have beef broth so I'm going to
use two beef bullon cubes and these are
kind of oversized so if you were
probably doing it with a regular bullan
Cube You' probably use
three I'm going to use my lipin onion
soup mix and you know in any dishes that
I prepare of this type I always use this
is my favorite stapler in the world
lipin onion soup mix I have potatoes
down front that's for my roasted
potatoes I have
carrots celery and onions to go in my
oxtails now this is my bag of oxtail
Tails I got them yesterday at the we
have a Jamaican Market here in Virginia
Beach and I got them now I want to show
you something because normally I like
for my oxtails to have fat on it like
mostly like this one see this one has
fat around the edges but in the Jamaican
store they normally trim the fat off of
it which is fine it doesn't matter if
you do it with fat on or fat off any way
you prefer I just like mine with the fat
on so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go away I'm going to wash these
oxtails I'm going to get the seasonings
prepared and I'm going to cut up all of
my vegetables and what I'll do is I'll
come back and show you when I'm ready to
put the seasonings on the oxtails now
I'm going to sear these oxtails first
there's several different ways you can
make oxtail and everybody has their own
way but this is a good recipe that I
wanted to show you for those who don't
know how to cook oxtail and for those
who want to try something different so
I'm going to go away get this prepared
for searing and I'll be right now we're
back and I've cut up all my vegetables
and I've washed my meat so let's just
get
started okay these are the seasonings
that I mixed together and it was a
tablespoon of each of course you know
that I'm going to put um the um amount
the recipe at the bottom of the video so
you'll just need to know but you don't
need to know how much but I'll just tell
you because I'm doing this okay I had uh
like a teaspoon of oregano tablespoon of
oregano black pepper basil thyme I did
salt and pepper which are these two and
the garlic powder and I said that this
was onion salt but it's onion powder
very rarely do I use onion salt because
I normally just use um my salt and
pepper to do my salt ption of it now
what I did was I mixed everything
together for the sake of time so I
wouldn't be picking up each container
and I just used the back of my spoon and
I got everything all grinded up so what
I am going to do first is to add the
waser sheer
sauce and I'm going to make certain that
I sprinkle this all
over my oxtails
I'll mix them up just to make sure that
they all get
some
[Applause]
okay okay now I'm going to add to that
my
seasonings so I'm going to coat with
this side
and then I'm going to put it on the back
side making sure that I use every bit of
it now once I have that seasoned I have
a bag of flour here which is just one
cup of
flour and I'm going to put these in the
flour now a lot of people don't cook it
this way okay and I have not I have
cooked it other ways but this is the way
I want to do it today and the reason why
I am using this
flour is because I want to sear it and
what I'm simply doing when I sear is I
want to lock in the flavor of this meat
so I don't want it
like um I don't want it all shredded or
loose I want to lock in the flavor of
the meat and keep my
meat uniform exactly like it is so I'm
going to put all of it in here and you
don't have to have a lot of
flour you just have to have some flour
on
it then I'm going to R mix it up
to make
certain that every bit of it has been
coated with the
flour like I said you don't have to coat
it like you're coating your chicken but
let it be
coated
okay now once all of that is coated and
it looks like
this I'm going to wait five minutes and
then I'm going to take it to the stove
and I'm going to Shear it so or sear it
I'm sorry so what I'll do is I'll wait 5
minutes then I'll me the stove and I
have my pan on the stove and this is the
amount of oil that I have in the bag in
the bottom really just enough to cover
the bottom of the pan now if you are
going to fry
chicken your chicken would be your flow
would be totally coating your chicken
like that now for these I didn't here is
one you see the difference in that this
is all you need because what I'm trying
to do is not only to sear this meat I
also want a
gravy on this meat which is a thick
gravy and I'm going to get
that
from the
flour so all I'm doing actually is just
Browning it
and I had
to put another bag
on because my bag bursts but that's what
happens when you use bags so I had two
on but apparently the two wasn't enough
so I had to add and you're going to
Brown this on all sides
and I have my stove on kind of like a
loaf and once I get them all
in where I can have my hands
free
then I'll turn my stove up a little bit
now if you could smell the aroma the
seasonings that I used those seasonings
were very important to the outcome of
this
dish
so if when you get ready to make
yours if you could use the same
seasonings that's going to help the
taste of the dish a lot
okay I got a couple of more in here but
I will
um take some out and then put some
in so I've turned up my stove a little
bit and once this starts to fry up I'll
get back cooking up and I'm turning
some and some is
not ready to be turned
yet okay so um I have to
braise or sear all of these
oxtails but that might take a
lightweight minute but it smells
delicious it truly smells delicious and
I wanted to show you one other thing
this is the bowl that I use for to coat
you saw me when I was coating my uh
oxtails with the seasoning and I wanted
to show you this when you grind up your
seasonings your seasonings go in the
meat they don't go they you don't leave
them all in the bowl now this is a
little bit of the werer sauuce but the
seasoning that was in here they went on
the meat which means that this meat is
going to get all the flavor that the
needs so I'm going to continue to Brown
these up because I do have to Brown them
on all sides and once I get this process
done then I'll come back and we'll move
to the next stage but that little light
coating is going to give this a real
real good thick Rich gravy to the
oxtails which is what I want I just
don't want them to fall apart I want
them to be tender but I don't want them
to fall apart part I want to eat every
piece of the meat and I don't want to
leave the PE the meat swimming in gra
okay down to the last of them taking out
the last of these oxtails now and I'm
getting ready to
move to the next
step and the next step in this process
is to
sauté my vegetables now all of my dried
seasonings were put
into um were put on my oxtails so now
what I'm getting ready to do is to
[Applause]
sauté my vegetables here I have
carrots my
onions and my
celery now I'm going to sauté them up in
about 5 minutes now you notice I did not
clean out my pan
okay I just left all of the pan
drippings and everything in there and
there was a minimal amount of oil that
was still in this pan it was not very
much but it was just enough for me to
sauté up these vegetables so I'm going
to sauté the vegetables up for a few
minutes and then I'm going to get ready
to add the rest of the ingredients
vegetables just a little bit and I hope
you can hear me because I do have my
vent on in the kitchen but my kitchen
smells fantastic and what I'm going to
do now of course I didn't expect the
carrots to get um soft because they're
not going to it has to be cooked over a
period of time and I wanted to say
something about this cook this carrot
because this is going to cook for 3 and
1/2 hours in my oven and I didn't want
the carrot I want the carrot taste but I
don't want you to visually be able to
see the carrots so that's why I'm
putting them in um in the beginning
because I want them to Mush and Mass and
mash all into the sauce okay so
now I have added my
oxtails and while I was
waiting
um while I was waiting for for them to
sauté up um I sent to the store and I
got the chicken broth that I needed but
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add
one of
the beef bullan cubes I'm sorry I got
the beef broth that I needed and I
crumpled it crumbled it up I'm going to
add one of those I'm going to
add my lipin onion soup mix at this
point I'm going to add some
garlic minced
garlic that's about a table
Spoonful I'm going to add a can of
contadina
tomato sauce now everybody knows that
tomato paste or I mean Tomatoes period
acts as a tenderizer on meat so I don't
want to have a tomatoey flavor which I
won
cuz this is going to cook all out and
it's going to disintegrate but I do want
to have just a little bit of that Spice
in the background of the meat now I have
the beef broth it's 32
oz I'm going to add
that and they smell wonderful
all right for the first 1 hour of
cooking this is all I'm going to use in
order to start the cooking process I
will come back after an hour's worth of
cooking and then I'll add probably a
glass full of water and that'll be be
about it until it gets done so I'm going
to put this in my
oven Okay add 300 150° and I'm going to
allow it to cook for roughly 3 and 1/2
hours but I'll come back in the middle
of the process just to show you how it's
doing and show you what I'll add at that
time one other thing too I didn't throw
away my used flour that I had from when
I coated my oxtails because I'm going to
use that toward the end to help um make
up my gravy along with the the uh flour
that's already on the oxtail so get I
just took this out so I could look at it
and I want to show
you see what that flour
did okay see how these have graved up
they're going to cook some more but I
just wanted to show you what you got
from the flour see how it the gravy that
came from the flour I'm going to flip
these
over and see how they're staying
whole they're not and that's what I want
I want them to be whole I don't want
them to be
overcooked in the pot um and then they
become stringy I don't want
that
okay and I just wanted to show you and
flip now all of this is gravy the only
thing I have to do is add some water to
it I haven't put anything in it except
for what you saw in the
beginning so now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to add a little water to it
and I'm going to put it
back in the
oven so it can cook for another hour but
I just wanted you to see that and see
that uh and I've stepped away so I can
get some
water see that and see
that uh how it's graving
up and how good it's going to be I'll be
right back I got to give water water so
hold
on all right I couldn't find my
measuring
um my measuring container so I just have
two
glasses of water here so now look at
it now this gravy is going to continue
to
thicken which is what I wanted to do now
I'm going to put it back in the
oven and we're going to
go for the next hour but that looks good
and I'll be back okay I was going to
roast the potatoes but I'm going
to put the potatoes down
in with
this and these look so good
okay now I'm going to add the potatoes
to
this and I'm about 45 minutes from
completing the
dish and as you can see my oxtail stayed
whole no problems
my gravy is
thick all
right now the potatoes need about 30 to
45 minutes worth of
cooking and the reason why I kind of
dunk the potatoes to make sure that some
liquids get on it is because I don't
want them to hard
roast
okay I want this to cook
easy now we're down to the
last my meat is tender but it's not as
tender as I would like so we're down to
the last 45 minutes of cooking
what I'm going to
do is remember I had that flour that was
left
over and I told you I was going to use
it so I put the flour
in this mixture this my phone somebody
will get
it and I'm going to pour that down in
too
okay and I'm going to put it back in the
oven and we'll see what it looks like in
45 minutes be right back okay now I've
taken the um oxtails out of the oven and
here they are look at the gravy to that
to those
oxtails look at it and then the potatoes
and the
oxtails and all of my oxtails stayed
whole exactly like I wanted them to
stay and let me see
look look at that
meat it just comes right off the bone so
I'm going to go ahead and Dish up this
plate for
you
um let start with these ox
tails okay I'm putting a cup lock tails
and a potato I had a couple of carrots
that didn't disintegrate but that's
okay there you have it in my oxtail
State whole all through the cooking
process but this gravy is just
fantastic okay and now I did the
Cabbage
which I'm going to Dish up some of this
cabbage on the
plate put a piece of that bacon
all
right and
then of course I did
the mac and
cheese I got to hold it because it's off
the and I showed you how cheesy that
was I don't want to drop
the and the one thing that I didn't show
you but I already have this
online is I didn't show

them to find a place to put them on this
