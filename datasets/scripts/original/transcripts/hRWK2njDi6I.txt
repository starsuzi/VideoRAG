In this series, we're going to work with you
on ways to relieve the pain that your dog
might be experiencing from elbow arthritis.
A problem that more and more people are seeing
in their pets is elbow dysplasia which, like
hip dysplasia, is a bony malformation. It's
a congenital problem. A lot of dogs have real
serious troubles moving their elbows from
this particular malformation. What we're going
to show you are ways that we can make your
dog more comfortable by doing some basic acupressure
techniques. Now, before you start this, we
do recommend that you go see your vet, get
your dog worked up completely. Make sure there's
not an underlying problem that should be treated
before you begin the acupressure series. Once
you know that your dog has arthritis or dysplasia
of the elbow, this is a great adjunct therapy
and a great way to give your dog more relief
than he would get just from pain medications
or particular veterinary programs. It's an
ancient method, several thousand years old.
It's worked wonders for people over time and
now we're using it for dogs.
