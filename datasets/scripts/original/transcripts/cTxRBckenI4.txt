in this video I'm going to show you the
cheapest fastest and easiest way to
build garage
shelving just start out by marking the
studs in your
wall then you'll screw a 2x4 the length
of your shelving at a desired shelving
height to the studs in the wall use a
level to make sure that this board is
screwed on
level then just attach additional 2x4s
to the wall through studs in the wall at
desired shelving Heights consider the
height of things that you'll store on
the shelving as you're placing these
boards on the
wall we're using 3in screws to screw
into the studs in the
wall okay now for the fun part you'll
take additional 2x4s the length of your
shelving and you'll screw those to the
first set of 2x4s leave the screws
protruding out a little bit because
we'll be removing these screws later
on repeat this step for all of the
shelving
just two screws are all that you'll need
to hold these boards
on okay now for the legs cut 2x4s to the
height of your shelving then screw those
2x4 legs to the second set of 2x4s that
you attach to the wall we're using 2 and
1/2 in screws here you want to place a
leg on the ends and then if you have
long spans maybe place a third or fourth
leg in the center for additional
support you'll want to screw these legs
pretty good to that second set of
2x4s okay now the fun part we'll remove
those screws that attach the second set
of 2x4s to the first
set and look at that we have a perfectly
matched second leg for the shelving so
easy and simple then we just Ed our
Craig jig to attach cleat to the first
set of
2x4s and then it was a piece of cake to
just take that full leg set and attach
it to the
cleats how easy is that after that we
threw the plywood on top of the
shelving and then use screws to attach
the shelving to the 2x4
framing you won't need a lot of screws
and you can certainly use a smaller
screw here as you're just holding the
shelving boards down and that's it so
quick and easy that we actually made
three different sets of this shelving in
one
