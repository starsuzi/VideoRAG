hey welcome to Atkin DED in the kitchen
my name is Kent ala and this week we're
going to be making another recipe with
these Damascus Bakery wraps that I
featured in my haul video and I also
wanted to announce the winner of that of
the two rap giveaways in that hul video
as well the first one was deard Dora
from South Carolina and the second one
was AB in LA in California so I want to
thank both of those guys for entering as
well as everyone else for entering that
contest by commenting and liking the
video so thank you guys once again and
let's go ahead and get started I have 1
and 1/2 lb of ground beef uh cooking in
the pan
here to this I'm going to add a half
small
onion that I chopped up
earlier and one2 of a green pepper and
1/2 of red pepper for
color to this I'm going to add 1
tblspoon
of my low carb taco seasoning Ms that I
messed up earlier today I'll include a
link to the recipe
below all right I added about a half a
tablespoon that should be enough
you might be wondering what we're going
to be doing with all this mess and and
what we're going to be making today is
low carb Chim Changas my um folks are
one of the people that brought chimy
chongas into Northwest Iowa for the
first time so I'm just going to continue
that to make into the low carb world and
make a low carb Chim chunga with these
wraps so come back in a little bit after
the ground beef and the vegetables are
finished cooking and we'll catch back up
then all right welcome
back going to take my chimy
Changas and put them gently into the
oil I'm cooking these at
350Â° you may have to hold them down with
a fork just to make sure that the top
and bottom get done at the same
time you might be wondering what I'm
going to be serving with the enchiladas
well I'm going to be making the um
covering them with a a dollop of Las
plas enchilada sauce uh the good thing
about the Lost plas that I just got at
Super Walmart was that it's made with no
sugar on the label so I don't have to
necessarily make my own enchilada sauce
if I can find this
one and we'll serve it with a dollop of
sour
cream all right now we're going to take
our two forks and attempt to roll it
over this is one of the reasons why you
want it really really um sealed up well
with your
toothpicks and we're going to leave it
in in here for about oh 20 more
seconds I want to thank you guys for
watching I hope this reaches everyone in
great health I'll talk to you guys later
bye
