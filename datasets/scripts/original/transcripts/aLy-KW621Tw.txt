they're thin they're round they're
relatively flat unlike the earth and
they're affordable pancakes and i'm
gonna show you a whole bunch of ways to
make them that you never thought
possible life can be a struggle but a
good meal doesn't have to be we can make
creative nutritious and inventive dishes
for under two dollars a plate
all right class is in session pancakes
101 i'm going to show you how to make
the mix i'm going to show you proper
technique and i'm gonna add things into
the pancakes by turning the pancake into
vehicles like ufos of flavor so strap in
and get your notebooks ready if you were
to make pancakes flapjacks discs of
affection the best way to do it is to
make your own mix because when you buy a
pre-made mix you're literally paying the
man to do this work for you let's save
the dough ray me and do it now here is
the struggle pancake mix you start with
flour one
two
three four and one half
the main thing with pancakes is that you
want them to lift so that air gets in
there and that happens with baking
powder we need four teaspoons
of baking powder look you can come right
up on this little lip here
that is something i like to call
precision some salt even if you decide
to go sweet with your pancakes salt is
good because salt makes sweet sweeter
two packets of sugar
the struggle whisk 7 500.
all right just bring it in this is our
mix it is not wet therefore it is not a
batter we've got the struggle funnel oh
oh this is working well so now we have
pancake mix that is ready to become a
batter and it will sit on the shelf and
last a very very long time but how long
is a long time it's hard to say but it's
even harder to say if you don't label it
here's our pancake mix now it's time to
make some pancakes before we make any
crazy pancakes we've got to do the
basics so this is the most basic pancake
recipe you don't learn algebra before
you learn how to add do ya here we have
some milk
an egg
and melted butter homogenize
we've got our wet ingredients here come
the dry ingredients one and a half cups
of pancake
mix when pancake mix
meets wet ingredients it becomes pancake
batter the struggle whisk 7500 is so
user-friendly you know some lumps in
your pancake batter are okay it is
important that you let your batter relax
for about five minutes which turns out
to be just about the amount of time your
pan needs to heat up in the meantime
it's time to heat up some bacon i don't
know why the french man is here but he's
here bacon is arguably the greatest
flavor ever created
it's time to make the flapjacks
boom boom boom this is a very good sign
ba-da-boom
depending on how thick your batter is
bubbles may form at the surface in
either large numbers or small crowds as
you can see around the edge here it is
becoming pimply let's say and now is a
great time
to just take a peek underneath and you
flip over
and don't push it down
we have baking powder in there baking
powder is creating a chemical reaction
that i'll never understand because i
don't have the capacity to understand it
but i do know that air is expanding in
there and that gives fluffiness and if
you push it down you're ruining the
chemical reaction
obviously you could put any fruit you
want inside of a basic pancake batter
some people they don't want to have
fruit i get around the fussy eaters by
blistering the blueberries in the pan so
i get all the flavor of a cooked
blueberry and for those that don't want
any they don't have to have it
oh baby oh
baby
bacon
three is company should i put some
butter on it i think we should all right
listen here's how this works no one's
looking you slide a little bit
underneath there okay
and of course right on top we're only
missing one thing
and by the way i do like to get syrup
all over my bacon
this is a dollar ninety-nine this is the
basis of all pancake making
ah forgive me lord for i have sinned the
basic pancake satisfies all the cravings
that i am looking for but because i want
to give you even more ideas and even
more ways to use the food that's in your
cabinet i'm going to show you how to
make even more pancakes so let's do this
it is now time to make something a
little more exotic pancakes that can be
sweet or savory they can be consumed
throughout the day how do we make this
exotic pancake frank we add sweet potato
it fills out it gives you a wonderful
vegetable so i had some sweet potatoes
lying around and frankly i'm sick of
baked potatoes so i peeled these sweet
potatoes i boiled them and now i'm
mashing them and they are going to
become part of my sweet potato pancake
we get an egg
some milk
some butter
mix mix mix
you know we've got a single color here
what i'd like is some pops of other
color so chives or chives i guess it
really depends where you put the
emphasis on the word
so the tribes not only add a beautiful
color pop polka dot thing they also give
you that allium onion spice which is
nice when you've got a sweet vegetable
whose name has sweet in it so you know
it's true sweet potato balance of
flavors the thing is this is sweet i'm
trying to cut into the sweet and that's
why i'm going for cumin and i'm going
for nutmeg
okay
here comes some salt and pepper
boom our pre-made mix here it is and
we're going to put one and a half cups
of our pre-made mix
into our mixture
oh it's amazing how the orange just
still pulls out that's looking pretty
good our pancake mix has been mixed with
wonderful highly moisturized things and
we have created an exotic batter this is
a game i like to call is the pan hot
zabani's hot packet of butter
here we go
i feel like red is going to be a very
good canvas for this painting it's time
for inspection inspection
oh that actually looks really nice
all right
pancakes ooh look at chives we are gonna
make a brown butter sage topping now if
you've never had sage before it's sort
of like rosemary or thyme but i think it
is a whole lot more gourmet
gourmet tastes like the deep dark forest
that's wonderful it lasts a very very
long time sage goes great with potatoes
guess what we've got sweet potatoes and
these pancakes match me didn't heaven
brown butter so butter brown butter
is when all the milk solids start
burning in the pan and you get this
nuttiness the niceness goes really well
with the deep dark forestness of the
sage
some of it is browned some of it has not
i'm gonna swirl
and the sage fries quickly pick it off
the stem i'm using the whole bunch that
they sold in the store often they give
you a lot um this is also a great herb
to grow because it's perennial free
flavor does not only come in a tiny
little plastic bag no seeds are like the
original free flavor
sage you can see the brown butter and
guess what the time for the marriage has
come here we go
oh baby
savory syrup boom boom boom see how
crispy it is it's they're breaking in my
hands they're so delicate i can just
come on with some sage these are only a
dollar nineteen they are exotic pancakes
sweet potato brown butter and crispy
sage make a combination that sounds kind
of loony but i think it's wonderful oh
it's so soft
holy moly
that's really good
mmm this culinary masterpiece came from
our homemade pre-made pancake mix it
tastes like indian naan bread combined
with american corn cornbread in the most
beautiful and wonderful way it was
simple to make it tastes delicious now
it's time to pack even more nutrition
into that mix
you said you wanted more nutrition in a
pancake it is time for me to d-e-l ever
deliver okay swiss chard packs the punch
it's like a nutritional powerhouse sort
of like kale but i think it's cooler the
stems are edible they're gonna be a
little bit cumbersome inside of our
pancakes so we need to get rid of the
stems the best way to do that is to get
a loose circle finger
boom that's it frankie what can we do
with the stems you know it's so funny
that you ask this could work really well
in a stock um you can use this almost uh
like a celery in a sofrito so a base for
a ragu or a tomato sauce or you could
just saute them up and eat them with
eggs or saute them up and put them with
potatoes use your imagination here we go
leaves roll it up
this is a great way to eat a lot of
greens but they could be any greens you
want
the oil of olives
the onion first
garlic
pepper
salt
all right get some color
you get some smells
and the swiss chard goes in
swiss chard is all cooked it's very
important that you let it cool down
because if you put super hot swiss chard
into your pancake mix the pancake mix is
gonna cook
while it's being mixed and then you
can't make pancakes egg
milk
salt pepper
cumin
spin
and here's our pancake mix once again
ready to turn into something else that's
delicious
half one
point five
how about a little parmigiano reggiano i
think it's a great idea
next
yeah at the very least i think you know
how to make a batter at this point swiss
chard
pretty awesome look at that there is no
reason that you should dirty another pan
a little olive oil here a little olive
oil here coming in oh baby
that looks wonderful my third pancake
meal of the day one of the great things
about making your own pancake mix is
that like always you're saving money and
that means you can either take those
extra dollars or pennies and put them in
your pocket or you can spend them on
other items like sausages which are
delicious but a little bit pricey but
affordable because of that pancake mix
and all the cheap ingredients we used
pancake flip
look at this thickness okay that
thickness was achieved by something
called restraint because i did not push
down on the pancakes at any stage during
the cooking process pancake number one
pancake number two
boom so
we've got our sausages we've got our
pancakes what is missing we have to make
a sauce we have gone full savory ladies
and gentlemen and that means that your
typical syrup topping is not right
simple sour cream and bright toppings
that's what we're gonna go for lemon
zest vegetable peeler just go ding ding
ding ding ding and try your very best to
avoid the white part which is the pith
the pith is bitter if you peel it and
you leave that behind you're gonna have
the zest which is bright and good if you
omit this you are throwing away free
flavor and we all know that that means
minus 65 points to you
the cream that is sour into the bowl
that is empty
salt pepper
before we mix that up we're gonna put a
little bit of lemon juice also okay
nice got some good color
here are the pancakes
oh you know it looks like whipped cream
this is a dollar eighty-four savory
pancake swiss chard sour cream topping a
lot of people said it couldn't be done
but i did it it's here now we have it
this is a really great pancake you know
this is good for dinner it's savory it's
delicious it's almost as if i gave you a
breakfast and lunch and dinner pancake
option today
the takeaway from today is that homemade
pancake mix will give you the delicious
pancake that you know and love for
breakfast it is also a vehicle for
fruits and vegetables across the entire
spectrum of food that we have access to
in this wonderful world that we live in
so do not be afraid to take some risks
cause we might not have stacks of money
but we got stacks of pancakes so you
stack them high and i'm gonna say bye
