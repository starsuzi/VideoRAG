hello everyone this is STI and you're
watching me on the creative V Channel
today what I'm going to teach you is how
to make colored sand at home it's not
really sand it's salt but I was trying
this video out last night not the video
just the process of course just to see
if it works all right or not before I do
it on so my friend calls me up and he
asks me like what are you doing and I
tell him you know not many people in the
world can say this but I'm coloring
table salt so my friends get to hear all
the weird things like this and if that
gets you interested coloring table salt
then watch the
video the first thing you need is a
paper as a base next because I'm going
to put the salt in this the colored salt
so I'll just measure
[Music]
it so I need approximately this much I'm
going to color it
next I'm going to use a pink soft pastel
color now what you need to do is start
coloring it this way the color will come
slowly and then starting
[Music]
greasing so now this is
done similarly you can prepare a blue or
any other color for that
matter and then we'll stack it in a
glass so blue goes
[Music]
first next I'm going to put in the
pink now this is
[Music]
done now you can use this to keep your
brushes or you can make a candle out of
it I'll just show you
how don't worry about the colors mixing
it is going to make it look even
[Music]
better here is your
candle or you can create a decorative
piece with ombre
colors or
else something like this
really pretty things right I'm so lucky
that because of these videos I get to
keep so many new things in my home all
the time you can do it too of course and
also I like to put my geek cap on right
now and tell you why the salt got
colored so basically it's because of its
rough surface and you know over time the
color increases because the white
particles reduce so yeah you know just a
quick back for you and if you like the
video please don't forget to like and
leave a comment and subscribe to my
channel and we just had some noise why
do you come when I'm making a video
anyhow I'll see you next time
