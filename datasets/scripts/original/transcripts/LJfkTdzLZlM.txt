hi guys welcome back my name is miranda
and today i'm going to show you how to
make a bahama mama
there are several different ways you can
make it i'm actually going to do the one
with kahlua and until you can have the
coffee flavor in your bahama mama so
you're going to fill your ice up
in your shaker
you're going to do half shots of
longable rum
and kahlua
half shot of your bacardi rum as well
about a half shot of your lime juice
about two ounces of your pineapple juice
shake it up real good
now what we're going to do is strain it
over ice in your glass
this will keep the drink much
cooler for a longer period of time
without watering it down
it's garnished with a flag a orange and
a cherry
