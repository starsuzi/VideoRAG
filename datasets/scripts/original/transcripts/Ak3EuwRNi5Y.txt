stick the pattern to the fabric and cut
the fabric leaving 2 cm distance for the
same
[Music]
allowance here in the video we have
already folded the fabric because for
this type of clothing the back and the
front sides are the same
always remember to not lifting up the
fabric while you're cutting it because
if so the pattern will move
around and here we have got two exact
same fabric
pieces so fold it once again and trim
the excess Fabrics to make sure that it
is symmetrical
now we're going to stitch the arm
[Music]
section you can fold the fabric directly
like the one in the video but you won't
get the best
result it's better to stitch it this way
and then refers it
later here the right side is meeting the
right side and then Stitch it
after we stitch that we are going to
reverse the
[Music]
fabric if you have rers to fabric then
it will look like
that here we are stacking that two
Fabrics
together and then Stitch the arm Section
1 to 2 cm from the edges
depends on how much you left the fabric
when cutting the
[Music]
pattern and then trim off the excess
Fabrics you're also going to want to cut
it as shown in the video to make it
easier when reversing it
later then refr the fabric and Stitch
the sides again
[Music]
the same thing applies for the other arm
section
[Music]
next we are stitching the next
section so we fold the fabric
inwards and then Stitch it all the way
through the next
[Music]
section after stitching the next section
we stack the fabric like this and the
right side has to meet the right side
and then you can stitch the sides all
the way to the
[Music]
bottom now we're going to stitch the
bow so fold the fabric and Stitch it all
the way to the bottom
the width of the fabric is around 8
cm and the length is 120
CM but of course you can customize it up
to your own
[Music]
likings but make sure that the Fabric's
width can fit in the next section that
we made
before and after that we will refres it
and insert it to the next section
[Music]
later now we are stitching the bottom
side of the clothing fold it inwards for
around 3
cm and a stitch from the inner side is
shown in the video
[Music]
[Music]
and now we are inserting the bow that we
made before to the next
section you can use a PIN to help you
insert the
bow hook the front part with the pin and
then slide it in
[Music]
insert the bow until the other end of
the bow comes out from the other hole on
the next
[Music]
section so this is the result of the
dress we made and also the bow that we
have in inserted to the next
[Music]
section and now to tie the bow pull the
bow I shown in the video and then tie
[Music]
it you can also make this dress in an
adult size because this is a CH
children's dress the front and the back
fabric size are the same but of course
you can customize the dress length
according to your own likings
