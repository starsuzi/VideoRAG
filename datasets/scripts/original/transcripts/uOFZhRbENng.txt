all right here's more of the gensing on
the back side of this
planting see what I'm going to do is
just since so many came up we're just
going to wait till the fall to remove
the heavy
leaves and then we won't damage
nothing there's two
there another one see it's still coming
up so I thinking if we move the leaves
too soon we may pull some out do more
damage than good
there like I said this is the spring
planting last year with new Green Seed
and it never was kept moist during the
summer and we got nearly 100%
germination I got the seeds from Hugh
gensing in
Wisconsin thanks for watching
