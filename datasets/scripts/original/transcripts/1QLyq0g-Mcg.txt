Hi!!Namaskar!!!What's up??Hope you all are doing good.I'm also doing good
Today I'm going to give you a recipe for tomato chutney
In my last video,I served this tomato chutney as the combination of rava idli
And I got so many requests for this chutney after that video
Then I thought to make it as soon as possible
So everyone do try it at home
Today i'm going to introduce 2 persons,who have completed the 104 recipe challenge
They are Navya and Roja,two best friends
One lives in Kochi,Kerala and the other person lives in Singapore
But they couldn't send me their video expressing their experience about this challenge.
But I'll definitely show you all the photos send by them
Continue your support always like this and accept such challenges from CW in future also
Now let's see how to make easy and tasty tomato chutney
So let's start now
In a kadai pour some gingelly oil
You can take refined oil or coconut oil or whatever oil you prefer to add
When the oil is hot enough,add 3-4 dry red chilly and saute it till the colour changes
The raw smell should not be there
Its done.Let's transfer them into a plate
Add 2 big onion slices into the same oil
Add enough salt into it
Add 1 tsp of finely chopped ginger
Add 1 clove of chopped garlic
1 clove of garlic would be enough
Add 1 green chilly slit
Add 3-4 curry leaves
Saute them all well to make the easy chutney
I've already posted a video for kaara chutney made with cooker,which is much easier than this recipe
Like the name indicates,that's a spicy chutney.(kaaram means spicy)
Ingredients in both the recipes are almost same.Those who haven't tried it yet,please do try
In this chutney,the flavor of the tomato must be highlighted
So the spice level has been reduced in this recipe
In kaara chutney,I've added almost 6-7 red chillies.But in this recipe,we are adding 3-4 red chillies only
The colour of the onion slices should turn into a light brown colour.Then we can add the tomato pieces into it
Its an easy recipe but the time requires only for this sauteing procedure
You will get the real taste when the onion slices and the tomato pieces mashed up well after sauteing
I've already told you in the egg roast video that,the actual taste would be there only if they caramelize well
So be patient while you saute the onion  and tomato slices
So,saute them well in medium flame till it gets a brown colour
Stir them occasionally
If you are using a non stick pan,there is nothing to worry about sticking at the bottom
You can make the chutney without grinding but sauteing them all like the tomato roast recipe
But in this recipe,I'll grind them all into a fine paste
The quantity of the tomato chutney would be very less after grinding them and I always felt it like a big problem
We need to take more onions and tomato to get more chutney
In normal days,my mom used to make this recipe in this way only.
But if we have some guests at home,my mom used to grind some raw coconut along with the cooked onion and tomato mix
Thus we can increase the quantity of the chutney
There won't be a great difference in the taste.But we will get a smooth chutney as well
If you are staying with your friends,you can use this tip of adding coconut,to get the chutney in more quantity
The colour has changed slightly into brown and its enough
Do not want to make it into dark brown shade because we will saute it again after adding tomato
We have already added salt into the onion slices
Now cut 3 ripe tomatoes( not very sour) into small pieces and add into it.
Size of the tomato slices is not a big deal because we have to cook it well
Mix all the 3 tomatoes with the onion mix properly
If the tomato tastes very sour,the chutney becomes too sour to taste
Cook them well in medium flame by closing the kadai with a lid
When it is cooked well we have to drain the water content in the mix.So let it cook well
Don't forget to stir them occasionally
This is almost cooked well
Now cook them without closing the lid and try to drain the whole water content from the mix
The water content has completely drained and the raw smell has gone and a very nice smell is coming out of it now
By the time you try to drain the water content the mix,if you feel like the oil is less in the mix,you can add 1 tsp of extra oil into the mix
Some people used to add chana dal and urad dal into it.But it is very tasty even without adding them.So I don't want to add them into this chutney
This is done
When it is is cooled down well,let's rind them with th roasted red chillies into a fine paste
This is cooled enough now.Let's transfer them into a small jar
I've already roasted 4 red chillies but adding only 3 among them
After grinding them,we can add the remaining one if the spice level is not enough in the chutney
If the spice level becomes more when you grind them all at once,we cannot reduce them again.So you can adjust it with your choice
So first let me grind it with 3 red chillies
In order to balance the spice level and sourness add a small piece of jaggery or a pinch of sugar into it
Its optional only
No need to add  water into it.If you feel difficulty in grinding,just add some  water(boiled and cooled)
I've made it into a very fine paste
Check the taste and add the remaining red chilly and salt if required
3 red chillies are perfect for me.Adding a pinch of extra salt into it
Everything is perfect now
Usually I make tomato chutney in this way
If you want to increase the quantity,add 2-3 tbsp of grated coconut into it now and grind properly
No need to roast the coconut just add fresh grated coconut only
If this quantity is sufficient for you,you can stop the procedures here itself
Let me mix it once again
Let me check the taste now
Everything is so perfect now
Its really yummy
So the important points to be considered while making tomato chutney are,choose ripe tomatoes,saute them properly which helps to get the perfect taste to our chutney
In my opinion,gingelly oil would be the perfect oil for this chutney
It gives a flavor of Tamil Nadu
It goes really well with the dosa,idli etc
If you have this there is no need of another chutney or gravies.
I've added a small piece of jaggery also
First you grind it without adding jaggery and check the taste.Then you can add a small piece of jaggery and grind it.
Then you'll understand why did I tell you to add jaggery/sugar in the chutney
Its strictly optional so you can add/skip this step according to your preference
So this is the easy and tasty tomato chutney
Everyone try this in your kitchen
I'm glad to know that many of you have tried my rava idli recipe.So try this chutney as the combination for it
And don't forget to give me the feedback
