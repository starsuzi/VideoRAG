How to Win at Heads or Tails Every Time.
Go ahead and take that bet.
We’re going to show you how to win at heads
or tails every time.
You will need A coin Time to practice A sucker
and a trick coin.
Step 1.
Flip the coin into the air.
As you catch it, slide your thumb under your
fingers and use it to feel the surface of
the coin.
If it’s smooth, you know it’s heads; the
tails side feels textured and rough.
If you were forced to call a side beforehand
and the coin has landed the other way, nudge
it over with your thumb.
Step 2.
Practice flipping and feeling the coin with
your thumb until you can do it quickly and
stealthily—you don’t want your opponent
to know you’re cheating!
Step 3.
Try another trick.
Holding the coin near the end of your index
and middle fingers, flick your wrist up and
lift your index finger, spinning the coin
like a Frisbee.
If you do this correctly, the coin will never
flip over.
Step 4.
If your opponent is tipsy (or simply not too
bright), say quickly, “Heads I win, tails
you lose.”
Chances are he won’t catch on.
For pretty good odds, suggest to your opponent
that you spin the coin on its edge instead
of tossing it—and take tails.
A spinning coin lands on tails about 80% of
the time.
Step 5.
If you can’t master either of these techniques,
buy a trick coin with either heads or tails
on both sides.
Did you know A coin lands the same way it
started about 51% of the time.
