this is Steve Young from Gourmet
Cheesecakes this video is on Uncanny and
slicing a
cheesecake I slice my
cheesecakes with a boning knife you want
something that is nice and narrow right
here so that your cake doesn't stick to
it does not have to be very sharp but
this right here uh gives you a lot less
knife that you have to clean off and I
always bathe it in hot water so that it
just literally goes like a hot knife
through butter doing the
cake dry it I start out by releasing my
cake from the edges of the spring form
because it has a one PB sour cream
topping on it and sometimes it will tear
that topping loose if you don't release
it
first so just hold your knife in
there rotate your cake it has a paper
towel underneath the spring
form because as these things cool quite
often you get butter comes out from the
crust and it makes it very sticky on the
bottle open up your spring form some
spring forms you have to actually lift
it up and the cake comes up and the ring
ends up on your arm mine open up big
enough that I can take them off from the
top open it up give it a
shake it releases from the sides and
then walk the spring form
off then separating the cake from the
base these particular bases are rimless
bases you don't have to go down with uh
with your knife past the edge to get the
cake off I can slide right straight
across and I'm going to put it on my
cardboard base dry off your
knife Slide the knife under the cake
leave it
there lift up on the knife and slide
your base under the
knife pull the knife
out hold on to the back of the cake and
slide it onto the
base lift up your
base and you'll notice down on the paper
towel this is the butter that comes out
so it would be very hard with this thing
sticking to the countertop to actually
turn this to cut
it put your cake back
down dry off your knife now I just
eyeball this with a little bit of
practice you can tell where to cut these
it's just cut the cake in half Cut the
Cake in half cut those pieces in half
cut those pieces in half and you just
keep
going so you eyeball it start your knife
you push down on the knife right here
with your thumb while you pull down with
this
hand it hits the crust on the bottom and
then push hard cracks down through the
crust hold the edges of the cake pull
the knife out from the side put it back
in the
water turn your cake with the paper
towel dry off your
knife eyeball it again made it up with
your original
cut crack down through
it this is going to be 16 slices from
here on out I just cut every one of
these in half until I'm completely
done eyeball
it turn
it dry off your knife
crack through
it now you have four pieces and we're
going to cut each of those pieces into
four pieces and end up with 16 slices
being
careful when you're going into your hot
water that you go straight in with that
knife and straight back up you do not
want to tip this jug of water over on
top of your customer's
cake turn it
this right here a little bit that came
off the
side of the edge right here probably
from that spot right there you can just
kind of lift those off of
there this will also give you an idea
we're doing this in real time about how
long it takes to actually slice one of
these the reason for wiping off the
knife before each
cut is so that as you'll notice you get
nothing on top of your cake looks nice
and
clean you'll notice I'm putting nothing
between these slices
there's a lot of people that take these
cakes throw them up on their table and
they say that they made it themselves
they didn't buy it from anybody why
because there's
no paper dividers between the
slices and the slices don't really stick
together all that bad so you don't have
to have
those in my opinion you don't have to
have those paper dividers in there
looks tacky obviously not
homemade turn
it dry your knife
don't get uh your cake very far away
from the edge of your work surface or
you'll hit the bottom of your knife and
it you won't make it all the way through
the
cake give it a bit of a push back
together pull it to the edge don't drop
it off the
edge pick up the edge of your cake slide
your hand under it run your hand
underneath the edge of the cake wiping
off the crumbs that are sticking to the
bottom of your
base then go ahead and load it into your
box
and then just close up your box thank
you very much
