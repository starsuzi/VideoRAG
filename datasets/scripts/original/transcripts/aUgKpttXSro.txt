if you have a high aspect ratio sail let
a tall narrow sail such as this a rig on
an
IO you just about have to have panel
sails because whatever curve you indu at
the foot by the way you position the out
Hall it just won't carry very far up the
sail the Victoria rig on the other hand
is is a low aspect ratio sale which is
to say It's relatively short for the
width and quite a bit of the curvature
that you put in at the foot the way you
adjust the out hul carries out most of
the uh most of the way up the sale
that's why Victoria will do okay in most
conditions with a single panel
sail but if you want the very best you
have to go to
panels Hugh Hamilton was nice enough
years ago to allow me to copy his sale
patterns and I have that somewhere set
aside on drafting film I've transferred
it to white
paper versions you can see the overall
jib there in the
background and if you look through the
tripy laid out on the
tabletop you'll see the pattern for the
main and while I intend to
use uh tripot from that massive lifetime
supply roll in the
background because it is pretty close to
Flat uh from the uh Factory I wanted to
tell you you probably won't be buying
such a massive quantity of tripy and
it'll come in a tighter row like that
shown right next to the masking
tape and if that's the case you need to
make alternate panels with alternate
curvature and the curvature should be 4
and A2 just as indicated
here this shows you that there is curve
along the L of the
main this is intended to
match some of the curvature that will be
induced in the Mast which I'll show you
in a
minute you should be able to see that
the Mast is curved just a little bit
that's because of the moment arm between
where the back State connects at the top
of the Mast and the lower point on the
Mast where the jib stay connects this
induces a bend and your saale needs to
take that into
account this is a broad seaming tool and
I used it for a couple of years for
panel sales this is close to the
traditional way of handling handling
sails and the idea is that you you cut a
air foil shaped curve in a wide
board and then with a table saw or a
band
saw you cut it down the
middle and then taper the sides so that
you get an angle between the two
edges and the Steep of that angle along
with the curvature here determines how
much extra material goes uh goes into
the
scene I was thinking that I had a little
too much curvature so I uh reworked it
and now I don't have it nearly enough
but I don't use it that much anymore
anyway but you can uh I did it using a
router to duplicate the shape from one
board to five others the preferred way
is to have a band saw that can cut the
shape all at one time before you do the
the center
Cuts this is one of my homemade seaming
tools uh another place in the video I'll
go into some detail about how to build
one but for now let's just notice that
there is a little Gap in there between
the strip and the plank and I'm going to
use that to put a little extra material
into a panel before before I uh tape
them
together
okay with The Gap still set in
the strip I'm going
to tape this first panel
down now I'm going
to take the curve
out of the
thing
and if you have the light just
right you can see there's a little
little bit of a
wrinkle there right below the edge of
the paper where I'll be gluing
it taping it
for
[Applause]
for
and now if
[Music]
we tape the
panel like this so I can put a little
bit of
a pull on
it you can see there's just a little bit
of
curvature built into that seene by that
extra
material one curious thing about that
extra
material it doesn't really matter
whether you put it into a horizontal SL
seam a vertical seam or a seam at some
other angle this is that same two pieces
of paper taped together just cut down
now as though it was a vertical
scene and I'm going to insist whether
you can see it or not that there's a
little bit of curvature in there just
because in fact what we did is we added
some
sphericity to the
sail and it just doesn't matter that
much whether it's a vertical seam or a
diagonal seam or whatever if you want to
do a tri radial cut on a sail uh you can
do it just this way
that is I intend to use tripy for the
bottom three panels the three largest of
the
sale and I'm going to use the
polycarbonate coated rip stop
nylon for the top two
panels polycarbonate coated n uh rip
stop nylon makes decent sales it's not
my favorite material but any rata you go
to you'll probably find one or two boats
that are using it I like it for the top
two panels as accent it comes in Wild
colors it's inexpensive and fairly easy
to work
with
the seams need to be marked with some
precision and then cut
out very nicely along that straight
line other parts should be left with
extra material which you'll trim after
the sail is completely
assembled I like to use a double row of
tape sort of a belt and suspenders type
so you'll see that I have about a/ in
overlap at each
scene note that I've identified the
panel and the orientation so that I can
put the pieces together later you might
be surprised at how difficult that is if
you don't have it marked ahead of time
you also see that I've marked the seam
edges that's help me when I tape them
together otherwise the seam is the only
critical
cut uh on on all panels the bottom panel
has of course only the single
seam so all the panels for both Sails
are cut out and laid down on the table
overlapping roughly how they will be
when the seams are taped and what
remains now is to tape those
seams
after the seams are taped I'll trim both
sails to the final
size that's why the Precision on
matching the seams isn't exactly
critical it just makes me feel better to
be trying to be precise as I
go
