start with three quarters of a pound of
unsalted butter at room temperature i
need two cups of sugar
i'm just gonna cream that at medium
speed until it's really light and fluffy
okay on low speed
i'm just going to add these one at a
time until they're incorporated
okay five extra large eggs
one and a half teaspoons of vanilla
extract
turn it to low so i'm not wearing the
vanilla
one and a half teaspoons of pure almond
extract
okay now for the dry ingredients so
first i need three cups of flour
just fluff it up first
and then carefully scoop it just level
it off
i always put it through a sifter it
combines the leavening ingredients and
the flour and salt but it also makes
sure that there's no little pieces in it
one teaspoon of baking powder
half a teaspoon of baking soda
half a teaspoon of salt
just sift them all together
in a cloud flower
okay perfect
now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
pour a cup of milk
i'm going to add the milk and the dry
ingredients alternately to the batter
starting and ending with the flour
4 ounces of coconut
you can really find it in any grocery
store
just fold it in carefully
i've got two nine inch cake pans greased
and floured
half an each
okay
i'm just going to smooth this out
so these are going to bake 350 degrees
for 45 to 55 minutes
and then i'm going to do a cream cheese
frosting
yum
so the first thing i need is a pound of
cream cheese it needs to be room
temperature so you can make it nice and
smooth
half a pound of butter
it is frosting after all
i'm just to mix it together you don't
want to whip it just stir it together
i'm going to add a pound of sifted
confectioners sugar i've already sifted
this
just in some flavorings
three quarters of a teaspoon of good
vanilla extract
a quarter of a teaspoon of almond
extract
just a drop
and just mix that until it's smooth
um
this looks good
okay now i'm just gonna put it on the
cake
okay so the two cakes i'm gonna do one
upside down
so we have a flat surface for the second
cake let's put some
frosting right in the middle so i'm
gonna ice the entire cake and then we're
gonna dust the whole outside with
coconut
that's about six ounces of coconut so
all together there's about four ounces
in the cake
and six ounces on top so you need about
10 ounces of coconut
so that's a coconut cake
you
