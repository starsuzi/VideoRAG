[Music]
and just beginning to relax now
now those eyes starting to
rest those lips relaxing
shut releasing all
tension in those arms and
legs and feeling a calming
rest begin to cover that
body from head to
toe as you you let
go of all
tension and really feel it leave your
body
now feeling a soothing
relaxation at the very top of the
head almost like a warming white
light resting now
at the very top of that
head and that warming light begins to
travel down across the
face as those facial
muscles relax
now and you can really feel those
muscles release their
RI traveling down across the
neck soothing and relaxing those neck
muscles as they
release and let
go that warming light flowing across
those
shoulders as those shoulders can let go
now down those
arms as those arms become
heavy with
relaxation and that white light travels
down relaxation gently swirling around
the
Torso
warming and
resting all of those back
[Music]
muscles and that that peacefulness of
rest now allows those
hips to
relax and those legs let
go and become
heavier as they release all
tension that warm white light travels
all the way down to the toes
you may begin to
notice that the body becomes
heavy
heavier almost as
if you cannot move
it and it feels so good so
relaxed you have no
desire to move it right
now and that thinking mind mind begins
to
calm no longer fighting thoughts that
may enter
it just allowing them to
be and allowing them to slip
away into the
distance you do not need them
now and you can pick them up later if
you so
desire or just leave them there
[Music]
here and you can begin to get the
sense of Simply stepping outside of your
daily
life and allowing those days of your
life to be over
there a little distance away from
you where you can see those days clearly
and simply observe
them and you may see those
days as a continuous
line or maybe lined up side by
side however you see them it doesn't
really
[Music]
matter and just take a moment now and
look at the those
[Music]
days and notice the
details of exactly how you live the
moments of your
[Music]
life what do those days look
like from beginning to
end are they heavily jammed with
activities heavy with duties both full
of responsibilities and taking care of
the needs of
others noticing how you feel
internally as you look at these
days and noticing how you used to choose
to live them
[Music]
and now take a closer
look where in those days do you
see if
anywhere taking care of your
needs Taking Care of the need to renew
your
energy with physical exercise and rest
the requirement to feed your
spirit with motivation and
inspiration the need to just enjoy
moments of
life where are those
times in those
days can you find any
or are those 24 hours of the day given
to other
things that you thought you had to
[Music]
do is this the life you dreamed of
living is this how you desire to
continue to spend your
time or are you ready for change
[Music]
now and you can begin to
recognize the importance of keeping life
in
balance between what you do for
others and what you do do for
yourself releasing the need to do those
things that are really no longer
necessary those things that may have
been unfairly levied upon
you by a mistaken
belief that taking care of
oneself is
selfish you see everything living
element of
life from animals to trees to
people all needs to be taken care
of and to ignore your needs as a
human is to be careless and
irresponsible with this life that you
have been
gifted and you can begin to
sense that true appreciation for your
life and that desire to honor
it grows
within and you can start to feel a
shift right
now as those priorities become more
balanced
more
reasonable feeling inside the increasing
strength of that commitment to tend to
yourself in balanced
proportion to the other aspects of your
life and you feel so
comfortable as everything comes into
balance
noticing how natural this
feels and you can let go now of all that
is not yours any
longer releasing those
unnecessary
responsibilities
now feeling
lighter relieved and relaxed
[Music]
and you once again focus on those days
there in front of
you seeing them over
there and you can begin to gently
discard those activities that no longer
fit and just allow them one by one to
float out and away from those
days disappearing into the
air as you begin to get the
sense of what it is like to become
responsible only for that which is truly
yours just continuing to remove the
unnecessary
tasks from those days
now allowing others to take the
responsibilities that belong to
them knowing it both the
conscious and unconscious
level that everything will be just
fine and the world will continue in a
wonderful way
an even better
[Music]
way taking one last look to make sure
all that is unneeded floats away
now disappearing into the
past you no longer need
them and as they are disposed of you can
feel the cords that you to bind you to
those
tasks used to bind you to those thoughts
of having to do so
much you can feel those
cords being severed
now no need to hang on to them
anymore and that feels so good and so
free feeling lighter and more
relaxed than you have felt in a very
long
time and allow yourself to take a few
calming
breaths in and
out and feel a
lightness and a restful
peacefulness inside
[Music]
you have now created
space in your
life space that can be filled with
moments of
self-care with activities that better
your
mind your body and your spirit
times of
relaxation and space to Just
Breathe time to live the life that you
desire to
live feeling
happier more
fulfilled than you have felt in a long
time feeling the true freedom of this
now and what it will be like to live in
this new
way locking deeply into place this
feeling these
thoughts and this new way of
living as the Earth continues to
turn in a new and a better
[Music]
way and allow yourself now to actually
float into those
days and experience
firsthand what those days will be
like beginning
now and experiencing those days no
notice how much better you
feel how much more rewarding life
is how there is
room and space to take care of
[Music]
yourself going through those
days easily
peacefully more fulfilled than ever
before
before and completely
relaxed knowing you live your
life in
[Music]
balance and you can now
choose to either drift into a restful
Slumber or to wake up and continue with
your day
[Applause]
