hello guys
so before i
turn my music on and relax in this
beautiful hot bath that i have waiting
for me i decided to make a quick video
just to encourage you all as ladies to
take time out for yourself
a lot of times we get so bogged down
with everything in our lives that we
don't even have time to
close the bathroom door kick everyone
out and
take a nice hot bath and listen to music
and just relax and just unwind
take that time for yourself and
the first part of that sentence is like
literal
take the time for yourself you have to
take it because
if you don't then the days will just
pass by
and you just
won't ever get any time for yourself i
feel like every day we should be able to
do something for ourselves that we love
i
i keep messing with this part of my
um
of my
robe because i just don't want to be
exposed on youtube
um
anyway i wanted to come on here just to
encourage you all to take time for
yourselves you know so many times i run
into women
that just don't have and i used to be
one of them that i just didn't have time
for myself so
i went out today i went
to
a couple of stores and while i was in tj
maxx which is one of my favorite stores
in the whole world
tj maxx and target um i got the greatest
deal ever i found this
coconut and oceans mineral
um
bath salts
this stuff i've never seen a coconut
bath salt before but this stuff
it smells so good and you can i want you
guys to kind of see the texture but
it's coconut and minerals it's made by
nature
soothing relaxing bath salts they
relieve sore
muscle softened skin
so
you know whatever it takes guys i feel
like
it's so easy to create this
environment for yourself that will allow
you to meditate that will
will allow you to just think about your
day
and it's just something that we all need
so i have
candles lit i have a couple of candles i
have already
run my bath water and i've added the
bath salts
and i have on one of my favorite little
robes i have my ipad here
that
i am going to
continue after i finish talking to you
guys playing my oldies that i have
already
sometimes i like to listen to classical
music too
but i just wanted to
share this moment with you guys share
this experience with you guys you know
because it just makes your life easier
it makes you nicer when you take time
out for yourself
take time out for yourself and relax
because we deserve this we deserve this
especially when you have
well i don't want to say when you have a
hard job because any job these days is
hard you know being a stand mom
being a stay at home mom is difficult
being a health care provider is
difficult
any type of job you have is stressful
especially when you're dealing with the
public
so i just want to encourage you all to
take some time out for yourself
go out to a little store
get the things you need to create the
type of environment that will be
relaxing for you lavender is a good
choice too
it's very relaxing do that for yourself
because we're worth it so
i just wanted to share that with you all
and i will see you soon
bye
