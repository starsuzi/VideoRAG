hi there and welcome to easy everyday
solutions solutions to make your life
that much easier
do you have corrosion on your car
battery you know that white gunk all
over the place and usually around the
terminals
don't take it in and pay somebody
to have it removed you can do it easily
by yourself
this hint was given to me by a midas
mechanic so i tried it and it worked
all you need to do is heat some water up
to boiling in
a tea kettle and pour it over your car
battery
that corrosion disappears it definitely
works now don't let anybody tell you it
doesn't because
if they do chances are they're a
mechanic
and there's money to be made in it for
them just saying
