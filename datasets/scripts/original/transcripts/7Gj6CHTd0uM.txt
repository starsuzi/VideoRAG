hi guys I'm Candace and I'm Casey we're
comparing two rinses from mmob and you
won't believe what they
[Music]
are you guys may have heard a lot about
benefits of using alcohol in your hair
the B vitamins and natural proteins and
beer are supposed to strengthen your
hair and make it feel thicker and
stronger so the malose and sugar are
also supposed to be able to tighten your
hair cuticles to add shine a vodka rinse
on the other hand is supposed to be a
great clarifier the alcohol removes
products buildup and seals cuticles for
more shine we're putting these rinses to
the test so here we go all right you
guys so let's get started you're
supposed to pour the beer after you wash
and condition your hair you can do this
when it's stamped or air dried so right
now I'm going to open the
bottles all right so here we go I'm
going to go ahead and start here let me
yeah pouring the beer on my
hair
smells
it's
cold sorry a little
[Music]
more so now I'm just stamping it so that
it doesn't soak
everywhere all right my my turn so I'm
going to use the
[Music]
Vodka oh this one smells too
strong there we
go so now we're just trying to get all
around so you want to make sure it's
damped you get that vodka all in there
oh this smells so strong i' rather be
taking a shot of this than putting it in
my
hair it's
cold all right so this is not an
everyday thing
but let's see how this comes out so make
sure you have it damped in there pretty
good don't get it in my
eye all right let's try
[Music]
it doesn't feel too different right now
no feels like I just took a shower it's
a little thicker than
usual all right so we're going to go
rinse this out with water and style it
and see how it turns out so we're all
done you guys and you know what
afterwards it still feels normal I would
say um it does come out shinier but
while blow drying it I just felt like it
was like rough a little bit yeah when I
was straightening mine it did feel a
little bit greasy but definitely overall
there's a lot more shine to it yeah
there's shine in mine as well yeah a lot
more texture too so I would definitely
do it again I probably wouldn't I'm just
so used to that slick smooth fill I mean
yeah you could still run your fingers
through it but you know there is a
little bit of roughness I love the shine
so yeah maybe this is something I'll try
so one last tip don't overdo on either
of these two too much alcohol can be dry
trying at most you would only need a
clarifying treatment once or twice a
month give it a try guys and tell us how
it worked for you for all things style
