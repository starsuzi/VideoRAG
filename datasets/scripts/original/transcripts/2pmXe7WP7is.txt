so i've made the guacamole and that's
about
11 avocados to put that into freezer
baggies
so i can have it for the future yay
so i put all the avocado and individual
serving bags
and i just put about two scoops two very
big scoops
in one bag and i made it flat and i
turned it over
so the bags folded into thirds and
each one of those is probably about
three-fourths of an avocado when you
want to unfreeze it
and eat it you just pour some warm water
over the hot water or whatever
and then you can use it when you want to
use it so this is a great way
to preserve avocados
