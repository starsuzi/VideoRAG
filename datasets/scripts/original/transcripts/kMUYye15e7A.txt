okay today we're gonna clean uh
key tops um the way i do it
these these keys are out of the piano
right now i'm working on steinway
and but while you're at home this is a
quick and easy way just to
clean your key tops if you've got ivory
or plastic key tops
it's the same i just use water tap water
and uh i put a tiny little vinegar in it
just to kill a couple germs so
your key tops might smell like vinegar
for a little bit but that'll go away or
just use tap water
if you want to go as far as using
distilled water
you could use distilled water also with
the ivory so i would
i would just recommend using water or
water with a tiny little vinegar mixed
in
uh maybe uh one part vinegar to four
parts water
um so i i just i have it in a sprayer
but if you don't have a sprayer just
just you know a glass or a little uh
bucket or you know just whatever works
best for your house
and i take a paper towel um while it's
in the piano
you're gonna you're gonna wanna so i'll
just show you how i do this
i spray just a little bit on top and i
grab a whether it's a white key or a
black key
for me in your piano it's going to be
hard to get around the edges and
everything but you could still do a good
job with the tops while it's in the
keyboard
and i'm just rubbing back and forth
i know it's probably really hard to see
in the piano or seeing the camera
and these are pretty pretty scuzzy it's
been here for a long time
so i'll turn it over and i'll just i'll
just look at the rag to make sure you
know how how dirty is it how clean is
it becoming or how clean is it getting
in while it's in the panel try to get
the edges the best you can
uh you might want to push down on a key
or even pick it up a little bit if you
can
um i'm spending a lot of extra time on
these because they're out and
they're they are so dirty but when
you're doing the the top of your own
piano
um it shouldn't take you any more than
15 minutes to go through it all
and it's it's good to do once a year i
would say if you're doing it yourself
unless you want your tuner to do it your
tech um
but yeah just just water uh one thing to
note
while you're doing uh black keys in the
piano
just be real careful about how hard you
push on the sides of them
so while you're while you're tuning your
black or cleaning the black keys you're
going to want to push the white keys
down
you can kind of hold it with a finger if
you want up you'll do the top and you'll
do the sides
while you're doing the sides don't push
too hard on the sides you know you don't
want to break any of the black keys off
break the glue um uh
and that's pretty much it the ivory
sometimes don't come out so
shiny so just you know with the clean
rag if you want to try to shine you're
just gonna buff it yourself
you know and that that's it you're not
gonna add any car waxes or any kind of
waxes or uh especially on ivories with
the plastic keys you might be able to
add some
some some different cleaners but i i
just use water
so happy cleaning and uh cheers
