how come nobody puts leaves in their
hair
they put flowers in our hair
am i getting carried away now
hey fake nieces it's marisha we
literally just did two halloween videos
and now i have to slide on in to
thanksgiving four years ago when my mom
and i first started doing videos for my
channel we did a really really cool
thanksgiving dinner video which was so
so awesome it was so much fun i have to
do that video but i have to make it
better i'm going to upgrade the cupcakes
and the quality of the video it's going
to be a lot better this time so we've
got upgraded turkey with stuffing in it
we're doing the mashed potatoes and
gravy and then we're going to do another
version of the peas and carrot cupcakes
if you haven't done so yet please
subscribe to the channel and click on
that little bell so that you get
notifications or else i will get lost
all up in the sauce and let's get
started
for these tasty turkey time cupcakes
we're gonna need two frosted cupcakes
one unfrosted cupcakes along with a
cutter that's about the size of your
cupcake to cut out some fondant we're
gonna need a brown gel dye and i want to
use orange but i don't have any so i'm
going to mix red and yellow together
we're also going to need green gel dye
fondant of course we're going to need
some extra frosting on the side as well
as a little bit of caramel so let's get
started
i'm going to take a big scoopful of
vanilla frosting
and just put it right onto wow and then
it already looks like mashed potatoes
because it's not going to be perfect
it's just going to be a little bit messy
i'm going to make a little
well a little well with my gravy or
butter
[Music]
and that's the yellow which looks like
brown
it's buttercup yellow it's very
golden-ish when mommy rolls out the
butter i have some caramel sauce and i
love it because it's so thick it looks
like gravy
you're making butter for the family
nice incredible nice
mashed potatoes on a cupcake eat it
let's move on to the carrots so we're
going to make two shades of orange
so you know how the inside of the carrot
is that's the perfect color for carrots
so this is going to be the center and
that's going to be the outside of the
carrot
so i'm going to roll this out
place the lighter color on the inside
and then wrap it around
and then
roll all this together i'm going to cut
it like i would carrots have little
grooves in them don't they
well yeah they have
i'm making carrots they're not perfectly
smooth look at that yeah no that's
secure that's a carrot
look at these beautiful peas that mommy
made her hands her fingers are still
green
and you worked hard i did so now we can
begin to put all of these peas and
carrots onto our cupcake
or i guess we could put the carrots on
and then whenever there's like a little
space
yeah what kind of pee did i make
i'm gonna take some corn syrup and i'm
going to lightly brush all of these
carrots okay orange petal dust
just to see what it'll look like painted
onto
the carrots i like to glaze my carrots
with thyme
yeah now you're talking i know and
butter just got serious with it and
just normal
granulated sugar yeah a pinch of salt
you're gonna have a fun time
is this brown enough
no that looks like a turkey that's only
been in for like two hours right but now
it has to go in for that last two
putting that right on top and just going
to smooth it out
once i have the cupcake covered i'm
going to pick the top of it and i'm
going to make a little indent
and now we're going to make our legs
carefully roll it into a cone
that looks really good
and now to make the wings you pretty
much start off
by making the leg and then we just make
the flat side
and then you just bend it upwards
and they're going to go with the thinner
side facing
upwards
this looks like a full turkey sure does
we're going to glaze this bad boy
because it just came out of the oven and
it's almost time for us to carve into a
little water with a little teeny bit of
corn syrup makes for the perfect glaze
[Music]
and then we can even do a little bit of
stuffing with a cereal oatmeal cluster
if you'd like that's perfect and that's
our stuffed turkey and that's our whole
thanksgiving dinner we hope that you
guys enjoyed this video

lovely
thankful and delicious thanksgiving
