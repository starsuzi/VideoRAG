hi welcome to my channel ruia stman in
this video I want to teach you how to
knit this beautiful cable hat it's more
like a slouchy it's very easy to do and
hope you guys like it and give it a try
and here is the listing material you're
going to need to make
it to make this hat I'm going to use
Lion Brand jarn well easy
Tel um it have 113 G it's bulky 5 and is
80% acrylic and 20% wool and the color
is
aqua The netting needle or the circular
needle and they are 8 mm and the
measurement of the cable is 22
cm I going to use a pom pom that I
bought at
Michaels and
I found these ones too at the dollar
store for a125 they are the Lion Brand
jarn as well but they are different
color I have this one in blue I have
hadot pink and purple but the whites I
bought a Michael and they are
$4.99 so you're going to need a marker
tapestry needle and scissor a cable
needle and a piece of paper and Pen to
keep track of your rows to start we have
to leave a tail long enough enough for
casting on our stitches and we're going
to cast on 60 stitches so you're going
to wrap your yarn on your needle 30
time and once you have the 30 time
you'll pull the yarn from the
needle fold it in
half and leave a little extra tail for
casting on the 60
stitches here I have a tail long enough
for casting on
so I'm going to do a slip
knot pass through my needle this is an
adult size hat if you want a little bit
smaller I recommend a size seven netting
needle or a size six 6.5 but
smaller so you're going to cast
done you 60 stitches nice and loose
ni
so here I have my 60 stitches and I'm
going to do a knot here so we are ready
to make our H and you have to make sure
that this
border is in the center like this and
it's not
Twisted because if it's twisted like
this and you start working it will be
twisted at the
end so you have to make sure that in the
inside like
so we're going to start with the border
of the hat and we're going to start in
the first Stitch with the net and we're
going to grab the two Str of yard and
we're going to net the first one now you
let go to the
tail and grab the St jar and you net the
second
one then you Purl the next
two and then you net
two and this is the repetition that
we're going to do for the
Border two net
and two
Pearl so we'll finish
here when you do the two Pearl here and
the next one will be this two Str jar
where the tail is and there we place the
marker because that's the end of each
row so you're going to continue with two
net two Pearl I finished my first row
and I'm going to place the marker and
I'm going to mark that I did my first
row
so now I have these two strand of yarn
and you're going to
do one net and that
one and then a net in the next one so
you're going to do the same repetition
two net and two
Pearl and you're going to do
this for seven row here my yarn is open
there we go for seven rows or you can do
seven it's up to you
I finished with my seven rows and I look
small but this stretch a
lot so now we're going to start with row
number one of the design and the good
thing about working with circular needle
is the same repetition you don't change
the repetition so the only thing that
change is when you do the cable
everything now stay the
same so we're going to start with two
Pearl and this is row number one of the
design now we're going to do a net and
that's for the
cable
one
2
3

three and four now we're going to do
eight Nets and that's the repetition
four Pearl and a
Nets two
3
4

2 3
and four and now again eight Nets so
you're going to continue doing this uh
four P pearls and eight nets all the way
around and you're going to finish here
with two pearls you start with two and
you finish with two and those are the
four that you need for uh the space in
between each cable I'm going to finish
row number
one with two Pearl you see I start with
two Pearl and finish with two
pearls now you pass you mark it to the
other side Mark that you did row number
one and you're going to do exactly the
same
repetition two
pearls and two and a
Nets
1

4 5
6
7 and eight now we're going to do four
pearls
one
2
3 and four and now eight Nets you're
going to continue doing this repetition
exactly like the first row all the way
around you're going to finish with two
pearls row and you're going to repeat
this twice more for a total of four row
and in row number five we're going to do
our first row of C I finished row number
four now for row number five we're going
to do two
Pearl and now we're going to do our
first cable so this is a stitches cable
so you have to divide it in four you're
going to grab your first four
stitches pass to the back and then net
the other
four
one
2
3 and four and now I going to knit these
four and don't matter that this is a
small uh cable
needle you are not uh because these are
loose in here you are not uh making
these smaller or anything they stay the
same
size so you're want to do
one
[Music]
2
3 and
four and you do the first
cable now you're going to bring your
yard to the front and do your four
pearls
one
2
3 and
four yarn to the back and grab your
cable needle and separate your four
stitches and if you start doing the
cable to the back you only have to bring
them to the back
so you're going to knit the other
four
one
2
3 and four and then net the other four
in here in the
back
one 2
three and
four this is the repetition that you're
going to do don't seem like much right
now but once you start working you will
see the beautiful cable and you're going
to continue with your four Pearl and
then doing the cable all the way
around so I finished roll number five
now for row number six is exactly the
same
repetition for every single
row two
Pearl a
net
1
2
3
4
5
6
7 and eight and four Pearl so you're
going to continue doing this
repetition until row 14 and row 15 we're
going to do the cable
again I'm working row number nine you
see you can see the cables now the cross
the crossing at the cable
here so like you see it's very
easy so a lot of people get intimidated
by um cable netting I
was when I don't knew how
to and I give it a try and it I was fine
I was fine and uh I really enjoyed I try
once I never forgot it's like riding a
bicycle once you
learn it's always there
I finished row uh 14 it look like this
now in row 15 we're going to do the
cable again now in row 15 we're going to
do exactly the
same we're going to do two
Pearl and now with the cable needle
we're going to do the first cable
we're going to grab our first four
stitches two three and four we're going
to pass them to the
back and we're going to net the other
four
one
2 3
and four and now we're going to do the
other four on the cable
needle after that you will do your four
pearls and then another cable and so on
until you finish this
row
for for
so as you see this is a very easy uh
work to do you're going to continue with
this repetition all the way around to
the end of this
row
for for
here I finished row 15 so I'm going to
continue with the same repetition and
I'm going to do the cable and row 25 and
35 for this
one because my older daughter wanted
like more like a
slouchy this one that I made here is
exactly the same just different color
but I did one last um crossing of the
cable here this one was in row five 15
and 25 for this one will be 35 a little
bit longer so for this one I did um the
cable and then I work into row
28 and then 29 and 30 was decrease and
then I just closed the to but the cable
look
amazing and um like and then for this
one will be like 78 row here my 37 row
now we're going to decrease as we see
the Stitch so these two are Pearl so
you're going to do two Pearl
together and these are net you're going
to do two net
together two net
together and you're want to continue
doing
this in every single stitch two together
two together as you see them and then
the next row you're going to do another
decrease so when you finish in this one
you will have 30 and in next one in the
next one you will have 15 and then we
just have to uh cast off with um or
needle pass it through all and close I
did my first row of decrease so in this
one uh these two are the ones that
supposed to go together but they're in
opposite and of the needle so what I
going to do I going to do this one just
one per
and then I'm going to decrease these as
you see them two net
together and two net
together and then two pearls together
and you're going to continue all the way
around and I'll meet you here to show
you how we're going to decrease in those
two at the end now I got to the end I
have this one here and the marker what
I'm going to do is pass this one here
remove the marker put them back and do
uh these two in a pearl
stitch and you decrease last two now
you're going to cut this St long enough
to pass it through here twice and to
tight it in the inside and loose that
tail and then do the same with the this
one here and then just to put the pump p
now with the tapestry needle you're
going to pass them through those 15
stitches twice I always like to pass it
twice because I like this part to be
nice and secure
and then after that you will pass your
uh needle to the
inside uh secure your tail and then lose
whatever you have left and do the same
at the end
[Applause]
[Applause]
for
for
for for
here at the beginning you always get
these
uneven so with that tail you even it
up until it's nice and
straight and then you lose that tail in
the
inside this is what I have left from the
113 G so I use a little less than 100 G
for her hat now I going to grab my
pomone I'm going to remove from here and
pass it through here through the top and
secure it here and I will show you the
end result well this is the end result
