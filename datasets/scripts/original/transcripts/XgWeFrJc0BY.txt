hello this is L candy doing a side
experiment we're doing a volcano and
it's going to blod up at the end so make
sure you're staying tuned yeah hey it's
candy welcome back to my channel it's a
little chaotic here I'm at my sister's
house and this is my nephew Logan this
little head right here that you can see
just a little bit of is landing Logan
how old are you six Logan is six he's in
kindergarten and we thought we'd do a
little science experiment
today okay so what you'll need for this
experiment are plastic
bottles
balloons baking
soda and
vinegar Randy you have to be
quiet okay
and later on today we're going to BL
blow balloons and do a balloon challenge
where we where we pop balloons and make
sure you stay
tuned please please redo that crisy sure
okay okay make you're staying tuned of
thato okay so the first step is we're
going to take this funnel and we're
going to take the balloon and put the
balloon around the funnel now this is a
pretty big funnel
but it works okay this is actually to
fill like a water bottle or
[Music]
something you take the baking
soda and you put about a tablespoon
tablespoon and a half just some okay and
you fill the balloon take it off you all
right M okay maybe you should stop
blowing up the balloon for a
moment I'm just starting the next hey
guys this is the last is the last video
but you'll see more christe than
me but some days you will see me and
Christy doing the be but stay tuned of
that blue one it's pretty amazing we
have to blow them up and pop them it's
pretty amazing we haven't done it yet
pretty amazing but pencils and who pops
the most you are so rude get the get the
donut yeah who pass oh and the other
nephews here oh my gosh this vinegar
stinks see there's my
sister okay now we're back we have the
two
bottles a little bit now let's put in
the big no no no no
no
okay let's start with a small bottle
where's mine at No don't touch those
guys cuz they have the baking soda in
them okay so we're going to
pour just a little bit in the bottom
of the bottle so we've just put this
much in the bottom of the bottle and we
can watch it okay now we can watch our
video what we're going to do so we're
going to take the Yellow Balloon we're
going to put it over the top and the
baking soda is right here it's okay LIF
it up you want to do that you ready you
lift it up and you put
oh look at it it's blowing up the
balloon
you what happened so the chemical
reaction with the vinegar and the baking
soda produces a gas which fills the
balloon we're going to take it off of
there and we're going to do the other
one hold on it's not going to work
again so that one filled up that
much oh gosh you're not making a mess
are you no okay now
now we do the big bottle wait we got to
put the vinegar in first remember okay
now we're doing the big
[Laughter]
bottle all right so oh crap uhoh spill
sh don't tell your mom and dad get tow
you get a paper towel for me don't don't
don't do it that hey do this still don't
don't do the red one you want to do the
red one yeah
okay okay so this time we filled it more
yeah really you got it over the top hold
on it's got to be sealed christe's doing
it okay
ready oh oh
oh oh it's blowing up big look at
it I don't think we'll use it any
who we have feel more free out free
more can I stick it with a a pen no no
we're like recording oh you are yeah now
let's do the other one okay so that one
blew up way bigger huh mhm good I didn't
see what
I'm yeah you
know okay so that one we got that
big but how now what we should do with
these threee left I wonder if we have to
put more in here or if we can just put
more baking soda in yeah let's should we
do that experiment more baking soda and
then let's do more in the little bottle
so and then we'll do these
two we'll do these two in the and we'll
put this more in there and then put more
B so remember that we have to put this
over the top so it
seals
okay wo ah did you see that it's getting
bigger hey everybody look at how far it
went up the bottle that
time so it still works so the the
vinegar is still active which is good
yeah let's do the last one the pink
one oh man it's went down
again where' the red balloon go red
balloon
[Music]
bye hold on hold on hold
on okay it's fine I just wondered where
it
went all right hey
YouTubers what's Happ okay let's put so
the third time the reaction was not as
good so probably what happened is the
vinegar and the baking soda the V the
baking soda has kind of dyed the vinegar
down so let's try the small bottle let's
put more bigger in the little bottle and
then put it and then put this in I
agree and maybe I could beat it hold on
are you in Fr and there we go next we're
doing
painting so watch out
YouTubers this is
awesome put up higher higher
wow on this okay let's put the green one
on see let me do let me pour it in this
okay you pour
it mommy me pour it a I sorry ly I'll
let you do it next
time the little bottle is very
disappointing yeah YouTu first never use
little Bott all the big love bottles use
the big bottles yeah
all right so bye
