so first we're going to marinate our
pork
i'm using a little bit of lemon pepper
adobo from goya and complete seasoning
before i marinate all my meat just to
save time i preheat my
burner to low i don't like to put it on
medium because if you put it on medium
it could cook the meat too fast and you
don't want to burn kind of a flavor you
want the seasoning flavors
so being that this has to be cooked on
low
you need a lot of time to
cook
you can't do this as a last minute kind
of a meal with rice on the side
it does take a while to do
i use coconut oil to fry but you can use
vegetable oil if you'd like to
um and i just put in about enough that i
would have 50
of the meat covered you don't need that
much
once you see the rusted or orangey kind
of look that's when you know it's ready
to be flipped over
and just to add more crisp i put it in
the toaster oven at 300 degrees for
about four minutes and then
this is what it looks like when it's
done
