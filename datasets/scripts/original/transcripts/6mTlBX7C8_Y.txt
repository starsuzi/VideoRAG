hey hey
welcome to bonsai bonsai
today
we have
this is our asparagus fur
[Music]
this is our asparagus fern it's well not
a true
tree in the sense of the word tree
it's one of my bonsai bonsai collection
members
um
as you can see
shaped it up
i've got it in a training pot
actually it's an old bowl
that i think has some noodles or
something in it
but it looked like a bonsai pot so i've
had this plant in there for almost a
year
so i've trimmed it up put it outside for
the summer it's thrown up quite a bit
quite a bit of growth
part of my uh
other plant bell in there
i kind of like that
gives it a little bit of
sense of a forest that's what this theme
is supposed to be this is a forest
a little clump of forest
little trees
there's some leaf litter
among the rocks
i had some moss growing here but it all
dried out and died but this plant's been
doing pretty good
um i leave it outside for a few days at
a time and bring it in kind of
trim it back a little bit
so yeah
this is our asparagus fern
it's kind of a slow grower doesn't do
too much but it's pleasing to look at
and
gets a nice
the foliage on it is really nice and
feathery it's really beautiful to look
at
um
so i imagine when i bring it back in for
the end of the
warm weather growing
season probably going to explode again
in growth be pretty interesting so i
trimmed it back a little bit
let's put out some grow
i like it
it's aesthetically pleasing
to the eye
but yeah
bonsai
