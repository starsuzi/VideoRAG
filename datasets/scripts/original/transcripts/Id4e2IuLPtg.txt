hey everyone
um the video today isn't really going to
be long it's just a suggestion for
people who use ribbon
um whether it's to make hair bows or
shoelaces or whatever
um a lot of people have trouble with
when they cut the edge of their ribbon
whatever way they want it whether it's
angled or straighter
um
just whatever way they want it they have
problem with the ribbon uh unraveling or
running Coming Undone or fraying
whatever you choose to call it
um
they have this stuff at Walmart that you
can use to stop this it's like two
dollars and something
um it's bodrits and this is what it
looks like it's going to come with the
cap that you screw on that looks like
this
and the box that comes in
is pink and white it says uh
dritz and stop fraying ribbon
but um the directions are on the back
but something some people don't read
directions before they do it and I'm one
thing that people do with this uh
is they get scissors and they want to
cut the nozzle right here don't use
scissors to do that you want to use a
straight pin
um or sewing sewing needle but you just
want to stick it through the top and
puncture push it all the way down until
it gets to where
right there and you'll see some come out
it'll push a little out when you get
done
but make sure to use a straight pin to
open this do not use scissors because
too much will come out
um
then just screw the head on
and
if you don't want to use this to stop
your Ribbon from unraveling
another thing people use is they use
Clear fingernail polish whatever brand
you want
um you just dab it on them along the
edge on both sides just make sure it
covers it and that can stop it or you
can use a lighter
um lighters don't work for all ribbons
like some that are made like with the
harder coating they're stiffer ribbons
they're not flexible flexible like this
um they have like hard plastic on it or
something
but yeah lighter will not work on those
um so you'll either have to use the
clear fingernail polish
or this which you can get at Walmart
um
one of the Walmarts near me has a a
fairly huge Craft section so I can find
lots of cool stuff like this
so um just put the edge of your Ribbon
in the little like indention in this
nozzle and just barely squeeze the
nozzle make sure that you have
this um bottom part like when you turn
it upside down make sure that's on the
bottom so it can catch whatever comes
out but don't squeeze
the bottle too hard
just to run it along the edge
and then you're gonna have to wait for
it to dry I don't know if you can see
the how it's wet right there
it kind of smells like fingernail polish
remover but yeah
I think I put a little bit too much but
it'll be fine because when it draws it
perfect so it's basically like putting a
clear fingernail polish but you just
don't have the brush you just have the
nozzle and you squeeze it on and it
covers it itself
so um
you can probably see where it ran down
on the white side better but yeah make
sure to wash your hands when you get
through using this stuff
and make sure it draws before you go
laying it everywhere
and when you unscrew this cap off
make sure that you
um
take it to a sink and rinse it out real
good to get all the the fraying liquid
out of the nozzle and then put the other
the closed nozzle back on it and then
just storm wherever you want to so yeah
that's basically it just a good tip for
whoever has trouble
you know with their ribbon and they want
something that they can
purchase that will help their ribbon
from unraveling
so I hope y'all found this video you
know a little helpful
and I hope you all subscribe to my
channel thanks for watching
um one other thing I forgot to say
actually before in this video is
um I meant to show y'all when I was
cleaning it I don't know if y'all can
see I've been there but when you clean
it with
cold water it may do it with warm water
too I haven't done it with warm water
um you'll see like this film that looks
kind of like paste or glue I forgot to
tell you you can't just rinse it out you
need to take a paper towel or Q-tip
whatever you choose to clean it with and
just make sure that you you know
get everything out of there I forgot
rinsing I don't like I said I don't know
you can try warmer hot water
um I haven't really used this much yet
so um just make sure also to run it if
you use cold water run it in between
right there
um where the I guess you could say
nozzle of it is and just make sure to
get that film off like I said it just
looks like glue or paste or whatever so
um yeah it's it's really quick and easy
to clean
um
but just make sure to that so this stays
clean so yeah that's also a good tip
again thanks for watching
