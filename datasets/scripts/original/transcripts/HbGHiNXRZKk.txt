hey
there okay to start with what you want
to do is put a quick link through a
pulley uh carabiners will work fine but
quick links are cheaper and stronger
then you put a rope through your pulley
now you want to tie the end of that rope
onto a
carabiner that way you can clip it
around a tree real
fast so now you've got a pulley on a
rope with a quick link on the pulley now
to pull that up the hill you need to tie
a carab on the end of a pull rope
and then you clip that pull rope onto
your quick link if you're going to do
some tires you're going to want to
prepare uh like a 5-ft piece of chain or
a rope and put carabiners on the end of
that and get ready to take that out okay
now outside you take your little
assembly clip it around a tree just that
easy got your pulley on your
rope walk that up your Hill okay then
you take your rope make a little loose
tie that loop around your tree then you
have a pulley a quick link and a
carabiner on a
rope so what you want to do is take your
pull
rope clip that onto your quick
link now you're ready to pull anything
up the hill that you can snap onto that
Carabiner like a tire so you just take
your chain put it through your tire clip
it to
itself then you clip that onto your your
main
Carabiner it's
easy then you have uh everything ready
to be pulled up the hill with a trash
bag just tie a square
knot and then take yourself a carabiner
and clip it right around your tie clip
that onto your main Carabiner and then
you can pull that up the hill or you can
pull up buckets or mesh bags you can tie
up Lumber and clip it on you can do
tarps it's just a lot easier to clean up
a park if you got a pulley on a
rope there you have the pulley system
for cleaning up parks
