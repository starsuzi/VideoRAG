now odors I had four to one one day well
with a place nothing around here show
you how to pickle some pig feet where
guys are Joey okay and I put some up
that's hot stuff
it's a hot pepper extract I mean it's
like five million Scoville units hot for
a whole painter is 200,000 so I tell you
how hot daddy let's put one drop I'm
gonna do take a pig feet it's all in
half long waist right between the two
front toads slide that in there this
locks up pretty simple pretty easy
I'm gonna take the other half and slide
it over the other side up with the both
open sides to each other they're a
little bit long so it'd be alright
and then I say I can't get to in a cold
jar so we're going to go some big ears
salyers a whole bleeder
now so far as the delicious first I bowl
this because it is pork if you can pull
if you can't pork
you got a cooking first cuz it swell up
bust the jar and pop the lid up I got
some pig ears here already cut up to
feel the bullet lessons delicious stuff
take a pig ear real chili - you want the
cartilage on the chicken wing or that
piece at the end of a chicken breast
our chicken back feel like Pig here plus
being pickle he's pretty good seasoned
green beans with tea water it really
isn't all trying to pack it pretty tight
and I'm gonna put about two teaspoons
salt to a plain salt so I'm like having
two tablespoons that much as you like
hi then I'm going to take this right
here just wet right because the pork is
a little sticky you want to make sure
that bleed that rain right there is good
or the mouth is good and clean and now
I'm just going for a lot better and just
fielder up nothing else just something
bigger if you want to add a spices and
colors and all that stuff go right ahead
can't got to me is whatever flavor you
like it go cilantro in it
make some chive put some onions carrots
enter with it too all right now let's
put a lid on it old pig ears and pig
feet I want pig snout they'd have none
it's big demand for pixmap these days
try to shake at it that
as all the nerve vinegar pop stuff
Bell Rock I never come here to the
cutter already already had a six six
cohorts applying this home to got enough
air for five year old court where's your
dog over time I think crop it

smaller cooker sighs I know I got six
coats in this pot we can't turn the
camera around here look so good time
oh yeah I got turn that thing right over
here to the canner here sit down a
little bit about that right there that
all right all right a whole lot fire I'm
not gonna pressure cook these come I am
just giggling when you pickle you don't
you don't high-pressure good I want to
do is just get the vinegar hot
sit down over boxes whispering watch
them make sure your face go I'll just
pull these once it starts to fall for
about 30 minutes
