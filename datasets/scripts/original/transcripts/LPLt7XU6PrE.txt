going to be baking up a marble cake
today now what we're going to do is make
up a sponge mix Vina sponge mix and then
separate it into two add some cocoa
powder in one side and then it sort of
gives it a lovely chocolatey mixture and
on the other side you've got a vanilla
flavor so what you then do is put some
good siiz splodges in your baking tin
give it a swirl around with a knife or a
cocktail stick and you get these really
nice sweeps of sort of chocolate running
through it give it a lovely marbly
effect and when you bite into it oh it's
delicious cup of tea can't go wrong so
just to go through the ingredients now
I've got some self-raising flour there
I've got 225 g 225 g of Casta sugar and
again 225 g of butter normally when you
buy your blocks of butter about 250 g so
you can slice just a little bit off the
end three
tablespoons of milk 2 tbspoon of cocoa
powder I'm going to use use four medium
siiz eggs and then I've got some vanilla
extract I'm going to use about 1 to 1
and 1/2 tpoon of vanilla extract so now
we've gone through the ingredients I'm
going to move it all back get myself a
bowl and we're going to start making up
the cake mixture now I've got myself a
bowl and what we're going to do is start
making up this cake mixture very simple
now you can either do it by hand or if
you got electric mixer obviously use
that cuz it keeps your life easy now the
ingredients order are going to be the
same whether you're doing it electric
mixer or by hand the only thing you want
to make sure if you're doing it by hand
is that first of all when you put your
butter and sugar you really kind of beat
it and get it sort of well mixed up
together and then obviously you start
adding your eggs one at a time mix it up
get it Incorporated and then finally
when you add your flour again a little
bit at a time you actually kind of fold
it in just to keep a bit of air in there
so if you're doing it by hand same order
but just make sure it's all nicely mixed
properly if you do it electric mix
life is easy now we're going to start
off with the butter now I did chop a
little piece off the end so we got the
right amount of butter use the butter at
room temperature cuz it just makes it a
lot easier whether you're mixing by hand
or an electric mixer so put the batter
in there now what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to
start by blending the
batter just try and get it fairly nice
and creamy
and then we can add in the
sugar I mean obviously you could add the
sugar straight in and just keep mixing
but let's just do it like
this so I'll keep mixing these two
together probably for you
know a minute or two until it's really
looking nice and creamy
so I've been giving that a good mix for
a minute or two
really so let's just switch that off the
next of all I'm going to add in the eggs
now again I'm going to keep the machine
on and I'm going to put one egg in at a
time so when that one's you know all
fully sort of mixed together
incorporated then you can add an another
egg
that's it add another one
now just carry on doing that with all
four
eggs there we go got the four eggs in
there I'm just going to add a little bit
of vanilla
extract just going
to just going to put about a teaspoon
teaspoon a little bit then I've got a
little bit of milk so might put that in
there now I'm going to start I'm going
to start whisking that again with the
machine just to get that all
Incorporated and then I'm just going to
add the flour in
there now again the flour just going to
add a little bit of a time so put a bit
in get it mixed up
then you can add some more and just
carry on doing that until you got all
the flour nicely mixed
up now I've got all the flour in there
and to be honest I've been mixing this
for at least a minute once I got all the
flour in there cuz I just want to make
sure it's really nicely mixed
up so let's just take that
off so now we finished mixing
that look at that lovely sort mixture
there nice and creamy now what I'm going
to do is to sort of separate it into two
bowls so going to get myself another
little
bowl and you can put roughly
half what I tend to do is to maybe
use just slightly more in one bowl than
the other now with this side we're going
to
add that cocoa powder and we're just
going to Again mix that up and the other
side you can leave as it is now with
this one I'm just going to use a fork
just very quickly kind of mix
it there you
go I think we got that all nicely mixed
so now I've got a mixture in two
different bowls chocolate this side
vanilla outside let's move the bowls
back and I'm going to get a baking tin
and we're going to start preparing this
marble cake now I've got all cake tin
there now I really like this one because
it's got like a false bottom so it's
easy to get your cake out
so let's just put that in now I've also
got a bit of this sort of baking P paper
or parchment paper silicon paper
whatever you've got and that will just
help to prevent it from sticking to the
bottom now I'm going to use a little bit
of butter on the packaging there and I'm
just going to really wrap that all the
way around and along the bottom right
around the
edges and just get it all over really
cuz what we don't want to do is we have
the
cake sticking to the sides or around the
bottom a little bit then next of all we
can get that cake mixture obviously we
got some that's like vanilla flavor so I
think we're just going to put some
splodes of
vanilla and then let's get some of
that chocolate
one and just use all the cake mixture up
really use the last little bit out
there now what I'm going to use for
mixing this around
now is a knife just going to kind
of swirl it around a little
bit like that you don't want to go
overboard otherwise you get too much you
know where it all mixes
together I'm just going to flatten very
slightly
the the top of
this try and push it down a little
[Music]
bit get rid of the air get give it a
quick
shake this helps the you know release
any air at the
bottom that do just going to lift mine
up put it on a baking tray just keep
things nice and simple to get in and out
of the oven now let's switch the oven on
and get it preheated so I've switched
the oven on and I've left mine to come
up to temperature so it's preheated now
temperature- wise I'm going to be
cooking this cake at 180Â° C 350 F gas
Mark 4 for around about 40 to 45 minutes
now I've been baking my cake for 45
minutes so let's just pull it out a
little bit and we're going to test it
just sck like a skewer in and see if
it's clean if you haven't got a skewer
stick a knife in I reckon that's
done looks good anyway smells beautiful
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
put mine on the table let it cool
down and then we're going to try some
now I've left me cake for about 20
minutes still a little bit warm but
let's go for it can't wait any longer
let's push that
out there's the cake looks beautiful so
let's put it on a plate slice it up and
see how it is inside now I've got me cup
of tea all already tea and Cake can't go
wrong just turn it around a little bit
look at that that looks beautiful now
I'm going to slice me cake up then
normally I cut little triangles have a
piece each but what I'm going to do
today is I'm actually going to slice
it lengthwise cuz just want to look at
this marbly effect I I say this is still
really soft soft so you do need to be
gentle with
it what I think I'll do is I'll get
another plate and I'll just lay it out
so you can see the marbly effect in
there W really soft piece of cake
there look at that oh they look good
absolutely beautiful
cake got to be careful with
it oh that's
hot also
I did make one that I cut in little
triangles
so I can just sort of like fill this up
a little bit
more there you go plenty of cake for
everyone I'm grab it of my nice cup of
tea oh be delici let's try a
bit I think I'm going to have this oh a
bit in the middle there look oh you can
see how soft it is very moist and
beautiful and you got this sort of
marbly effect and chunky bits of
chocolate cake this is going to be good
let me try
it

even dunk it in your tea or your coffee
