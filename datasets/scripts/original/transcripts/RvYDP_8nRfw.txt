hello my friends cheeks here
now i don't know if it's trending but
everyone's got these funky
steel stainless steel water bottles they
come in a lot of different companies are
making them
and just as an added twist here's a
plastic water bottle that i had
from uh contigo i did review on the
plastic
water bottles i got these at costco
check out the video
i just wanted to show you the difference
of how people are
changing as we go everything's always
changing
what are these things i don't know
stainless steel who would have thought
but you see more and more people using
these now i got a couple different
companies this one is called pure
bought that at giant tiger about 12.99
we have this one here it's called raw
steel
and this was uh you know around
15 20 dollars and we have
mana got these at canadian tire and
check out me and joy were out uh looking
for these they were on sale so we headed
over to canadian tire
so we're gonna go check out canadian
tire they actually have a sale on with
them right now
we got like three in the house right now
we want to pick up another one and
they're on sale for only
ten dollars now that's a steal
and there's uh joey joey's interested in
getting one of these bottles
you want a bottle i wanna buy a
waterfall see look he's got plastic
and this one's sick and tired of these
yeah he's in the car
it warms up all day yeah and these water
bottles you've seen it and how cold it
is
or have you seen them when they're cold
yeah yeah it's crazy you put like an ice
cube in this and the whole day that's
going to stay totally cold
let's go check it out and try to find
one maybe they're all gone
but my wife wants a gold one so i'm
trying to find a gold one
no where yeah where would they be
probably
as soon as you walk in awesome well
there you go
yeah those are the big ones now that's a
super duty one yeah i think i'm gonna
get a big one
that's 25 or the 17 ounce is what
everyone's buying is a 17 ounce one
that's what everybody's buying yeah
everyone's buying that one so that's
bigger than the ones so look if you
carry around this water bottle and
that's 500 mils
so that's a little even bigger than this
yeah
so convenience wise this is the best buy
yeah i guess it is yeah that's probably
yeah grab one
no i don't know if there are any gold
ones there's one gold
one gold one we can have the gold one
all right
there you go lee she had to have goals
right i would think she'd want pink or
something
so now we're trying to figure out what
makes these so cool like what does make
these so cool
are they double lined i think it does
say
that it is double walled yeah double
wall
double walled yeah it shows right there
double walled
okay so that's the key for these now is
that aluminum or stainless steel look at
it
says regular 39.99 10
bucks stainless steel it is stainless
steel yeah
there you go so i guess for sanitary
reasons it's easy to clean i hear
stainless steel is good right oh yeah
like even people military use this metal
absolutely yeah
yeah and we're trying to ditch plastic
right we want to get right we talked
about this before getting rid of plastic
because it ends up everywhere in the
environment the ocean yeah we talked
about that yeah we talked about it in a
good guy's show we talked about getting
rid of plastic
it's like a brushed brush light kind of
gold like a
kind of thing so this is
yeah so that's probably like three maybe
two and a half cups
probably this is about 700 mil probably
it says puddle-free leak-proof lid
sweat resistant and it's double wall
insulated so there you have it
mana joey's a believer
he's switching look he's excited too
look he's excited
and he actually needs one because he's
going to a tournament or something
yeah okay
all right i'm still videoing i gotta
cancel off
oh no it's still recording
you know i gotta hang up okay catch you
later everybody
so what makes these so special well this
one here
mana it says 17 ounce vogue bottle
bpa and lead free it says it's puddle
free
double wall insulated sweat resistant so
that's this anti-condensation they talk
about on the outside so it's like that
sweat feeling because of the stainless
steel
and it says a leak proof lid now a lot
of these that people are getting
and there's different types of water
bottles some people have had some good
luck with these that they say they keep
things cold for like 12 hours or 24
hours
or whatever the time is as long as it
keeps it cool for a reasonable amount of
time
we're all happy this one says it'll keep
it cold for 24 hours
and it's because of it how does it keep
it cool it's a double wall
insulation in these so that's what's
keeping it cold i've also seen even
triple insulated stainless steel water
bottles
so there you have it with different
those different types it also says here
for 12 hours it'll keep your
beverages hot so now
we get a little test with these i put
two ice cubes in these so i'm just gonna
try them out it's been
about six hours right now i couldn't
wait any longer
so i left these outside and it was
getting actually dark so
my temperature would drop okay everybody
here it is
i put them all in the backyard here
where the sun is
and it's basically about 20 degrees
right now outside 19
and oh and there's our old friend the
contigo two ice cubes 500 mils as well
we'll leave them here and we will be
back to see how cold it
keeps so i had to try these the mana
these are the two manas
i just was curious to see if there's any
difference on on them so you probably
have a similar water bottle like this
let me just try it now
it's cold not crazy cold but it's cold
let's try the next one
pretty much the same
yep those two are identical let's go to
the raw steel
same temperature as these ones now let's
try the pure
yeah this one's pretty much the same
actually these are colder than this one
for some reason
it's getting crazy
these ones so far feel the coldest and
then this one and then this one
so i definitely can feel this one's a
little warmer than these and these were
quite
similar and i said this is uh the
contigo
and it has really no insulation so you
really got to keep this one with full of
ice cubes because there's really no
insulation in these
so you be the judge people thank you
guys for watching
take care everybody live life loud
cheers and cheeks out
what do you think fuzzy
