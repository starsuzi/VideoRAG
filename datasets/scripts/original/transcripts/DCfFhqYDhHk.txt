but first of all will I want you to
thinly slice these if you can do those
about sort of four of these all butter
quants for
this now the custard is vitally
important this is where the recipe
really does change I'm actually going to
use milk and cream which is a standard
mixture in bread and butter pudding but
it's the addition of the white chocolate
and whiskey that really gives it its
flavor but 500 M of
milk and 500 M of double cream full fat
milk full fat cream so if you're into
low food switch off now because it's
going to get a lot worse so we just warm
this up fresh vanilla pod split it down
the middle throw it straight into the
pan just gently warm that up so the
vanilla infuses what I want you to do
now is just layer these now just take a
touch of butter just melt this in a
pan that was great so you can get me
five egg yolks and three whole
eggs use white chocolate can chop this
up
so taking some butter even though
they're all butter cant I'm still going
to put butter on
anyway pour it over the
top just a handful of satanas that make
sure you're just in the gaps as well cuz
if they sit on top of the custard
they're going to burn on the
top so once you've done that you can
give me 200 g of cast Sugar y we're just
warming this cust it up now now at this
point I can throw in the chocolate cuz I
want it all to melt but then turn turn
the heat off cuz if you keep heating it
when it's got chocolate in there the
chocolate will obviously sink down to
the bottom and it's going to
burn half the sugar goes into the milk
half the sugar goes into your eggs
combine all that together if you can get
me some whiskey as well to go in here we
can
pour just a bit of this warm custard
over the top and then back into the
pan and then this is where the real
flavor comes in a good drop
whiskey bit more bit more it was Anthony
that was paying the bill for this for
his mistake anyway there you go bit more
of that put the C over the top and then
all we do now is just pour this mixture
over the top keep it quite flat to it
okay this will get rid of any eggshell
that Will's got in there and also the
vanilla just till it comes to the
top what you need to do is Soak this
mixture by pressing it down
and just leaving it just for a minute
before it goes into the
oven now set the oven to 200Â° Centigrade
this wants to go in for between 15 and
20
[Music]
minutes so just to finish this off
cheers will what I'm going to do is just
dust it with ice and sugar all over the
top plenty of ice and sugar now look at
the amount that I'm putting on loads and
loads and
loads got a blow TCH you can use a grill
if you
want if you lift this
out
[Music]
that good doll of ice cream nice
scoopful on the side there you go will
what you Reon to that very nice
