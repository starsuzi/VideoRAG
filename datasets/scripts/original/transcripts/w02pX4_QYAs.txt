people usually prefer buying
store-bought curd because they think
it's extremely complicated and most of
the time they get it wrong
but today i'm gonna show you how to make
curd at home and share with you the
simple tips and tricks to make this at
home
so first i'm going to start with boiling
some milk i have half a liter of full
fat or whole milk here
let's bring this to a boil
keep stirring on it lightly
[Music]
the milk has come to a complete boil
let's turn off the flame
and now i'm going to let this milk cool
down for at least an hour tip number one
instead of using the curd culture i'm
going to use buttermilk so i'm going to
make the buttermilk out of this culture
so i have two teaspoons of curd here
into this i'm going to add two teaspoons
of water
let's whisk this together
[Music]
the buttermilk is ready and the reason
why i use this is because it mixes with
the milk evenly now one r is up let's
remove the cream from the milk
[Music]
and now let's strain the milk in the
bowl that you want the curd to set in
you can even use a earthen pot if you
have one
[Music]
let's add in 2 tablespoons of this
buttermilk
[Music]
and mix it properly
[Music]
tip number two
in case if the weather is very cold you
need to again
warm this milk up very slightly and add
three tablespoons of buttermilk instead
of two and now cover the bowl and place
it in a warm and dry space like an oven
or a cupboard for at least four to five
hours to set in case of cold weather
keep it for six to seven hours to set
after the curd is nicely set refrigerate
it for at least two hours before you're
ready to serve
this is nicely set and refrigerated and
now let's cut through it
[Music]
