hi guys welcome to my Channel today I'm
going to show you how to make Chim
Changas I'm going to fry and then put it
in the oven so it's going to be really
crispy and I hope I'm saying their name
right let's look at the
ingredients um you need
some different color Peppers you can use
anything you have on hand I have sliced
onions this is mixture of uh
squash yellow squash and green
onions um pickled jalapenos pickled
olives I have Pinko beans here rinsed
and
drained red chili powder you can use
paprika if you don't want it that spicy
cumin
powder I believe this is onion powder
let me
see yeah that's onion this is garlic
pepper
salt I have enchilada sauce
here some
cheese
tortillas and I just took some
allpurpose flour and mix it with water
and I'll show you what I do with
it this is for our rice I like to use
the 5in rice because it gives the
texture of um restaurant style rice I
have
salsa just regular salsa you can make
you can add homemade or store-bought
this is um crushed up
Tomatoes it's about one tomato
corn
peas some onions and water that'll be
all let's go and cook let's start making
our rice here I have a pan with some
oil heating up and then I'm going to add
my
[Music]
onions add all your Eggies
[Music]
now okay let it cook for a while and
then we'll add our
rice
as you can see our onions and uh corn
and stuff is kind of cooked so now I'm
going to add my rice make a space for
it I'm making this
for my whole family and some guests so I
[Music]
think
that toast your um rice without adding
water first and it will give a really
nice
flavor just toast it for like 30 seconds
not for too
long
okay now I'm going to add
my
salt
pepper
garlic
powder we need same seasoning for the
stuffing
too onion
powder oh
it's some CH powder it smells amazing
here chili
powder and toast it for a second
okay I'm going to add my crushed
tomatoes My
Salsa do it a nice
turn
[Music]
Okay add your
water I think I'll need some
more cover it for at least
um about 10 minutes it's going to take
about 10 minutes and then you can keep
checking every 5 minute and fluff it up
with a fork and it'll be really good
okay while our rice is cooking I'm going
to make the stuffing now which is some
veggies and um you can use any veggies
you want choice is
yours um I'm going to add my onions here
I have about tablespoon of oil heated
going to add
[Music]
my on
my
[Music]
[Music]
let that cook for about 2 minutes and
then we'll add rest of our veggies
adding onion first to your oil gives it
really good flavor that's why everyone
adds onion or tast I do so y'all better
go
too as you can see our onions and
peppers are like kind of cooked now I'm
going to add rest of my
veggies all these veggies don't take
longer just the onion
and onion and um pepper
stew mix it
[Music]
well
okay add your onion
powder chili
powder telling you
guys huming
powder garlic
powder I don't know why put my salt away
add some
salt
pepper that's
good you can always add something after
you give it a taste
so let just cook
now this smells so good and our veggies
are
done now I'm going to add my pinto
beans I don't want to do it separately
cuz let's be honest it's going in one
TOA why waste
time when you can make it
easy
and you call me lazy
CU
I'm okay turn off your stove because
your pinto beans if you if you use
canned beans they're already cooked just
try and warm them up let this mixture
cool
down and then our rice is almost done
let me show you I'm going
to see that
it smells like I'm taking a
vacation in
Mexico with delicious food all around me
I'll just fluff your rice like
this and it'll be done in like 2 minutes
and then I'm going to let it cool down
and then we'll make our Chim Changas and
then I'll eat it okay my veggies and
rice are cool down completely well rice
is still kind of hot but if you want to
learn how to fold Chim Chagas like this
it's not going to fall
then keep watching right here if you
don't like it then you can
skip I'll take some of your
veggies just add a little because if you
add too much it's going to ooze out in
the oil and you don't want
that add some of your rice
Okay add your
cheese now
okay flatten your um mixture like this a
little so it be easier for you to
work fold your tortilla like
this and fold it again like
this Tu it in really tight make sure
it's really tight so this don't come out
then tuck this part
in this
part and then remember the mixture I
made of um allpurpose flour and water
it's kind of like a paste it's going to
act as glue looks like a glue
too
so just flip it on
top and there hold it for a second
so and put it like this until you fry
it onto this now I'm going to fry it and
eat
it
okay my to
here okay make sure o your oil is really
hot cuz if it's cold um all the tortilla
is going to
be
like it's going to be oily it's not
going to be crispy slow it add it to
your I mean oil water
okay and it's going to take about 2
minutes on each side or depends on how
crispy you want it I'm going to make
mine really
crispy if your oil is really hot like
mine it's going to take only 30 seconds
not 2 minutes and you can see it's
crispy and it's really
good even my husband said it's really
good I told him he can eat it later add
your another
one and your third
[Music]
one I'm done frying my um Chim Changas

cheese and put it into oven for about 3
to 4 4 minutes on
450 okay I just took my Chim Changas out
of oven and they look
