Okay, I'm laying some timber floorboards in
my lounge room and you see now it's got a problem
is I have to cut it around a circular fireplace
half and what I'm going to do is I've cut a
bit of cardboard the same size as one of the
boards and I'm gonna try and make that into
one of the templates see how we go
Just need a little bit more of an adjustment,
just about there.
I'll probably just use a file and pencil.
Just have to do a few adjustments,
give it another shot.
Look at there.
Okay, first one's done.
I'm going to use the same template just to
work out this next cut.
I've got it up against the board,
I've
got a bit too much over here so I'm just going
to put some tape on it and do it again,
rather than cut it
again.
That looks pretty good.
There's template number two.
Okay, that's my second one.
Now the template gives you a rough idea where
the cut has to go.
And
it wouldn't fit like the other one, it didn't
fit the first time, so I had to make a couple
of minor adjustments,
but
now that it's all done,
click in.
Okay,
as you can see that one there came out pretty good,
I've just got to do that last bit.
So,
I'll just show you one more and then I'll show
you the finished job.
Okay, this is my template,
put
it there.
So that's my template,
I'm going to cut that out and we'll see how we go.
Okay, stuffed up on this one, I cut the wrong
end, cut should be alright, but it's up side
down, so that one I'll use somewhere else.
I'll take this one off.
This wasn't my first cut either,
do a couple of little fine tuning, make sure
it came in alright.
So let's put that one in,
this one goes in.
Okay,
what I'm going to do now is the next few.
Okay, as you can see, it's all pretty finished,
it's got that little expansion joint, need
to work out what to put on there, and I've
decided that I'm going to cut these tiny little
pieces using my offcuts,
I'll glue that all the way around,
anyway, you get the drift, I'll glue it all
the way around and that will finish the job
off and once I've done that I'll just give
you the last little bit.
As you can see,
that's the last
piece done, it's all come out pretty well really,
I'm quite happy with the result,
I hope that helps you with your next project and yeah,
it's me signing off, have a great day and if
