hello everybody today I will show you
how you can laminate without a laminator
so instead of laminator you just need
the wi Scotch tape and also scissors in
case you don't have a dispenser for the
tape and so yeah I'll show you
how and so yeah I got this important
picture which I want to preserve for
like thousands of years and so yeah I
just start by opening the tape and cover
it like that and so yeah like make it
sure it goes over the edge there and
then because I don't have a dispenser I
just cut it off with
scissors and then you know re repeat
repeat it the same way like
[Music]
that and yeah like cover it over here so
it it's like all completely
covered and
then that like
[Music]
this and so now when I cover the whole
thing then I'm going to peel it off like
[Music]
this and so now turn it
over and on this side uh just uh put it
like this and then also the end bit as
well put it like that
and then put this bit like that and last
but not least this corner as
well and so yeah that's one side
laminated but I'm going to do the same
for the back as
[Music]
well okay so peel it off
again that and again put these bits
over move that and the other side as
well like
that and this little bit as
well and so yeah now you can see it's
laminated completely from uh both sides
and just to prove that it's working also
you know now it's much harder to tear it
you if try to tear it you can because
it's all you know covered in
tape and so I'm going to show you now
see I got the water here bucket water
and now look I can submerge it
completely see it's like all completely
under the water see and I could be
holding it for a long time but don't
want to waste your precious time so yeah
now look I pull it out and look it's
completely fine now just just water on
top of the tape which you can easily
just dry and look it's completely good
and it's laminated without a laminator
cuz laminator costs more and the tape
cost a lot less and so so yeah there you
go that's how you laminate without a
laminator thank you very much for
watching I will speak to you soon
