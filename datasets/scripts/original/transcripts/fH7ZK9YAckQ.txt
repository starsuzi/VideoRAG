hi i'm rob from ixcarriage.com today
we're going to show you how to change
the brake discs and pads on your car car
we're using for this demo is a 3 series
e46 bmw let's get started first job we
need to do is take the brake disc
locating bolt out and to loosen it off
you'll need to get somebody inside the
car with the foot on the brake to to to
just undo it the first couple of turns
because the disc will want to rotate
freely after it's loosened you can just
wind it out
completely remove that put it somewhere
safe
next job we need to do is remove the
brake pad retaining clip
it just
prizes
backwards and then get a pair of pliers
and out
next we have to remove the caliper from
the caliper carrier this is the carrier
here
and to do that we need to remove the
guide pins
which are just located behind these dust
covers here
pop those little caps off
and behind there are two allen key bolts
and we just need a seven mil
allen key
and we can remove those guide pins
the guide pins might need just a little
bit of persuading to
remove
when you have the guide pins out then
the caliper should just come off but if
the disc is really badly worn it's going
to be quite difficult to get the caliper
out over the edge of the the disc so you
might just need to do a bit of prising
to see
when they come out you might also need
to
try and push the piston back into the
caliper to free up some space to get the
caliper off
there we go
what we're going to do next is just
suspend the caliper from the spring here
so that we don't put any strain
on the brake hose so just use a cable
tight
through the eye of the caliper there
we'll hook it round
top of the coil spring
there we go and we can take the
pad out from the piston as you can see
really badly worn
and the back of the disc is extremely
badly worn as well
now we're just going to remove the last
pad it might need a bit of
gentle persuading
and then we have to take the caliper
carrier off all together
now the carrier should just come
straight off
i'll give it a good cleanup with the
wire brush
before we put that back now we're just
going to take the disc off
and put the new one on
depending on the condition of the disc
how long it's been on the car you might
just need a bit of gentle
persuasion to get it off
should come off relatively easily
as you can see this one is in terrible
condition
so the new disc seats nicely we'll just
clean round here with a wire brush
before we fit our new free max discs
we're just going to do a quick visual
check to make sure the
holes all line up and they're the same
diameter and they are
what we are going to do is just use a
little
very small amount of anti-seize grease
[Music]
the hub there just a tiny tiny bit
and always been extremely careful that
we don't get any
grease
near the friction surface of the braking
surface of the disc itself
so just a little bit
that's all we need
that's enough
pop the disc on
line up your disc with the locating hole
get your
locating bolt back in
just do that finger tight for now
if you do get any grease oil on the disc
just make sure you wipe it off before
you go any further
on both sides
now the disc is on we've taken the
carrier giving it a clean with the wire
brush especially where the pads are
going to sit and we just refit that
to the hub
the caliper carrier bolts need to be
torqued up to 88 foot-pounds so
set your torque wrench
just tighten those up
now before we can refit our pads we just
need to
cut the caliper down
and
we're going to have to wind back this
piston push this piston back as far as
we can into the caliper before we
compress the brake piston caliper you
just want to remove the cap from the
brake fluid reservoir
and the best thing to use
is a caliper wind back tool like this
simply pop it in
to the center of the caliper there
open it out and it has a half inch drive
you just put your normal
pop it in there and
just wind it gently
see the caliper start to push back so
the pistons start to push back
inside the caliper
now with the piston fully back in the
caliper we're just going to pop the pad
into this side of the caliper and we use
a tiny bit of the
anti-squeal
anti-seize grease
only a very small amount
just pop it around the edge of the
piston there
pop the pad
into the piston
and we just put a little bit on the
other side as well
slide that back into the carrier
now we can just position the caliper
back
into place
and just take a little bit of
wiggling
there we go now we have to pop our guide
pins back
into place
the guide pins should be torqued to
22 foot pounds
replace your dust caps
then we need to replace our retaining
clip
sure you remember to tighten the cap on
the brake fluid reservoir
with the cap back on the brake fluid
reservoir just get somebody to sit
inside the car put their foot on the
brake so that you can fully tighten up
the locating bolt on the disc brake
that's it the other side is exactly the
same it's always important to change
both sides if you're doing disks or pads
never just do the one side um we stock a
huge range of free max discs and pads
for virtually every make and model of
car and van on the road all available to
