How to Build the Perfect Barbeque Fire.
Build the perfect blazing barbeque fire and
experience a feeling of primal backyard pride
long before the rib-eyes are done.
You will need Newspaper Chimney canister Hardwood
lump charcoal Outdoor charcoal grill Long
wooden matches Fire tongs Fire-safe gloves
and a sheet pan.
Always use common sense and precaution when
working with fires.
Step 1.
Crush two sheets of newspaper into balls and
stuff into the bottom cage of the chimney
canister.
Step 2.
Fill the chimney canister with lump charcoal.
Wear shoes when working with flaming charcoal.
They don’t call it “hot foot” for nothing!
Step 3.
Remove the top grate of your barbeque and
rest the chimney canister on the bottom grate.
Strike a match and ignite the newspaper through
the holes in the bottom of the canister.
Note that you don’t need lighter fluid—just
regular newspaper and charcoal will do the
trick.
Step 4.
Leave the chimney canister on the bottom grate
for about 20 minutes.
The charcoal will smolder, flame, and then
begin to glow red.
Step 5.
Once all the charcoal in the chimney is glowing
red, turn the canister over and dump the hot
coals into the bottom grate of the barbeque.
For extra burn protection, use fire-safe gloves
when arranging coals.
Step 6.
Use fire tongs to spread the coals, creating
one higher, hotter side with more coals and
a medium-hot side with fewer coals.
Step 7.
Replace the top grate so the cooking grill
begins to heat.
Step 8.
If you are cooking a lot of food, or your
recipe calls for a long hot cooking time,
light another canister of charcoal—so those
coals will be ready when the grill starts
to cool down—and place it on a sheet pan.
Now get to grilling!

briquettes was one Ellsworth B.A.
Zwoyer, a Philadelphia man who patented a
design for them in 1897.
