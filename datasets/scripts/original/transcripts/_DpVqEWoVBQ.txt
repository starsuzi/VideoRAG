cans are found all over a lot of people
just discard them throw them on the side
of the road you can find a can about
anywhere and so we're going to take a
look at some survival ideas using a can
and this is just a great free resource
to be able to recycle these old cans
another super easy project is to just
take a can draw a line right down the
center make a big capital
I then you take a
razor doesn't have to be precise just
gives you some
guidelines now once I cut down the
center I take a little small pair of U
scissors
open up your little
wings fold them
back take your small tealight candle
these are so inexpensive and you can buy
them like packs of 50 really
inexpensively set that in the bottom of
your can and you have a little
reflector this will reflect the light
and of course you can adjust these
little wings as you want adjust your tab
and use that as a hanger so you can
actually hang this in your tent around
your csite or if the power goes out
makes it a lot better than just the
tealight candle itself next we're going
to make a canned torch uh you can use
this for different things for their
light uh you could even probably cook a
little something on it or for warmth and
we're going to use olive oil and we're
going to use a couple of napkins you
could probably use just one paper towel
first thing you want to do is roll up a
couple of napkins together good and
tight we're going to probably cut this
to make it a little shorter you want to
fit it down in your
can
next you need to go ahead and get the uh
olive oil on your Wick and this is
really what this is going to be just
Wick get it good
soaked you can even use uh cooking oil
as well which should probably be a
little cheaper
we're going to
pour the olive oil in the
can about
halfway take your Wick drop it down
in then we're going to just light
it there we go it'll burn for a good
while uh it's going to Wick the oil out
of the bottom of the can through the
paper towel or the uh napkin in this
case now we have a light nice little
light for warmth light or obviously you
could even cook a little something on
here if you set it up right one of my
favorite uses is a penny can stove this
is really cool to make it's a fun
project I've done a video on this in
fact it's a pretty popular video uh and
I'm going to leave the link right here
for you to check out but putting this
together even with the kids getting
together and just doing this project
it's a great little way to have a
portable stove and it's just for pennies
I mean it's really cheap here we're
using the little alcohol stove to make
us some char cloth but we're going to
cut out some foil we'll cut out a long
strip we're going to make a survival
whistle this is a pretty cool little
deal and once you get a piece cut out
you're going to want to make two two
smaller pieces one you're going to make
is 2 in long by 3/4 in wide let's take
you a
Sharpie we go 2 in this doesn't have to
be exact but you want to be pretty
close you cut that piece
out the next piece is going to be 1 and
1/4 in Long by a/
in okay leave a small tab at the top and
place your smaller piece
across and then just bend back the two
ears on the
side then we're going to bend this
little area back as
well
should look something like
this now take a small knife and open up
that in between and you're going to want
to be real careful not to stab
yourself but just open it
up then bring that lower area right here
in front of the small piece bring it
down to a
90Â° angle similar to this then just
bring around the other area like
this what that's going to do you're
going to blow here and then you close
off these two
edges right
here have a little bit of space in
between and you'll need to adjust it and
once you fiddle with it you'll
be able to get it it may take a minute
or two got this closed off the air on
each side I'm holding this finger down
to keep pressure on
it not a bad whistle you can even leave
these flattened out and keep them in
your bill fold if you ever just need it
it's something really handy a whistle
like this for signaling uh for danger
just a great little item to have next
we're going to make a small hanger using
a pop top I use this cleaner area to
make the little hook so I'm going to
come in just snip
it you want to leave it kind of straight
because what'll happen is if you bend it
to the side it's weaker here it's really
strong then I'm going to just cut off
this top area to give me a little bit of
room and then I can just expand it if I
need to there's an area up here that
you're really going to need need to
clean up a little bit it's a really thin
area the area around it is rolled but
this is just a flat area so I'm going to
take my needle-nose pliers just kind of
bend it and this will keep any kind of
cordage from getting broke getting cut
or
frayed plus it'll give you a little more
stability at the top just like that now
you can use any cordage but we're going
to use a parac cord pull it through the
top just make a nice little double
knot okay you may look at that and say
you know that's not much but I just
bought this set of nails and you know
it's pretty weighty let's hook
it no problem at all it'll lift it right
up so any kind of pack or anything else
you want to get out of the way even
putting food up high keep it away from
animals you're going to be able to use
that little hook next we're going to
make an improvised Fish Hook now one of
the things you want to do here is make
sure not only did you have a sharp tip
but you also have have a small uh little
Barb and this is a little bit tricky
there are a lot of U videos out there
showing how to do this and some of them
are different uh first thing is to go
ahead and just snip this top
part and then to get a really good hook
we're going to bring this up really
high clip that then I like to clip right
at the center just go ahe and knock that
out and that'll disable this area so
you're going to have already have a fish
hook look already right here is where
we're going to put our hole but before
we do that we're going to bend this area
back just a little
bit give it a little bit more stability
get it out of the
way uh the more you mess with this
though the more it's going to weaken the
metal so just be careful to keep it down
you can also reinforce this a little bit
to be able to put your hole for your
fishing line right there now you want to
make your Barb and you want to cut in at
an
angle this is probably the most tricky
part here you have a very sharp point
you have your Barb which is really
important and now we're going to take a
small all or something to make a hole
right here you want to take something
with a really sharp
point and just make your
hole
once you get the hole made take your
your needl noose pliers just make sure
that you don't you don't want to have
any sharp edges for your
line now you have a small hole where you
can run your fishing line through or
whatever you happen to have and this
will be a great way it is strong this
direction so uh at least it'll get you
going especially if you're running out
of Fish Hooks now the bottom of the can
itself can be used as a reflector and
I'm going to use just some aluminum p
paste or polish this is actually wheel
polish but you can also use sand you can
even use clay and just rub and polish
that
aluminum here's the bottom of the can as
you can see it really takes on a decent
polish and I'm going to show you a
couple of uses here this can be used as
a signaling
mirror get pretty bright also you'll
notice from the reflection if you get it
close enough it really gets an intense
beam
if you had some char cloth you could
light a fire in fact I've seen a couple
of instances on YouTube where they've
actually lit fires with
this guys it's really amazing all the
things that you can do with just normal
common items and being able just to
improvise to be able to do something uh
in a tough situation you know many of us
think we keep things on hand at all
times but you know as well as I do that
you're always needing something and in
an emergency situation that could really
be serious this will hopefully just get
you to think and um putting those items
together for a survival situation be
strong be of good courage God Bless
America long live the
republic
now I need to put out that light because
it is huge and is stinking up my shop
with olive
oil also if you'll notice from
that
