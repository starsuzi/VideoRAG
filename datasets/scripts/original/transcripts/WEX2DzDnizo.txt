well hello again let me just replace
this camera
for
here okay hello guys
um this video Welcome to the Bushcraft
Channel um I I just want to I think uh
one of the last videos you saw maybe was
the video about how I sharpened my knife
on the DC4 I don't know where it is
right now is the he higami
knife is it the what's the name yes it's
the higonokami knife and
um one of the things was that you
couldn't really get a mirror polish on
the knife but it was really sharp as
demonstrated in the video so just go
watch the
video I'm going to show you how to make
a mirror polish on this knife
okay guys so you start off with a with a
lower grid it depends on how How deep
the scratch marks are in your your knife
like if if you got really if you've got
really deep scratch marks you would use
a really low grid like for instance 120
or two something else I use 400 because
I don't need to go any low and I think
that's quite uh rough already but you
can go as long as you want if you want
to start on on on a thousand you'll be
doing this step longer but it's it's
possible you
know anyway so how lower the grit how
deeper the scratches go that's why it
also would build up in uh in
stages okay and this is the way you
would you would um sharpen your
knife to get the mirror polish because
this knife hasn't got
that see that you want to look at
yourself you can't cuz there's no M
polish I already made this joke in the
outtake but I thought it was so funny I
just make it
again
anyway this is uh this is the way this
is also the same way how you would how
you sharpen a convex grind this knife is
scand effect that means that um your
knife is kind of a mix between a scandy
so it's scandy like this see but it it's
a little bit it's got a little slight
curve to
it which makes it a scanny Vex because
it's a mix this is my probably my
favorite grind because it cuts through
wood really easily I like to sharpen it
because you can exactly see the line
which you want to uh keep there's a lot
of there's a lot of how you would say
that meat behind the
edge yeah
so this is how you would the first step
to how you would kind of make your knife
shiny and mirror and also very sharp
because this is exactly the same way as
how you would sharpen a
knife yeah so you want to make sure
before you go to the next step that this
is already kind of sharp it kind of
bites into your finger already it
doesn't really have
to it's not NE Neary
but I I like to use that as a kind of a
uh kind of
a um I just went to my thousand Stone so
this is my thousand git Stone keep using
water I've got a little cup of water
over here don't use too much because
they table will get wet it's not
necessary this is a little rubber mat
that I use for my stone to keep
grip I place my camera on a slightly
different angle um
um on base of an advice that Martin gave
me because
um the the the video was uh how you say
that going up and down because I was
pressing on the
table so this is thousand so this will
give me a lot more of a mirror mirror
polish normally it's very important as
well that you always check your Edge you
keep checking your Edge if it's in the
right angle if you've got all the edge
problems out of it if not you keep on
grinding keep on grinding keep on
grinding and the the whole if you would
you if you would go for a scandy grind
you would just place your scandy flat
and push it forward like
this and do it the same way and you will
count Strokes like for instance 4X four
four four uh whereas with convex you
just put it forward and backward and
Rock It Rock It forwards backwards a
little
bit I think
the one of the
best knife sharpeners I've seen on
YouTube is probably uh it's probably wo
on his channel virtual Vice which I
learned a lot from so if you want to
check out his sharpening videos this
might might be a good one as
well um you can see certain techniques
you don't see with the others I've see a
lot of his technique in my sharpening I
mean if you sharpen your lives a lot
you'll you'll learn your own stuff you
know so keep on
sharpening keep on doing it don't forget
to add water if your sharpening stone
gets wet don't press too
hard don't press too soft don't press
too much in your stone keep it to an
angle of probably uh I'll show you my
angle how do I get this in FM you can't
really show you no can't show
you can't show you I'm not going to do
it so and if you every time if you want
to go for the ultimate mirror
polish you always check have I still got
the scratches of the previous Stone in
my knife if you still have keep on
grinding on the on the present
Stone otherwise you're never going to
get them up
no matter how long your straw portion go
whatever just keep on keep on doing
it as you can see I've now continued to
my uh 3000 grit
Stone if you want the best mirror or
whatever the best
mirror you might want to go for the you
might want to go for extra steps so like
like
2,000 yeah that's the only one actually
between 1,000 and 3,000 but
anyway I'm just going to show you rough
mirror but if you do this as long as
possible you know it depends on how uh
how perfect you want to get it like if
you want to completely mirror you'll
probably be busy for a long time and I
mean I need to go to bed in a minute
because I've been awake for 45 hours
already you know and I'm you know I need
sleep now those are jokes people no want
need to hate
me very funny jokes as
well
okay in the end I will show you as well
I've I've got examples um I've got
places in my knife which which are more
mirror as other places and that exactly
the example I can give you what happens
if you skip if you skip stones or if you
if you progress to uh next Stones too
early but you can see the mirror finish
at the end I mean that's sure short of
that just do the same as that you're
doing on all the other
Stones so now I'm just going to repeat
repeat the progress and uh on this very
ugly 5000 Stone which belongs to Martin
no joking it's a shepon 5000 Stone and
um I think for for Mirror polish the
step from uh 3,000 to 8,000 is well
might be too
big I mean I've never had any problems
with it but you know you might I'm just
trying to make a good
video well this for me will be the final
Stone um it's the 8,000 Stone the the
naniwa Snow White and
um you could get a mirror polish ready
if you stop with the 3,000 Stone which I
always used to do so you don't need to
get a uh 400,000 2,000 3,000 just
400,000 3,000 you get a mirror polish
but how higher the grit of the stone how
better the mirror polish will be of
course because it would just polish more
of the scratches away and make it
finer and uh
anyway blue paper steel in my opinion
doesn't get the best mirror because
every steel gets uh gets a different
mirror grind or mirror polish I
mean and I think o1 steel gets a really
nice mirror polish so and and I know
that's a really popular Steel
okay well uh after using all the
stones this this will be the mirror
polish that it's
got uh in on this knife and I mean you
might think wow that's not that much
because yeah you can see it in a right
angle like this it's a good miror um and
what you also can see that this knife is
lemonade so here you could see a little
bit you could see a line you see it more
clear which is more mirror than the rest
because it's lemonade so it means that
the blue paper steel is in the center
and the the outer layers are not and
over here you can
see scratch marks that I didn't take the
time to um rofile with a with a fine
stone or I mean with a rough Stone so
anyway the last step which is in my
opinion the most important step is get
the strob marget a black and white
compound this is what you do no
problem and then the funny thing is that
if you do that long
enough your knife completely changes and
becomes this knife no no joking I'm just
joking they're making a
joke you do that long enough start with
the like compound I like that
compound
and then if you can see that now already
it looks much more mirror you can see
this line much
clearer I don't really like my impairs
if I'm that close to the
camera then you go over the white white
um compound and the way you do that is
tilt the knife in the angle that it just
about touches uh the Le the leather with
the edge so it's not the leather is not
going across the edge or hitting the
edge or whatever how you would name it
but it's just scraping it's touching
it cuz you don't want it to go dog and
you want it to go
sharp and that's also kind of the trick
you want to make knife look really
mirror but you don't want it to go
um you don't want it to go die you want
it to go as sharp as possible and if you
done it if you've done it the right way
then your knife will be scary
sharp
okay well this will be my end
result and I would say that's pretty
mirror
you see a bit of Filth over that so but
this is really
mirror and you can get it more mirror if
you use finest stones but yeah it's a
mirror and um to demonstrate the
sharpness of it of course again use the
hairs oh yes they're gone um paper paper
Mar paper
please sorry one two three
got
and Tada the sharpness is there and the
mirror so I made the same video with the
with this knife which also with
the when I was also sharpening it on the
DC4 and it got also really sharp but it
didn't get this mirror polish and this
is what I also like
aesthetically I mean I think it looks
good so this is how you sharpen a knife
uh and make it look mirror
and that's how you do it don't forget to
tilt your knife if you want it in a
convex way just keep on rocking it if
you want to scany keep it flat Mar will
make a different video of that um if you
want if you want to look good go to a
headdress otherwise you look like me
