Right bit of a experiments today
retro clean time
this is the old Acorn Electron the
little baby brother to the BBC micro
and yellowish plastic as you see there's
not
how are quite remember it's kind of a
bit yellow
so I went do their watched YouTube and
they've got myself some for 40 volume
twelve percent this lansilk screen
thing is about four quid delivered and
we're going to try a bit of this
watching the old YouTube video
apparently the yellowness is caused by
ultraviolet and yeah if you actually
cover this over then covering in cling film
and then exposed to ultraviolet it will
restore it or hopefully back to his
original color so we're going to give it
a go
right first thing Im going to do for this
experiment to remove the keyboard
there's one way to do it just do the top
side leaving the bottom side original
and so we can actually see what a
difference if any it makes and i do have
a few other computers i would like to try
this on
so I'm intrigued so right screws out
keyboard off a little bit of foam
nothing to worry about don't know if
i need to remove that plastic might try
with it on see what happens
and ma ruin this sticker and
i will know for the future
ok right
4 hours later know it the top case has been
sunning yourself for four hours and the
back and the other half is slightly
change the color of the Acorn Logo
but here's the difference
top treated and bottom standard
yeah
and hopefully you can see the difference
more evident there
so the texture we're going to do is the
the keys and i will be nice
so all i did errr
I probably only used a egg cup full of
the stuff and brushed it on
with just a paintbrush wrap the whole
lot in cling film and I just sat it on
my window sill for about four hours
and yes I had kind of impressive I
quite like that
just got to do the rest
and also repair me asking me "S" key
 my "S" Key dont work as well on this okay
many thanks for watching hope that was
interesting i will have to to look back in the video
see if it's change the colors that
didn't bother mask off or removeing that
the rest of it doesn't look has
changed but yeah we'll compare
ok don't forget to subscribe
many thanks for watching
