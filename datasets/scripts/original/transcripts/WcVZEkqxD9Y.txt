today I'm going to show you an easy
method to machine sew a fully lined
sleeveless dress I started on this
garment by sewing the shoulder seams of
both the dress Fabric and the liner
fabric then I sewed clipped and turned
the
neckline if you like you can finish the
neckline with a blind stitch like I've
done
here after that it's time to sew the
sleeveless arm holes
today I'm going to show you the roll
method to do this you will lay the
Garment flat as you see here then you
will roll the dress from one side toward
the other it's best to do a nice tight
[Music]
roll like this
then you will flip the fabric that you
have
underneath over top like
this so this is the fabric that I have
underneath I'm going to flip it
over the
roll and I will line my shoulder seams
up and pin it into place
I like to make sure that my seams match
up
perfectly and you will
pin all of the sleeveless armhole
together
okay so I took this to the machine and I
sewed the armhole seam went back and
clipped now we're going to turn it
doesn't matter which direction you pull
from you can pull either way but we're
going to pull the
roll out of the dress or out of the
shoulder
seam and we
have one shoulder seam
shoulder seam and armhole seam complete
now we're going to do the same thing to
the other
side we're going to roll we'll lay it
flat do a nice tight roll we can go back
and press all of this
afterwards do a nice tight roll
and then we will take the fabric that's
underneath and we will flip
it
over the roll there's our
roll we'll line up our shoulder seams
and do the same thing again
okay now I did my other shoulder seam
turned and pressed clipped the corner
clipped the curves turned and pressed so
both of my armhole seams are complete
the next step would be to sew the side
seams of your garment so we're going to
put right sides
together we will take this end
of the armhole opening and match it up
with the opposite
one then we will
pin and
sew the fabric right side right sides
together and the liner right sides
together and we will do this for both
sides the left side and the right side
of your
garment make sure you line
up your seams your armhole seams
perfectly
