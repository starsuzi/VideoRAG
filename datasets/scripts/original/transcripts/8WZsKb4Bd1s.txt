good day guys today I'm going to show
you how I make some of my favorite lamb
chops and it's very easy so I'm going to
start by making a chili paste so into a
blender add one large red
[Music]
chili two large cloves of garlic or
three smaller
ones a/4 of an
onion two teaspoon of
cumin 1 and 1/2 taspo of
salt and a tablespoon of olive
oil mix together well until it forms a
nice smooth
[Music]
paste just like
that and here I've got a/ kilo of lamb
chops you can choose whichever cut you
want for
this
and now it's simply a case of coating
those chops well now if you're using
bare hands like I have here make sure
you wash them well afterwards so you
don't get chili in your eyes now place
this into the fridge overnight if you
like or you can cook them right
away so onto a nice hot barbecue grill
just place on those lamb
chops now you might have noticed that I
haven't added any herbs to this marinade
now this is because I'm actually adding
some sprigs of rosemary to the grill and
they're going to create some beautiful
Rosemary smoke and they'll give these
lamb chops a big Flavor
Boost now make sure you cook with the
lid down so that smoke can encapsulate
those lamb
chops turn after a couple of
[Music]
minutes
[Music]
then continue to cook these until
they're done to your
liking and there you have it guys
enjoy and those are delicious guys as I
said at the start they are one of my
favorite lamb chops so be sure to give
them a go they are so quick and easy
thanks for watching and I'll catch you
all next time oh
