okay alright so what I'm doing here is
I'm making my sauce but let's Mon ch√©ri
look I do the Italian sausage a real
important method to this I like to get
this jump over Italian smiles what you
do is you boil down the sausage boil
down the water by the sausages in here
and I take this fork and we're just
gonna drop these right in the pan and
this is going to boil down probably
takes about 20 minutes to a half an hour
you're gonna let the water boil down the
whole time and then when the water is
totally gone you're gonna Brown the
sausage pretty good and then you're
gonna take it right from the pan and put
it into the sauce and get the sauce
going over here you can you gonna shut
your sauce going and then when this is
done you're gonna put them in this dump
Brown drop them right in there I'll put
these in
sauce is boiling in the pan what you may
be doing for a good two inches so then
flip them over every now and then
there's a water is one halfway through
this process you're gonna the water's
like halfway gone you're going to cut
this off into some good music
okay we're making progress on the
sausage water is boiling down sausage is
nothing good I have the sauce starting
over here
fresh garden tomatoes in there I got my
pace and sauce I'm gonna add in there
looking good okay this is a very short
part here visiting with all the water
boils down to start turning is over
just about where you want the brown
that's right there
okay now that you have the sausage done
the brand drop them in the sauce store
gently while they're in the sauce
now you're gonna cook those once it's in
there stir gently it's gonna cook in
there for another three hours
which what makes it so tender good
sausages you'd be able to cut with a
fork
real easy real tender and so we browned
it in there and put it in here a proper
cook in the pan for 30 minutes and
that's when you year can be ours
I always break
