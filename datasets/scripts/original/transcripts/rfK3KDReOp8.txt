hi I'm Casey and I most definitely have
a crush on food and today I have a crush
on turnips
on the count of three everybody say your
favorite vegetable one two three bell
peppers eggplant arugula
well okay I probably have more than one
that's like asking me to name my
favorite child turnips might not be in
my top five but I do like them and I do
eat them
the turnips are a root vegetable
they're not the most attractive but
everybody deserves to be loved don't you
think and they're a great substitute for
potatoes if you're having a hamburger or
a steak they have the same consistency
almost as a potato they don't taste like
a potato but they're a great substitute
if you want to cut some carbs out of
your diet so I usually dice them up
I cut off the bottom
and the top normally they have
a purple ring around the top and that's
where the greens grow out of the ground
but lately at the grocery store they
haven't had the purple ring not sure
what that means but
I just do that I cut it in half and then
I cut it in wedges
like this and then I just Cube them up
I'm going to put them on a baking sheet
that's already coated with a little bit
of oil you can use cooking spray or you
can just drizzle some olive oil on there
so I'm going to finish chopping these up
and then we'll season them
so I dice them all up and I got them on
my baking sheet so I'm just going to put
a little bit of olive oil on them
and took some salt and pepper
a little bit of salt
you can cut these into wedges if you
want and almost make like a french fry
out of them too
and you can even
when they're done put a little bit of
Parmesan cheese shredded parmesan cheese
on them
and that'll be good they kind of have a
bite to them almost like a radish does
but it does definitely mellow out a
little bit roasting them in the oven so
I have the oven preheated to 375.
and I've tossed these up got the olive
oil all
moved around so that they're coated and
about 20 minutes you can roast them
they'll get nice and brown tastes good
like that
so
I'm gonna
put these in the oven and we'll be back
when they're done
turnips are done and I did roast them a
little bit longer than 20 minutes
probably closer to 30 just to make sure
they were nice and brown
um
they look great and actually sometimes I
eat them with ketchup tastes really good
with ketchup I don't know if I should
admit that but especially if you're
gonna have one with the hamburger and
you have to have ketchup so I hope that
you feel adventurous and you pick up
some turnips at the grocery store and
you roast them
