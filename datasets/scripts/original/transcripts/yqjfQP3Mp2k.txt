when a piece of boneless meat or poultry
is of uneven thickness it won't cook
evenly thinner parts get overcooked by
the time the thicker parts are done you
can even things out by butterflying the
food this means cutting it horizontally
almost but not entirely in half and then
to open it like a book start on the
thicker side of the piece of meat hold a
sharp knife parallel to the cutting
surface and carefully slice the meat
almost completely in half stopping about
a quarter-inch from the other side open
the meat like a book and Pat it out to
an even thickness
butterflied meat or poultry will cook
more evenly and more quickly
