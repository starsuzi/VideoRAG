- Hey friends.
- Hey everyone.
- Thank you so much for
tuning in to Cook with April
on Thirsty Thursday.
Today I'm going to make an
inspired white chocolate mocha.
Inspired by Starbucks.
And I think it tastes just
like it 'cause I'm using
the exact same white chocolate sauce.
So, stay tuned!
So let's get started.
I went ahead and put a pod in my Verismo,
an espresso pod, and
then I'm gonna go ahead
and press the espresso button right here.
(loud, continuous buzzing)
After you get your espresso
you're just gonna go ahead
and get the Fontana White Chocolate Sauce.
This is actually the one
they use at Starbucks.
That's why it tastes legit.
So you're gonna just do one pump,
or two if you prefer.
Since that's hot, get a spoon
and just mix that together.
And then you can add some cream.
So I went ahead and added ice
and I placed it in a glass.
And you can also add whipped cream.
And you're ready to enjoy your
iced white chocolate mocha.
Alrighty, Justin can try,
but if you don't want it,
I can have it.
- (laughs loudly) All right, here we go.
I must say, that tastes
identical to the Starbucks one.
- Yes, it does!
- It really does--
- [April] You know why?
It's a Starbucks Verismo pod,
it's the Starbucks white chocolate sauce,
and I googled up the measurements.
It's espresso, a lotta ice, some cream,
so to me it taste just like it.
- Well you better hurry up 'cause
I'm drinking this whole thing.
Mmm-mm!
- (laughing) Give me a sip.
Just kidding.
