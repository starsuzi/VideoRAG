hi everyone this is Michael with Harvey
jewelry designs today I'm going to do a
video tutorial on how I make my silver
leaves now I make several different
types of leaves different sizes and
shapes but today I'm just going to show
you how I make my basic uh s-shaped Lea
I know a lot of you have had questions
on how I do that um it's taken me about
a a year to finally get a good
system down and techniques to where I'm
able to produce a nice looking leaf that
I like so if you're at the beginning
stages and you've tried before and it
just didn't come out quite as well um
you know just give it another try again
it's just going to take some time and
some practice is definitely what it is
but in this video I hope that you will
learn uh different techniques and
something that'll be able to help you to
make some awesome looking leaves so with
that let's go ahead and get started on
the tutorial all right I just want to go
go over what I'll be using in the video
um we have here I'll go with the start
off with this one I'll talk about this
here in just a little bit later U but
this is a scribe that I Ed to mark on
the uh Silver Plate just makes it a lot
easier I'll explain a little bit more
about that later on uh just some
scissors shears to cut little metal
pieces off as well uh we have little
stamp straight stamp for the detail
stamping um of course a jeweler saw
and wax lubricant for the Jeweler saw
and then my little needle
file which is the uh I guess uh triangle
one I
guess yeah that's what I use and oh and
of course the hammer when we're uh using
our stamp here to make the little leaf
details in it all right so that's the
the tool list as far as that let's go
and get started on making our Leaf all
righty what we have here are my
templates that I use for uh my leaves I
have uh you can draw out other ones as
well you don't have to use the specific
design but these are what I go by I just
place these onto a plate I use a 26
gauge plate I think a 26 gauge for a
leaf is a good uh thickness if you'd
like to use a little bit thicker you're
more than welcome to but I wouldn't use
anything uh thinner
uh than a 26 gauge because when you go
to dome it right here where you have U
stamped it with the lines could possibly
tear so I think a 26 gauge plate works
perfectly well okay so um have my plate
take my leaf here and then I'm going to
use my scribe tool and I'm just going to
scribe the outline of it this thing is
very very very useful I use it on every
single piece that I do um so any what
we're going to do is get this scribed on
on there and then we're going to cut
that out here in just a second all
right all righty if you can see the
outline of it okay all right so let's go
ahead and get started um let me see all
right cool I poked myself with the edge
of this thing or with one of the edges
and it started
bleeding be very very
careful I'm always poking myself myself
and burning myself and you know it's not
a good combination when you're naturally
clumsy and you're working with sharp
blades and
fire I have to be extra careful all
right so I have my Jeweler saw here this
is just your standard you know uh
german-made Jeweler saw um this thing is
super old I I swear all of these tools
that I'm well not all most of the tools
that use in here um are hand-me-downs
for my mom and uh for my dad so these
things are I guarantee you are older
than me
um look at this I mean this is a piece
of wax a wax ball that you know we use
to put on the uh to lubricate the uh the
blade that's very important you want to
make sure that you lubricate your blade
so that it doesn't stink and it makes it
easier to cut but I guarantee you this
thing is probably older than me me I'm
32 years old and I'm pretty sure this is
older than
me probably I think that's the only one
that they've ever bought but that's
pretty crazy um any who so what we're
going to do is we're going to start here
at the tip and we have the rounded part
that's up here I like to start right
there cuz it's got a nice sharp edge and
just makes it easier to start there so
let me give it one look all
righty getting started seems to be a can
be a little tricky sometimes um what I
find that works the best for me is going
super slow you know just get a
little get going just a little and then
once you see that you're starting to cut
into it you start going a little bit
faster
oops okay be very careful I don't want
to snap that blade these things break
very easily so you have to be really
careful

all righty get that cut
[Music]
out all right this uh did not do a very
good job with this one um right here if
you can see it's a little flat it's not
quite
rounded but that's okay because once we
put the um do the stamping
and put in a little um half round or not
half round round wire in the middle to
be like the little vein that goes in the
middle um and then we do the filing
detailing on the ends you won't really
notice that so looks pretty
good all right let's go ahead and move
on to the next
step
okay what I have
here is a 20 round wire this we're going
to use for the center of the leaf so
what you can
do take your
pencil I said that with an
accent take your pencil um and just kind
of draw a
line where you like
it now it doesn't have to be like dead
center or anything throughout this but
it's just kind of for a
guide all
right now I'm going to use my round
no and I'm just going to shape
it kind of like how I think it will
go
okay
you know my mom she's made so many
leaves over the years she uses the
scissors that she's
had you
know since before the flood I swear I
don't know how she uses those scissors
I'll have to show them to you but um I
can't cut them out like she does she'll
get a nice Cut like this with using her
scissors but I have to saw them out and
that's the only way I can get a nice
shape because if I try to use something
else it just doesn't
work for
me okay that looks
good just going to make a little cut cut
that off right
there
think that looks pretty good just make
sure it lays flat on your plate now you
want a little bit of a hang-off at each
end with the
wire so when you solder you can just
kind of trim that off however you like
it or even if you like you can make this
part here um a little bit longer and use
it for like a decorative you can like
twist it and then place it onto your
piece that would look kind of cool
um but we're not going to do that
today okay get your flux and just put it
on
there there we
go
okay then I have a kind of a low heat
it's not too
high heat up your
Leaf all right we want to put just a
little bit of solder you don't want to
put too much just until you see it run
so I can happen really
quick I like to do one at each end that
moved let's see if we can get that to go
back there we
are
better just to
smidge
okay there we are I'm going to go and
get that in the pickle and then next we
will stamp it
