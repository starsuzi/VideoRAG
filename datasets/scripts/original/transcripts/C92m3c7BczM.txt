Different people
pronounce pho
different ways.
Some people say fo,
some say, you know,
fa or however it may be.
But the real one is pho.
Hi, my name is Mike Kha,
and this is my dad.
Hi, my name in
Vincent Kha.
I'm the owner of Pho and
Cafe Ahn Hong.
And we're going to teach
you how to eat pho.
Pho is composed
of rice noodle,
different cuts of meat.
The most important thing
about the pho
is its broth.
We put a bone first, then
we put the beef belly,
then we put brisket,
then you have to cook it
at least seven hours.
I put scallion
on top of this.
And I put cilantro,
culantro, and green
onion on top of this.
And that's it.
That's a bowl of pho.
When you eat pho, I,
you have, before you,
you eat,
when the bowl come out,
don't pour this thing and
this thing in.
If you put them in then
you cannot take the pho
good or not.
But when you try couple
spoonful then you know
pho is good or or not.
What kind of tastes
are you looking for
when you first
try the soup?
I had to try if they
cook, you know,
with bone or.
How do you distinguish
between the two?
How do you know if
there's bone or
not, like?
I know because I cook
it for long time.
Okay.
You want a sweet,
beef broth flavor.
Some good stuff,
you know.
So what do we have here?
That brisket.
We have.
Beef ball.
Beef balls.
And rare beef steak.
Rare beef steak.
This is flank.
Yeah.
And here we have tendon.
Now these are all
preferences.
So you have beef,
flank, tendon.
And we have strip.
And then we have
tripe here.
Yeah, tripe.
A traditional way of
setting up your pho is to
put your hoisin sauce and
hot sauce on the side.
To me, I never put
this thing on my pho.
I will put this
all on the side.
The right way to do it is
put it on the side and
whenever you want
to dip put your,
pick up and, and eat.
And then you.
So you dip it in?
Dip it, then yeah.
Then eat it.
Yeah.
What, what would you
say this is like?
It's, it's sweet.
You know,
you know carrot,
you know what carrot and
corn is, Chinese ketchup.
When you eat pho, this,
this thing, the basil,
in Vietnamese we call it
this is the number
one to put in it.
Your pho will taste more
better, a lot of better.
It will taste
more better?
Without this, without
this one, the pho not,
you know, it's not.
So, so why do you put
it on the side if
you need it?
Because, I put on
the side because if you,
you put it in here this
will turn, turn black.
So when you eat,
you get to put it in,
then eat right away.
Okay.
The rest of
the stuff here,
minus the basils are all
preferences whether or
not you like bean sprouts
or jalapeno peppers.
And, you know,
lime for sweetness.
Yeah, squirt the lime.
After you have all
the side dishes in,
you just wanna mix it up.
You know, get,
spread out your noodles,
get it going here.
Mix up different flavors.
Generally, it's, they,
we use chopsticks
almost for everything.
Yeah.
For everything.
The only time you
would use a spoon is
for the soup.
When you eat pho, right,
and after you eat and
when your mouth
get thirsty,
that mean a lot
of MSG in there.
That thing will kill you.
There you have it.
That's how you eat pho.
Ciao.
Ciao.
Bye-bye.
