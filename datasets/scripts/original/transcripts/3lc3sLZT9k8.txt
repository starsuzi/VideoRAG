there could be several reasons why your
pie cracks on top one has to do with the
oven rack position when you're baking a
pumpkin pie you should not bake it on
the upper racks you should always bake
it on the middle or even the lowest oven
rack so let's move this one
down also what's most important is that
you keep an eye on your baked time it's
always good to check any recipe even
whether it's a pie or not a couple of
minutes before the minimum baked time
that's stated on the label or on your
recipe so with your pumpkin pie make
sure to start checking it at 35 minutes
or 40 minutes the minimum time
