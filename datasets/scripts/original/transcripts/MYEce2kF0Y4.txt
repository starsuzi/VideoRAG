dimension mark the center for in the
bulb and ease and added 1 centimeters in
elements in both side here add one
centimeter in the overlapping in the
center so it seems that we add house in
the middle each side so the proper
calculation is 7 plus 7 plus house and

will be 7 centimeter for the width how
to make it prepare the fabric here is
the straight ran line mark the center
