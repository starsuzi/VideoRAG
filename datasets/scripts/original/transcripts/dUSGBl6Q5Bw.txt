let's go browning here and today's exciting 
episode we are going to discuss chisels so  
let's take a look at the man alright so what we 
have here is the two cherries hornbeam handle  
sit you see it's got like a steel ring at the 
top it's a wooden handle this is the twenty  
mill and the twenty-six twelve sixteen ten and 
finally the six move now the other thing that is  
in my sit is this sucker here the qunari know me 
hearing chisel from Fujikawa in Japan this thing  
is a beauty basically it's a paring chisel used 
not with a mallet it's used with just the force  
of your hand to just slice those last uneven 
layers of a chick out or a you know if you're  
doing a check out for ahead and review or doing 
like a mortise and tenon this is just to shave  
those last little bits and get a mint they come 
in different sizes as well but this is the only  
size I have and I really like it the hoop on the 
back here so the sides are the only power that you  
need to flatten when you put it on the stones 
now obviously you've got to get your chisels  
in to where you want it to go using something 
and I use the two cherries Carver's melon when  
you're carving something you change angles all 
the time so I like it just because I don't have  
to look at the chisel when I'm hitting it I can 
just focus on what I'm choosing but it's awfully  
big it's quite a big thing to use especially 
when you're in and around door locks and you  
know little tight areas so for that kind of turn 
this with two cherries extravaganza that I use
this is a heavy little mallet the mallet does all 
the work if you know what I mean you just have to  
go out there the downside is that it tends to 
where the timber on your chisel a little bit  
quicker okay so that's my basic chisel set a lot 
of people have asked me about is how I sharpen  
these chisels so there's two stones that I have 
I have the Norton the Norton India oil stone here  
this is the one I've had the longest and that's 
okay it's not bad it just requires a bit of oil  
in order to work for smells like a mechanic's 
garage but I've since moved on to a whetstone and  
I basically copy the samurai carpenter here he's 
got wet stones like this and he's got about half  
a dozen of them and he's got he's built a pond 
and you know it's got a drip pipe and everything  
and I mean a lot of you guys would have seen this 
video so you'll know what I'm talking about but  
I've only got the one whetstone so far and it's 
the 500 do you call it grit as a like sandpaper  
with a bit of water and patience this is a great 
stone to use to sharpen these two cherries chisels
this is how I've been sharpening things for a 
while just by hand on this wit stuff I'll put  
a little link to the summer carpenters video on 
sharpening because you're gonna get a lot more  
from that than you Wilson this so I basically 
just start with the back and work on getting  
it flat sometimes they do a figure of eight 
so I don't put a gouge in the winter so this  
is the hard part getting this bevel consistent 
I recently added to my sharpening collection  
after an event I went through on Thursday last 
week it was a tool demo from Veritas tools they  
make amazing planners and spoke shaves and a 
guy named Vic Teslin from Canada was here in  
New Zealand to do some demos and I think he's 
touring around Australia as well he showed us  
a bunch of things he showed us the low angle 
Jack plane and why it's so good and how many  
different angles the blade can be sit in order 
to plane and smooth different things he also  
showed us the sharpening guide and we all put 
our names in a hat and basically pulled it out  
and my name didn't come up but the guy in front 
of me my mate his name came up and without even  
looking he just grabbed the prize and handed it 
over shoulder to me because he already had it at  
his workshop at home and now I have it the Veritas 
honing guide mark to standard I had a little play  
with it last week I'm not really I'm no expert 
and using this stuff Vic Teslin did show us but  
I'm a notoriously bad classroom students so it's 
gonna take a few more watching of YouTube videos  
and trial and error for me to get it but what I 
do know is you basically get a chisel like this  
or a planer blade and has different settings up 
here it comes with this little gauge as well this  
is how you actually [ __ ] it but like I said 
I neither be more acquainted with it before I  
show you that you put it in like this and then you 
tighten it now the whole idea of this honing guide  
is it keeps the blade in the correct position 
as you continuously sharpened the beveled angle
and the little wheel at the bottom here helps 
you roll along and you just continuously go like  
that oh my god cuz that I didn't even know 
this existed until until I saw on Thursday
so one thing one thing that Vic Teslin said last 
week which is which I thought was a good way of  
looking at it is it doesn't really matter how 
you sharpen it or what you sharpen or wealth  
the goal is to get through flat plains to meet 
at an edge that needs to be flat that needs to  
be flat and that edge needs to be sharp that's 
the goal two flat surfaces meeting at an edge
so I also keep the chisels and this 
Taurus chisel raw so a company in New  
Zealand they make tool belts as well it keeps 
it pretty men you know nice and snug in there  
you roll it up this handle sticks out but 
it's okay you go like that the clip broke  
off but that's okay to think about that 
Wow unroll it and you're ready for action
