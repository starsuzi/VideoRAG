Add the chopped mint leaves, parsley, crushed garlic cloves, olive 
 oil, and spices to the bowl. Mix well.
Add a little bit of water to dilute the mixture. Mix well.
Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap and place it 
 in the fridge for at least 1 hour. 
You can marinate the lamb chops overnight if you want.  
You can grill the lamb chops in your barbecue grill or a 
 grilling plate that you place on top of a stove.
Note: If you are using a grill plate, cover 
 it with a little bit of olive oil.
Grill the lamb chops on both sides for a few minutes each side. 
Note: grill the lamb for a shorter time if you like 
 meat rare or medium-rare, and longer for well done. 
Serve the lamb chops with rice and vegetables.
