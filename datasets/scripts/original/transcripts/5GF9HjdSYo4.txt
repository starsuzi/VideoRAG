hello I'd like to show you how to put
fondant icing or roll out icing as it's
called Uh which really describes it well
onto this 7in Victoria sandwich cake
it's on a 9in board which allows plenty
of room for if you're holding it around
the sides I've already covered it with
buttercream I made the buttercream from
3 oz of butter and 6 oz of Sifty icing
sugar or powdered sugar as our American
friends call it um there it is you can
see it's lovely and soft it's like
whipped up cream never have the
buttercream too stiff otherwise it'll
pull the crumbs off the cake if you do
find that
happens um soften the buttercream down
with a very small amount of milk until
it'll Glide easily over the cake so
there we have the cake sometimes people
instead of using buttercream they use um
to stick onto the what we're wanting is
something that'll stick the rollout
icing onto the cake and as I say jam can
be used but I find that jam sinks into
the cake whereas the buttercream will
cover up any little holes or cracks that
are on the cake making a nice smooth
surface so I have here the roll out
icing
already I've weighed it and it's
approximately
750 G or 3/4 of a
pound what you need to do before you
start rolling out the icing is to make
sure it's going to be the right size and
that is the size approximately that I
needed for this cake so how I measured
it
was and do this before you apply your
buttercream otherwise you'll find you'll
end up with a sticky piece of
string down onto the board up one side
across the top and down the other side
and there we have a piece of string that
you're going to use for
measuring I have a long rolling pin here
uh especially if you have a very large
cake you need a long rolling pin
otherwise you'll find it'll Mark the
paste and what I want to do is to make
sure I have a nice smooth top on the
paste and I'm going to keep moving it
that stops IT sticking and also keeps it
in a nice round
shape so a few
rolls and then give it a
turn I'm using icing sugar to roll out
on not cornflour again sometimes you see
that cornflour is being used cornflour
is fine because it's very as I've just
said fine it's very smooth but what can
happen that it absorbs very easily into
the paste and it could make it
dry so keep on rolling we want it
approximately a/4 of an inch thick make
sure there's no little bumps or lumps on
your rolling pin because these can
always Mark the
paste
however if you do Mark the paste you can
rub it like that with the warmth of your
hands usually takes any marks away so
we're getting near the size I should
imagine let's
see more or less I'll just give it an
extra little roll this side and then
I'll apply it to the
cake and how I apply it is I put the
rolling p in the center of the icing
flip the icing over now rather than
stretch across the table which makes it
awkward and bringing the cake towards
myself then watching what I'm
doing the icing goes slowly otherwise
you'll trap air over and there we
are now people sometimes get into
trouble with pushing the icing down in
fact pushing isn't the right word you
want to pull it up just gently ease it
up ease out these overlaps like that if
you've done any dress making this is the
sort of thing you do with material so
you're well well into the way of
it just the sock part of your hand into
the
base and pull it
down
this Icing By the way can be frozen
either in a packet in a freezer bag or
else when it's already on the
cake freezes very
well the only thing is it comes out and
once it gets into the warm air from a
freezer um you'll get condensation on it
just leave it in the fridge for a day or
two and it'll all evaporate there we are
that's all pressed into the base
I'm going to cut off the
excess but I'm leaving some extra at the
base
because the next job I'm going to do is
to make sure it is all stuck to the base
of the
cake which reminds me to say to you that
when you put your butter cream on do
make sure that it's right down at the
base otherwise what happens is you'll
find when you go to put the icing on it
doesn't stick right to the base
it's better to think about these things
before they happen then you don't have
to try and get out of
trouble I'll just tidy it
again and as you can see I'm using a
turntable which is Big
acid because it enables you to twist the
cake ground very
easily that's done
now I'm going to use what's called a
smoother you can buy these from the cake
decorating shops smooth it smooth the
top of the icing over go around the Sid
smooth it onto the
sides and there in a very few minutes
you have a nice nicely decorated cake
and you can also go like this and
that'll get you a a nice curve on the
top I just get rid of this icing sugar
and then I want
to show you something
else what I want to show you is a quick
decoration for around the base of the
cake now
traditionally um royal icing was applied
around the base piped Scrolls or shells
around the base but that's takes quite a
time and uh this is an easy method and
very colorful a piece of ribbon so you
measure your piece of ribbon ribbon
which I've already done I've got a brush
here by the way I use brushes that have
have a percentage of sable in them quite
often in cake decorating you need a
brush and it's worthwhile buying a
decent one to start with so I'm just
moistening the base of the cake
around I'm making sure the ribbon is
right at the base there's a little bit
of icing right at the base of the cake
sticking one
end taking a pin with a colored top just
to hold the ribbon in position
moistening the other part of the
cake
and overlapping the two pieces then
putting
the pin in it's a pin with a colored
head so that I can see it easily once
that's dry it'll stick the ribbon will
stick to the cake and you can take the
pin out and there it is right around
there I have already made in another one
of the videos some roses made out of the
same paste if you liked you
could put a cluster of roses maybe not
on the little plaque because I do it
because it's easier to handle but there
you see some roses matching up with the
color of the ribbon would look very nice
and also you need some leaves because
that shows the color of the Roses
up well I hope you've enjoyed that
little video and the quick way of
applying icing to a sponge cake goodbye
then
