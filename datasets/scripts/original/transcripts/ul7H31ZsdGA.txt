Hello, my name is  Deanna Franklin and I'm with Texas A&M AgriLife Extension and I've got a great recipe
for your Dinner Tonight. Today we're cooking up orzo garlic chicken.
You will want to go ahead and cook 1 cup of orzo
according to the package directions, and I've already done that. Next,
we're going to add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a hot skillet.
We're going to add 2 garlic cloves that have been minced.
 
And then we're going to add 1/4 cup of crushed 
red pepper.
Alright, next, we're going to add two chicken breast halves
that I have cut up into bite-size pieces.
 
And what
you're going to want to do is you're going to want to cook this chicken until the juices run
clear and we're going to let that cook for about
5 minutes. Okay, now that our chicken
is cooked, we're going to add 1 tablespoon of parsley.
Now you could, if you wanted, use fresh parsley for this.
I am choosing today to use dried parsley. And then I'm going to add our
pasta to our dish.
 
We're going to mix that up.
And lastly, we're going to add
2 cups of fresh spinach leaves.
Now we're
going to mix this up together and then we're going to cover it up again and let it cook for
a little while until the spinach leaves are wilted.
Alright, so now our spinach is wilted and we are
ready to serve our dish. You can serve this
with some carrots on the side, or a salad
if you would like.
And last, we're going to garnish with a little bit of grated Parmesan
cheese.
So the next time you're wondering what's for dinner, we hope you'll check out
