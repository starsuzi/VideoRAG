the first thing you have to remember is
you need to watch the integrating single
sources video first you need to watch
that first but this will make no sense
to you at all
to get me do you understand
let me pause so you can see the big
blinking thing on the screen okay
good sign of the Bible is simply the
same as in science is signing a single
source except things are done a little
bit differently because it's chapter and
verse so let's start with the simple
quote so from the quote Romans 8 chapter
8 verse 1 I do it simply like this of
course if I could spell that would be a
good thing and cutting them pasting
would be a wonderful thing as well
tada notice what idea now first off you
don't know what the version of Idol is
so let me put it up here for you and I
so what I will do now is go
and I put Roman Rabbit chapter verse
notice a couple of things here notice I
put the version full name of the version
the international version when I quote
again from the same version I only need
to abbreviate it I'll show you how to do
that in a minute
notice that Romans is shortened as well
abbreviated as well notice that we use
colons we used periods to separate
chapter and verse and finally a period
those after here of course since I am
too anal retentive about this type of
stuff I will make sure that all my font
is the same no let me get rid of that
one there because do not put that there
and tada Paul states is now no
condemnation blah blah blah blah and
Christ Jesus and you've coated that's
see how just like the single source
parenthetical citation it is if I wanted
to paraphrase I would just start I would
do something like this
Pauline's believes leaves that we we are
not held accountable for us
because of Christ and in the same way I
will be this and since I am quoting from
the same version I would do this
Romans 8:1 period tada
excellent a right wonderful beautiful if
I were to do the same thing through 4
verses 1 & 2 it would simply do like
this Paul argues
you see I too can be suave and debonair
by cutting and pasting and not wasting
time nice ass set us free yes
and that the NIV because I have I have
continued to quote something I mean how
are you Roman
now would you 8 1 2 . cuz I noticed some
other things too as well I see strong
verbs I just don't say States States
States States States dull dull dull dull
and that is how you cite the Bible so
farewell and yeah I got nothing else so
goodbye
