[Music]
all right chicken hands are you ready to
handle some chickens
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
we're working with our compost making
chicken coop again today we did this a
few weeks ago I think it was the number
50 and already it's full again with
straw so I add straw a couple of flakes
or one flake per day and the chickens
mix it all up and fertilize it and it
heats up underneath them so it's keeping
them warm but it's filling up really
fast I started doing this in the summer
by digging holes and putting the chicken
tractor on top of them and then having
their compost fill up the holes and then
moving it to the next but since it's
winter time we're keeping them in one
place we've got to move the chickens off
get the compost out and put the chickens
back up on so this compost actually
stays hot we move it over here and then
it's been staying hot in this pile too
and shrinking down to half again it size
in the next couple weeks we found a
compost cooked egg yeah it's actually
Kirk it's mostly done cooked by the
compost over weeks real tasty and we
didn't realize there and when we came to
clean out the compost we found it had
been cooked by the high temperatures of
the compost so it's probably soft-boiled
would you sure does it required a soft
boil I have no idea anyway
it's getting hot
yep you got to drag it over to the other
pile you can do it but real talk this is
really time-consuming so we much prefer
to move the chickens off of the compost
just take them to their next place
rather than doing what we're doing right
now which is cleaning out underneath the
chickens this is probably the last time
we're going to pull this move to run at
you I read chicken with I would just hop
into this one you'd like that one huh
the one at the end maybe it's more fun
okay that's good
that's Alex city you need help what they
need it to clean themselves dirt to
clean off worse if we have a broody hen
we'll let her have babies okay
now you could be on break
let's strip off the boots and
sweatshirts and jeans and everything
[Music]
I must be waiting on material for the
house because huh the weather's really
great outside but I'm in here making
apple fritters and that's okay yeah it's
always dinnertime at 5:02 so Nick made a
deal that when we reached 90 thousand
subscribers he's gonna fix our broken
clock which is over here this one right
here behind me this broken clock always
shows 502 but it's a specialty part and
Nick has to go into town to get it to
fix it so when we get to ninety thousand
subscribers then it will fix the clock I
just use vegetable oil for frying oil
and I tend to strain it and keep it we
also do we do a couple of deep fried
things not a lot french fries apple
fritters a couple of those things
the oil is supposed to be 325 and we got
pretty close 330 ish I don't have three
