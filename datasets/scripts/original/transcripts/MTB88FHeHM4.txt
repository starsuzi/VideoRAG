wintertime
rice cakes people also put tofu in its
tomato it's about the right temperature
for disaster all the vegetables are
still crunchy do we need a giant spoon
for this ring hi sup flavor it's this -
like that or you want more
the flavor is different than a destroy
at the restaurant this one will make
your tongue known people also keep the
hot pot in the peanut butter sauce it's
spicy
I think we should try to use mild sauce
next time I am sauce and I really like
to eat the root of foie gras
I think I forgot to add one thing
there's one thing missing
no it's not a sauce it's a I don't know
how to say in English the chunk melted
the chocolate yeah he's like chicken
flavor or beef flavor maybe we can add
some the chicken broth soup chicken
broth yes so we can ask that you come
across we are missing something

my first time we have chicken broth
there
do you move this knowledge talking I
keep it
yes I think we should add some the
chicken Brussels has more flavor
we're so hungry what you're looking I'm
looking for the tallest what these tall
tall yes favors we can't put some nodoz
in you can't add some blue Greta sauce

be very jealous now can't pick it up
well hello to fish balls oh people also
put the noun in it the various things

peanut sauce that's all these better oh
maybe we can use the peanut butter to
make no sauce if you like that it's all
sweet because the fishbowl I think the
whole house smells like hot pot next
time we need to get a mild sauce all we
need to have two sides of the pot a
spicy side it's too spicy for you
you know this burning sensation on your
tongue you can't really taste the
mushrooms you can't wait to taste
anything I can't taste because even a
very spicy for me I can't eat spicy food
bother you
