hey guys so today we're going to be
making a waterfall loom bracelet so
let's get started what you're going to
do I'm going to take my first color
which is pink and you're going to go
from here all the way down to the other
end so you put it on and
over and you just go all the way down
until you reach the
end
okay now with your same color you're
going to go down the other side leaving
out the
middle
okay so let's go back to the
beginning and now you're going to do the
middle row so you can choose a different
color so I'm going to have purple and
you're going to go down the middle
row you're going to go all the way
down so now you should have something
that looks like
this okay okay now what you're going to
do is you're going to flip it
around so it's facing you like
that you're then going to get your next
color so I'm going to use black and
you're going to put it on these
three so you can bring it
over and up so it looks like
that okay so you're going to do this all
the way up so next I'm going to take
these
three
go up and you're going to do it on the
next
one and you're going to keep doing it
until you get all the way to the other
end
okay so you're not going to do these N3
because you're going to use that later
on so now it should look like
this so what you're going to do is
you're going to take your little pck and
you're going to grab this pink and bring
it over here so how you're going to do
that is you're going to go under the
black you're going to grab the pink
bring it
up and pull it
over so it looks like that then you're
going to go under the black grab the
pink bring it up and pull it over so
you're going to do that all the way to
the end so just remember to go under the
black
bring up the
pink and pull it
over okay so one last time go under the
black grab the
pink bring it up and pull it over and
continue that until you get to the
end
okay so that side should look like that
now you're going to go to this side and
do exactly the same all the way up so
remember to go under the black grab the
pink and bring it up under the black
grab the
pink bring it up and just do it all the
way until you get to the other
end
so both the sides should look like
that okay now what you're going to do is
you're going to do the center strip okay
so this band here the purple is the only
one that's on there you're going to take
it off and you're going to put it over
onto the next one so you're going over
the black
string okay now what you're going to do
is you're going to grab the pubble
that's
underneath bring it up and over
everything so it's at the
top going under grabbing the
purple bring it up and go over
everything
there we go so now you should have
something that looks like
this you're going to go to the other end
and what you're going to do is you're
going to take off all of these bands
on this one and put it onto the middle
one okay so it's probably easier to use
your
hands like that and you're going to do
it to this side as
well so you take it
off and you hook it on there you go so
they're just all on this end
piece what you're going to do is you're
going to get your hook you're going to
go under all all of these bands at the
end so really wedge it in there and
stick it out then you're going to get
your
band hook it on you're going to bring it
up like that then you're going to hook
it in okay so also wedge it in so it
doesn't fall off so it should be like
that okay so now that you've got it
hooked you can take them all off
I take mine off one side at a time just
because it's quite difficult to take
them off but you can just pull them off
if yours is easier to do that
so after you've pulled it off you have
your
bracelet okay so we're not done
yet you need to get an S Clip or C clip
and what you're going to do is you're
going to attach it to these two bands
here and you're going to attach it like
that so now you can take off this
side so it's
attached so it should be attached like
this now what we need to do is we need
to make an extension for it because it's
a little bit
small so you're going to get this back
going to twist it I'm going to do in
pink so you can do about six or seven
bands so we're doing this so that it can
fit your wrist
better so this part that sticks out here
you're going to put it on here to
here like that and bring it over now you
can just let that go so let me turn it
around so it'll probably be
easier okay so you're going to leave out
the first one and go to this one you're
going to grab the pink band bring it up
and attach it on to the next Peg
you're going to go under grab the pink
band bring it up and attach it
on then you're going to do the
same until you get to the
end
like that so if we go back to this end
you can
now take off it off a few pegs don't
take it off all of
them so I'll bring that up so I can show
you okay I'd say leave about three now
with your S Clip or C clip you're going
to attach it to these two B bands
okay like that and now you can take it
off so that is your
extension okay guys so this is how to
make your waterful loom
bracelet with your extension at the
other
side so if You' liked my tutorial then
