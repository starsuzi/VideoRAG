hi everybody today we are outdoors and so I'd 
like to show you how we can make a fish trap  
with very limited amounts of resources first 
and foremost we need a bottle and because we  
are out in the open it may be a bit difficult 
to find now we will cut a window in the bottle
it should look something like this unscrew 
the bottle cap then we should make a couple  
of small holes in the base of the bottle so 
that the water may come out but don't make  
them too big not to let the fish escape the 
next thing we need is a threat if we don't  
have one of hands we may use shoelaces or make 
one out of stamps we rub the thread around the  
neck of the bottle a few times and start 
our trap is almost ready we just need to  
fill it with bait it's better to use bread 
crumbs or crunchies and we also made the gap  
some worms haurache grasshopper fish will bite 
first too now take some baits and put it into  
the bottle then fill the bottle with water 
and set her trap so let us see the process
about five to ten minutes have passed 
now let's see if we've got something
as we see we got some small fishes of 
course there's not a luxurious trophy  
but I think it should make a hungry 
traveler very happy especially if  
there's nothing else to eat now we 
are going to return them back thank  
you all for your attention don't forget

try to make more interesting and fun videos 
thank you all once again see in the next one
