We are going to make Chimichangas. They are going to have 1 pound of chicken, 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion, avocado, and garlic.
Also, some chicken juice saved from when the chicken was cooked, a package of flour tortillas, and some vegetable oil. 
We are going to begin by adding vegetable oil to the frying pan, 
We pour in the onion, and we'll cook it till it's soft. To add flavor to the meat. 
I cooked and prepared the chicken the day before, to have it ready for the Chimichangas today. 
Now that the onion is nice and soft, we are going to add one small clove of garlic, chopped. And we let this cook a little while.
Now that we have this cooked, we will add the chicken. 
We will let this cook for a while, and absorb the flavor of the onion and garlic. 
Now we are adding a little of the juice from when we cooked the chicken. This will add to the flavor. And we'll let this cook about 10 minutes.
OK, I let this cook for about ten minutes. You want to give it time for the flavor to cook in.  I'll turn off the heat and take the next step. 
Here we have a tortilla, and we are going to put the chicken inside. 
And we are going to fold it. Fold the 2 ends so the chicken doesn't come out. Here it is completely closed and ready for the pan.
Here we have the cooking oil in the pan, and we are going to brown the Chimichangas. We are going to watch them get a golden brown, and not burn.
When I have the Chimichangas cooking, I press down on them a little, this will help to keep them from opening when I turn them over.
This amount of brown is how they should get. These will brown quickly. About 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side.
Now we will let these cook on the other side.
Now we go back to the other side to finish these up. Now they are ready to remove and put on a plate.
If you want you can set them on their side to cook that too.
These Chimichangas are ready. We are going to let them dry on a plate with some paper towels. 
Now these Chimichangas are ready to have the toppings added. 
We are going to add sour cream, lettuce, avocado, and salsa. And Parmesan cheese.
Now the Chimichangas are ready to serve.
