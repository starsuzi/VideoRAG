- Today I'm going to show you how to make
these adorable turkey cupcakes.
They have all the fall colors,
but inside, it's a moist and fluffy
chocolate cupcake that you will die for.
Okay, let's get started.
We're starting off our batter by sifting
the dry ingredients into the bowl
of our standing mixer, beginning with
one and a half cups of all purpose flour,
one and a third cup of granulated sugar,
three quarters of a
teaspoon of baking powder,
one and a half teaspoons of baking soda
and half a teaspoon of salt.
Definitely don't forget the cocoa powder
when you're making a chocolate cake.
A third of a cup of a
high quality cocoa powder.
Give it a sift.
We're going to give this a
quick whisk and then set aside.
Cloud of cocoa powder.
Now we're gonna mix the wet ingredients
into a bowl and of
course, I'm just going to
remind you that in a chocolate cake
the butter rarely comes through
and that's why a lot of them
are oil based, like mine.
Okay, a third of a cup of vegetable oil.
This recipe calls for
half a cup of buttermilk,
but I'm out of buttermilk.
Sometimes I use buttermilk powder
but incase you don't have that handy
you can also just squeeze a little bit
of lemon juice into the milk and that'll
help curdle it and what buttermilk is
is really like an acidic milk.
Give it a little bit of a whisk.
Okay, now let's add that in.
Healthy splash of
vanilla, two medium eggs,
love those yolks, a
quarter cup of sour cream.
Before I add my hot coffee
in, I'm gonna give this
a little whisk so the
eggs don't get cooked.
Just so you know, it's
always nice to add in
warmer ingredients when
you're making a cake
so that it'll bake more evenly
and a little bit more quickly.
You don't wanna put ice
cold batter into an oven
because the center will
take a lot longer to cook.
(whisking sound)
Now I'm gonna add three
quarters of a cup of
hot, very strong coffee from my mocha pot.
This is basically
expresso, just so you know.
(whisking sound)
If you don't wanna use
coffee in this recipe
go ahead, skip it, you
could use warm water,
you could use more milk, any
liquid is basically fine.
Coffee will bring out the
chocolate flavor though.
So when you eat this
cake, you're not tasting
a mocha chocolate cake, or a coffee cake,
you're just gonna taste a
chocolatey, chocolate cake.
I promise, even though
it seems like you're
adding a lot of coffee in there.
Also, if you're worried about the caffeine
or your feeding it to
kids and you don't want
them hyped up, just go
ahead and use decaf coffee.
Okay, that's all mixed up
and we're gonna set it aside.
Oh, but it smells so good.
I could drink this right now.
Livin' that dad life.
Okay, let's add that paddle attachment on.
Now, while this is mixing
on like, medium low,
level two, we're going to
add the wet to the dry.
(mixer sound)
Mmm
All right, I'm gonna let this mix for
like a minute longer, but I wanna scrape
the bottom down, just
incase there's any flour
hanging out there that's
not getting mixed.
Oh, and this batter smells so good,
I can't even tell you.
You have to make this recipe.
I couldn't decide which papers to use
so I have gold and red,
but not in that order.
Okay, I'm using an ice cream scoop to add
about the same amount of
batter in each cupcake.
I find it's really the neatest way
because this gets so messy, especially
when your batter is liquidy
like this chocolate batter is.
This is like that batter
where you're like,
"oh my gosh, it's pure
liquid, how is it gonna
turn into a solid?".
But it does, magically.
My first batch of cupcakes is ready to go
into the oven at 350 for
maybe 20, 30 minutes,
we'll see.
Center has to be set.
While my cupcakes are baking in the oven,
I'm gonna whip up a quick batch
of American buttercream
for the decorations.
You could use Italian
buttercream if you want
and you can click up at
the top of the screen
for my "how to make
Italian buttercream video"
but American buttercream
is gonna be really
nice to pipe and it's not
gonna be too delicate,
so I can fudge around
with it and not worry,
if that makes sense.
Paddle attachment, one
pound of unsalted butter
at room temperature into
your standing mixer.
That's four sticks for us in America.
Give it a little mix to cream it together
(mixer sound)
My butter is nice and
creamy so we're gonna
take it off of the standing
mixer and then sift in about two
pounds of confectioners sugar.
Whoa, two pounds of sugar, that's so much.
Well, it's divided into
little tiny cupcakes
and this sound be enough
for my 18 cupcakes.
So, worry alittle bit less.
Also, it's the holidays.
We're going to add a little bit of sugar
at a time so we don't have a giant mess.
We all know that I'm a bit messy.
I always like to sift powdered sugar
when I'm making buttercream because nobody
wants a clog in their piping tip.
If that happens, it can get really gnarly
and frustrating and baking should be
easy and pleasurable, not frustrating.
Put that back on and mix, on low.
You can add a splash of
vanilla in at this point too.
(mixing sound)
Okay, back to sifting.
All right, back on to the
mixer, repeat that process.
Okay, so I used like a
pound and two thirdsish.
Take a look, the consistency's nice.
You can see it's pretty
strong, it doesn't have
a lot of air bubbles in
it and it tastes good.
Mmm, American buttercream.
Now I'm gonna divide this
into several batches.
A little bit of yellow for the feathers.
A little bit of orange,
red, brown for the feathers.
Probably some really
dark brown for the body
and then that might be it.
I'll leave a little bit of white
just incase I wanna pipe some eyes.
To pipe this turkey's
tail, I'm using small
petal tips, so basically anything from
like a 101 to a 103 will work fine.
Just go back and forth
to create some ripples.
This'll simulate feathers.
I'm starting off with red,
then I'm moving to orange
and finally yellow.
For the turkey's neck and head I'm using
a large round tip or an 809,
and just try to pipe it nice and smooth.
Put an extra dollop on top for the head.
For the whites of the
eyes I'm using a little
bit of white buttercream
and then I'm popping in
a mini chocolate chip upside
down for that eyeball.
Use that 101 tip with
some yellow buttercream
for the beak, and then just add in
a little bit of red for the gobble.
So I'm not gonna be eating
these cupcakes on camera.
I know, I know.
But, I'm saving them for a special dinner
as you might imagine.
