just watch all the
[Music]
emergencies hey guys got milk no so
today Alexis and I are going to show you
how to make milk so plant-based milks
are really delicious and they can be
used for your coffee in the morning for
milk and your cereal or even for baking
and Alexis and I are very busy women and
this recipe is perfect for us cuz it's
really quick and easy to do so uh
let's
[Applause]
go okay so the first thing you want to
do is hit the bulk store and get some
cashew nuts then you're just going to
cover them with water and put them in
the fridge overnight so our next step is
we're going to pour out the water and
rinse the
cashews and we want to rinse them until
the water runs clear so the reason why
cashews are actually ideal for making
cashew milk is they're actually quite a
fatty nut and um when you soak them
overnight they really absorb
the water really well okay Lexi what
next okay so we're going to take the
cashews and put them in the blender and
then I need two cups of
water what's nice about cashew is that
you can use a blender and not a food
processor cuz they're super super soft
so they'll break down really
easily
one blending
time it already looks like milk look how
awesome that is
I know about you but I'm obsessed with
cashews I used to like dip cashews in
like Ben ofite oh
go so you can add two more cups if you
want it to be thinner um or you can keep
it this way if you want a thick milk mhm
okay so we already tried some and it
actually tastes really milky so I'm
going to add 2 tablespoons of agave
nectar at the bulk store so we got it at
a different bul store made our video
in and we're I'm going to add two
teaspoons of vanilla
extract that was way too
intense I shouldn't have put that in my
mouth last two things we're just going
to add a dash of sea
salt and this is personal preference but
I like to add a little bit of
cinnamon sweet blend it all up and we're
done we're done
[Music]
ready Cheers
[Music]
[Laughter]
Cheers M delicious delicious so just a
last little
note I really like my cashew milk like
this cuz it's thick and sometimes you
can still taste like coarseness of the
nut in it feels more like a thick milk
texture that milk has but but Alexa I
prefer mine a little bit thinner so I
like to run mine through a cheesecloth
just once and then that kind of gets all
the bits out so enjoy guys
