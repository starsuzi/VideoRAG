this video I'll show you how to make 
salty almonds yes you need almonds  
and water you need both cold and hot 
water and then you need salt that's  
all take the hot water and add the 
salt this is half a cup of hot water
now this all must dissolve in the water and just 
keep stirring for a while untill you fall a sleep  
Nah don't worry it doesn't take long because 
the water is hot so it goes quickly all right  
so add the cold water in the hot salty 
water then you put your finger in it and  
measure the temperature if you don't burn 
yourself then it's okay now add the water  
to the almonds and they need to be coated in 
the water so just take a spoon or something  
and stir them around like this now you need to 
leave those for like 30 minutes in the water
and put the almonds in a strainer so you 
see the water from them just like this
preheat the oven to 175 Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit 
now pour the almonds onto a baking tray with  
some wax paper or parchment paper and just lay 
them out in an even layer then you need to put  
them in the oven and just leave them there 
for 10 minutes and then check how they are
this is what they look like after 10 
minutes they weren't still quite done  
yet so I gave them another 5 minutes then 
they were ready now I just leave them to  
cool just for a little bit and then you 
can put them in a container of some kind  
you know you can eat them you can eat them 
as a snack or you can crush them a bit and  
then put them on a salad so it's really up to 
you they're really tasty thank you for watching
