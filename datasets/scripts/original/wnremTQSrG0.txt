to begin using the Deboo a deluxe dicing
mandolin I'm going to insert the
horizontal blade with a straight edge
facing up
I've already adjusted my guide plate
that determines the thickness of the
slice next the pusher guide slides on
and then the potato to make a crinkle
cut adjust the horizontal blade so the
serrated edge is facing up
to make a waffle cut with a serrated
blade turn the pusher 90 degrees at the
top of the mandolin for fine julienne
the horizontal blade should have the
straight edge facing up I'm going to
select the fine julienne blade from the
blade storage box in the back of the
mandolin and insert it on the back use
the red blade for medium julienne
for large julienne use the great blade
for a large dice use the gray blade and
orient the pusher so the cube symbol is
facing away rotate the pusher 90 degrees
at the top of the mandoline for a
diamond cut the diamond symbol on the
pusher should face away at the top of
the mandoline rotate the pusher 45
degrees this stopper on the pusher guide
prevents over rotation
