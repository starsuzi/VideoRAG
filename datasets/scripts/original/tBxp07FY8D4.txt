Hi, my name is Mike Summers from Jim The Shoe
Doctor in Eugene Oregon. Today we're going
to be talking about cleaning and protecting
dance shoes, point shoes, ballet shoes, you
know, jazz style tap shoes, that sort of thing.
We'll start out with a, this is a basic dance
shoe. What you'd want to do with a shoe like
this, it's kind of hard because it's a metallic.
When you clean and protect a metallic shoe,
you can use just a neutral polish. This is
a leather shoe, or you can use a metallic
polish. The metallic polishes have to be a
pretty close match to look correct. You don't
want a tremendous amount of difference in
the appearance of the shine between the two.
When applying a polish to a shoe like that,
you just rub it in
and you want to cover the whole area. You
can use a soft cloth or a brush. I tend to
use cotton most of the time for cleaning most
things because it doesn't leave lint and residue
on the finish of the shoe. Once it is dried
for just a little bit, you can go back and
buff those sections and using the cotton cloth
or a brush. With using, colors like this,
you're probably going to want to use a cloth
because if you use a black brush for polishing
a shoe and then you go back and try and put
it on something like this, more than likely,
you're going to transfer color and it's going
to show up in the shoe. So best to use a clean
cloth so that you know that you're not putting
any other color back into the shoe. On point
shoes that are leather, you'd do basically
the same thing. You would first clean the
shoes. Especially with point shoes because
they contact the ground a lot and you have
to remove that dirt off the shoe. So you would
use a cleaner to remove the dirt and then
once you've removed that dirt on a leather
shoe. You would apply a polish, whatever color
would be correct or a neutral polish if you
can't find a polish that matches. With a satin
shoe, you would want to use a product like
this is made for suedes, satins, nylon, canvass.
You can use this on an athletic shoe, on many
different materials. This is a really good
cleaner. The only problem is that you have
to get the entire shoe wet when applying this
cleaner. You would work it in with a little
brush to clean it. You can use like a soft
bristle nylon brush to actually work the cleaner
into the nylon. Then you would take and rinse
the entire shoe off and then let it dry naturally.
You never want to heat a shoe when you're
drying it, so you could let it dry naturally.
That's how you would clean and protect a leather
or satin dance shoe. Thank you.
