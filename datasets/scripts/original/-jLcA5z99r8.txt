it's not very often that I make tips
videos mainly because I'm not an expert
woodw worker but I've found a method for
sharpening chisels and plain blades that
works really well for me and is
inexpensive so I thought I would share
my methods with you and hopefully this
helps some of you there are already lots
of excellent videos about sharpening on
YouTube Some of which taught me what I
know now and I'm going to be linking to
my favorite ones in the description box
below this video but this video is going
to be focusing on how you can get really
good results
inexpensively I will also include some
links in the description box below for
the products that I use so first I'm
going to talk about the equipment that I
use to sharpen and the first thing and
most important thing for me is a honing
guide previously I found sharpening to
be quite difficult without one of these
it's a cheap device it's only $4.99 in
screw fix which is where I bought mine
and for me it's worth every penny
secondly I use this double-sided diamond
plate it's 360 grit on one side 600 grit
on the other and these are available
currently on Amazon for
£14.99 made by
tadia now I found that 600 grit isn't
enough to achieve a really sharp edge so
the next product I use is this 1,200
grit wet and dry paper I tend to buy
this in tool station here in the UK as
it's only £60 for a pack of 10 sheets
you can also buy it in screw fix but
currently it's £379 for the same
quantity of sheets the final product I
use is this green polishing compound and
this is available on Amazon at
£539 the only other thing that I use is
a scrap of either MDF or plywood to show
you the method that I use I'm going to
be sharpening this 18 mm or 3/4 in
Stanley chisel so the first thing I want
to check is that the bottom of the
Chisel at the very tip is perfectly flat
doesn't have to be perfectly flat for
the full length of the Chisel just at
the tip I Ed some water with some
washing up Liquid in it to lubricate the
plate you could also use an oil but I
find that water does the job just fine
so I'm going to place the back of the
chisel down onto the diamond plate push
down with three fingers and move it
backwards and
forwards
now I can see from the abrasive marks on
the back of the Chisel that I've already
got a perfectly flat Edge at the front
which is
perfect so now I'm going to rotate the
plate to the 600 grit
side lubricate that
too and do the same again
next I'm going to tear off a piece of
this 1200 grip
paper pop that on the stone and add some
water there and then polish that back
Edge to 12200
grit I only use this 1200 grit wet and
dry paper because I don't have a stone
that's of an equivalent grit so you
could use a stone if you've got one or
if you want to buy one but this stuff
works fine for me I've got this piece of
MD F that's screwed onto a block of wood
and I'm going to stick that in the
vice and with the buffing
[Laughter]
compound just going to rub that on
there and now I can buff the back of
this
chisel
and you can see now on the back of the
Chisel at the very
tip we've got a mirror
finish so with the back of the Chisel
flattened off I can go back to the
diamond plate now to actually sharpen
the front edge of the Chisel I'm going
to put the Chisel in the
Vise and slide on the honing
guide as straight as I can and tighten
it with this thumb screw
through and to get the right bevel angle
on this chisel what I tend to do is to
set the distance between the tip of the
Chisel and the front of the honing guide
to somewhere between 3 and 1/2 and 4
cm and then you can tighten the honing
guide with a screwdriver just to make
sure that the chisel's not going to come
out so now I'm going to put the diamond
plate back into the
vice and start with the
360 grip side now you place this wheel
on the honing guide onto the
plate hold down the front of the
Chisel and sharen
Away now I just need to make sure I'm
cutting the very tip of the
Chisel and looks
good so now I'm going to go up to 600
grit
next I'm going to go back to the 1200
grit wet and dry
paper
finally back to the MDF
again
and then to remove the bur from the
back just going to give it one
stroke and there we have a nice shiny
Edge so the bevel that's now on this
chisel is
24° and now it's nice and
sharp
so using this method you can get
everything that you need for around
£25 to sharpen your chisels and your
hand plane blades for many many years so
hopefully that was useful to some of you
please let me know in the comments if it
was because I'm Keen to understand
whether it's worth me doing any more of
these type of vide videos also let me
know if you've got any suggestions as to
how I can improve my methods thanks for
