tonight and it's an Australian and New
Zealand tradition for a long time
now back in
1915 Australian and New Zealand Army
Corps went to galipoli
and they had to fight the good fight
incredibly brave people
but food was going to rot over there
they had no Refrigeration so arnut the
Australian Biscuit Company created Anzac
biscuits and this is their
recipe watch how to do it do it for
yourself and just enjoy it's

oh
was that easy or what so so simple and
I'm going to eat one now here it
is so so crunchy and so so delicious if
you don't want a crunchy cook cook it
for a little bit less if you want it
soft and chewy but wow these
things provided nutrition for our
soldiers in the Great
War please reflect upon those people for
a
moment the sacrifices that they
made the difficulty that they had in a
foreign country living
rough
respect and
these will continue to remind us of
them please make these biscuits eat them
Anzac Day and any other time of the year
