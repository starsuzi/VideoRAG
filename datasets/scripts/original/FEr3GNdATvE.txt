my name is Al Savory I am the owner and
CEO of A1 mobile detailing we're based
out of North Ridge California we've been
in business for a little over 3 years
and we are eco-friendly today we're
going to show you how to remove tar uh
from a a car uh it's very tar is very
thick comes from uh miles and miles of
driving from the weather being rainy and
then dries up you get this film on your
vehicle that that's hard to come off uh
what I'm going to do today is I'm going
to use
uh a a couple products on there see
which one works the best uh you there's
two types that I'm going to use today
I'm going to use uh some gasoline on
there on a microfiber towel that pretty
much is going to break down the the the
top part uh and then I'm going to hit it
with some Degreaser again you can find a
Degreaser in any any store any auto
store uh basically it's going to break
down the rest of that and clean it up
real good so at this point I'm going
to put us some gas on a microfiber
towel and this is going to break it
down you want to go on the back and
forth
motion cuz the car goes in a back and
forth motion so everything is centered
going front to
back after applying the gas to it it's
breaking it breaking it
down then you will apply a little
degreaser
um again there's two ways of doing that
you can spray it on the body of the
vehicle or you can spray it on the
actual microfiber
towel again this this Degreaser is
concentrated um for stronger and more
stains you will use less
water um and then you'll apply this in
the same front to back
motion and that pretty
much takes off all
the tar
residue from the vehicle and leaving you
with a smooth
finish and you're back to normal
