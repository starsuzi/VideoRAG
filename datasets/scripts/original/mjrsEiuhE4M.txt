guys this is me andra 6751 and today i'm
gonna show you how to make an incubator
i already made two incubators but they
were not very well
but this is the best one that i made so
i'm gonna show you how to make it
and give you all the instructions that
you need about incubating the
temperature humidity and everything
so let's get started here are the things
you need
temperature and humidity gauge it's very
important to know the humidity
and this is the plastic
thing so you can put the water inside
to hold the humidity and sponge if you
want to it's not really
compulsory and this one aluminium foil
if your temperature is not rising you
can put this one
so it causes more heat and above
in this case i'm using 25 volts and this
metal net to protect the chickens from
the bulb
and the humidity that goes underneath
the incubator
so this is my box for the incubator and
now we're gonna get started to make it
first of all the thing i did was put a
bulb holder here
outside the incubator and then i put an
aluminium foil
to make it sit and all taped it so the
electricity doesn't go in the aluminium
then i cut a bunch of holes so because
of the air circulation and all
um i think 12 here and 15 there
i also cut these holes but the heat was
not so well that's why
i blocked them with the tape so first
thing we're gonna put the bulb
inside it's really easy
okay here we go and the second thing i'm
gonna put is this
aluminium foil inside the incubator
wherever it fits but i'm gonna put it
here
the third thing we're gonna put this
underneath the bulb
for good humidity and this is i'm gonna
show you this one later
then we're gonna put the net
make sure it fits i did all the
calculations
to fit it it took me about half an hour
and this is what it looks like then
we're gonna put this inside
you can put it anywhere but i'll put it
here
and the last thing you need the cover
and this straw and this cup is to
maintain the humidity because i don't
want to
pick the net up and put the water again
so i'll do it like this
just put the straw and put the water
inside so i don't
lose much heat and this is the cover
this is a fan 12 volt dc fan
so i put it like this above
and this is how it looks so
the fan is 12 volt so i also need a 12
volt adapter
i got this from alhabari because i live
in qatar you can't find these
things anywhere because you don't have
any electric electronic shops
this one you can adjust the voltage it
goes up to 12 volts from 1.5 volt to 12
volts
so you can adjust the voltage so now i'm
gonna turn my incubator on
this one you have different switches
with that you can also plug it in with a
piano
and the best thing is that i have the
dimmer for the burp so if the
temperature rises i can just
lower the temperature down so let me
just wire these things up
and show you there's my power supply
and this one oops sorry
i'm gonna plug it in and turn it on
so this is how it looks right now
the bulb is 40 volts and
the heat goes up to 93 volt 93 volts
and this one is a dimmer i'm going to
show you how it works
it's decreasing the light is decreasing
and as we
increase it the light increases so it's
good for
maintaining the temperature down and
above price the temperature and this is
the computer fan
i have it on 12 volts
and it works perfectly for air
circulation
and the holes are also perfect and the
towel
is for the softness when the chick
hatches and
this metal thing to protect the chick
from heat
this humidity gauge yeah now we get on
to the instructions
so the humidity should be 60 to 70 or 55
if you want the temperature can go
up to 100 but not beyond that because
the egg will fry and you'll turn the egg
twice a day
just you can just put cross and circle
the both sides so you remember which
side
you did which side you like bent
and you will turn the eggs
for 18 days but last three days you will
not turn the eggs because
the chick is about to hatch on 21 day
and you don't want to disturb the
incubation and
all so yeah that's how to make a
homemade incubator
thanks for watching
