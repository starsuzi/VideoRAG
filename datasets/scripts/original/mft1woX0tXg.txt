today we're gonna make Canadian Caesars
this is a traditional Canadian beverage
please make sure if you're making this
an alpha W that you do have your liquor
license otherwise it could be pulled as
illegal so the first thing we have to do
is squeeze some lemons and I have some
of them and juice here and then what you
do is you take celery salt we've put
ours in a bowl so it's easier to dip the
the class event so you dip it in them
remember juice and you Rim the glasses
you can really light or happy I do light
my husband hit me give him a heavy
the remaining lemon juice you pour it in
the bottom I took a little bit he takes
a lot then we put in some vodka now this
is Russian vodka so I'm not sure if you
can actually classify it as a Canadian
Caesar but maybe a mixture made this
close your secret because we're putting
in flashback say puts up like
then we're gonna spice it up first is
worship sir
we put it about seven or eight drops
then put in some Tabasco sauce and
depending on how spicy you like it
we kind of like ours average
and then the main ingredient Clamato
juice this is from Canada
shake your ass some Caesars you can add
in celery sticks we don't like that
because we just want to have our Caesar
so after this you add ice and you're
ready to go
