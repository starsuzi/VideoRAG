hi my name is Christina kusmich from
Christina kmit.com and today I want to
show you how to freeze leaks now if
you're not familiar with leaks they come
from the onion family and they are
delicious when sauteed so what we're
going to do first is get rid of this guy
right here the root you're going to
discard that and also we don't use the
dark green parts of the leak so I'm
going to cut that off you only want to
use the white
and the I'm actually even going to cut a
little more and the very very light
green part of the leak so we're going to
discard all that and now we're just
going to slice them like that now what
happens with leaks is a lot of dirt gets
stuck in there and it's hard to clean so
I'm going to show you a tip you're going
to throw these pieces of leak in
here and kind of push the little
rings
out and what's going to happen happen is
after it sits in this ice water all the
dirt is going to sink to the
bottom so let that sit for a little
while then you're going to take a
slotted
spoon plate lined with paper towels and
we're just going to gently again don't
Stir the Water cuz you're going to bring
that dirt up let it
dry and then what we're going to
do is take a baking
sheet and just place your little rings
on here make sure they're not touching
because instead of just throwing all
this in a plastic bag and freezing it
like that they're all going to stick
together this way they're going to
freeze
individually show you right here so
these are already Frozen and now when
you stick them in the bag you can just
take a few out they're not going to
stick together so plastic bag throw
these in
I'm going to use some of them for
tonight's dinner so I'm only
freezing few seal that
airtight and throw it in the freezer and
that's that I'm Christina kusich thanks
for watching
