Hi how are you it's me again I haven't
seen you guys in a long time I just
bought myself a cam um webcam to make
some more videos and see if you guys
like it well you know how in the fall we
have uh spiders and ants and all kinds
of stuff outside and as well as inside
your house but I just prefer if you have
kids you can put it outside not that
it's in
um no harm to them anyways but what
would you need these are the things that
you need because because uh they killed
the bugs and you save money and we
recycle a plastic bottle a water bottle
or any kind of plastic you can also do
it with a 2 L uh soda container or any
container that looks like uh a regular
bottle so here we
go what you need is a plastic container
like this this is a water bottle this is
the size that I want outside although
you can use the 2 L as well you need a
pair of scissors and you need some
wire and I like this wire this wire
happens to be up excuse me no matter
what I trust but anyways this happens to
be a wire that I like this is a floral
wire and the reason why I like it it's
because you can't really see it when you
hang it up and if you have Decor or a
deck or anything in your yard or front
porch that you don't want people to see
the the wire this is the best best way
to go if you want a thicker wire you can
do it as well when this fills up with
plugs what you do is just throw it away
so we'll continue what we need is like a
24
in wide of
wire and I'm going to cut the
wire like so it's like 24
in so here's the wire I have cut it now
I'm laying it down I hope you can see
it then you need a plastic bottle as
what I have here is a drinking bottle I
get these like for $3 $2.99 for a pack
of
24 and what you're going to do to make
it look better obviously is cut the
label
off so there goes now I just have the
bottle and this is what it looks like so
the next step you need to do is to take
the scissors and try to cut the half of
the length of the bottom stick it
in like this and I'm going to cut just
around be careful this is like not the
case to do this is really something that
if the scissors are too sharp you don't
want anybody C so make sure you be
careful with the scissors I have poked
myself offensive times with this so you
have the bottom part of the plastic
bottle and you have the top part so
we're going to need need the top part as
well as the bottom part so what you're
going to do is on each end each side of
the bottle you're going to make a hole
with the scissors and if you had a a
that would be better too because the a
just goes right through and be careful
you don't cut yourself so what we're
going to do is put the
wire through one the ho so that you'll
be able to see it and right across the
other side we're going to do
another hole here and then this wire is
going to
go this wire is just going to wait until
we put the top
on so the next step is to take the top
part and figure if it's going to be a
good fit to into the bottle so what I
like to do is cut it a little bit
shorter
like a half inch I would say
like that and then it looks like this
what you're going to do is take it
upside down and put it into the
Container like like I have done right
here and then I am going to
take I am going to
take and put the
wire okay so what I'm going to do
is like I said the wire came on so now I
have to find a
hole take this wire and just twist it up
I don't know if you can see what I'm
doing the main thing is to take the wire
and tie a knot or go around like I do
see see how I have it I don't know if
you can really see that I just wrap it
around like this the wire so what I'm
going to
do is put this
top backwards into the bottom of the
plastic and I'm going to go around to
the other
hole on the other
side I can find
this yes yes yes my blind
stuff and I'm going to pull it up here
and the reason why I took this out so
that I can show you so you see how I
have it here I don't even have to tie a
knot I just wrap the wire around like
this and it makes a nice
closure see like this so now I have like
a basket to hang you see like a basket
and then I'm going to put this in here
like this so when you put that together
that's upside down and what I'm going to
do now is make a little slit on the top
and a little slip on the other side just
where you have those little holes on
each side then you're going to take the
wire and slip it in where I had made a
slid and then the other side too this
way it can hang and hold on to this top
that we have formed here and what I'm
going to do is just twist the wire to
make twist the wire to make a hang so
you can hang it up
outside see so I have made like a
hanging thing you see how I hang this up
like
this like
this and then sorry about the
phone then what I'm going to do is add
some orange
juice and then the acidity of the orange
juice will
Hill the Flies and and spiders and
everything you have on the porch because
they love to drink it so what's going to
happen is they're going to go
inside the soda the top of the soda or
the water bottle
inside and not be able to come back out
so they're going to go and see this
orange juice and smell it and they're
going to go inside and drink the orange
juice that's in here and they're going
to get stck by the end of the week you
should see this all filled up with um
bugs and you can throw it away and do
many of them on the porch and they look
very nice and if you really wanted to
decorate you can you can put stickers on
it of butterflies or whatever you want
it to do and this is and this is how it
looks it hangs and it's
already and this kills the bugs thank
you and I hope you enjoyed um my uh
craft tutorial and to save on killing
the bugs on those nasty flies and moths
and and bugs on your porch thank you and
uh hope you stay tuned to my my other
videos and thank you very much bye-bye
