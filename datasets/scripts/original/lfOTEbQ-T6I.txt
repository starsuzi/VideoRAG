hello YouTube and welcome to my kitchen
today I will be cooking oven fried
chicken let's get started first we will
need panco breadcrumbs about 2 lbs of
chicken slightly beaten
egg and an oil
spray okay so in
the slightly beaten egg I've added black
pepper and garlic powder and these are
hanco bread crumbs that has been
seasoned the first thing you want to
do is pour your egg mixture over your
chicken then you want to take Clean
Hands and spread the mixture all over
the chicken
evenly we made sure our chicken was
evenly coated with the egg
mixture next we're going to dredge the
chicken in the pan of bread crumb
okay so the next step in this process
will be to oil our
pan we're going to take our oil spray
make sure our pan is evenly
coated then we're going to take our
chicken Shake any excess egg off we're
going to dredge it in the panco
breadcrumbs
make sure it is evenly
coated shake
off and lay it in the
pan dredge
it shake
off and lay it in the pan you will
continue to do this until you have
dredged all your
chicken right now you want to go ahead
on and heat your oven up to 400° now
that all the the chicken has been
dredged one trick is to spray the top
with the oil spray and put it in the
oven at 400° spraying the oil spray on
the chicken will make it extra crispy
taking a taking a quick peek at the
chicken in the oven looks like it's come
along well just a few more
minutes our chicken is now done and here
are the results crisp oven fried
chicken
