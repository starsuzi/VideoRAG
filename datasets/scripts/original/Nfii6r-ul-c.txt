long ago when man first discovered fire
he had no idea of the magnitude of the
power that might one day
[Music]
com today we're going to make some
magnificent colored Flames now this is
very easy to do all we need is some
methanol which we can get at the auto
part store next some epson salts which
is better known as magnesium sulfate
also no salt which has potassium
chloride SL bitartrate in it and also
boric acid known as borax grocery
store so to kick this one off we're just
going to pour the EP some salts in here
and this is just to demonstrate what it
looks like as a very bright white
flame now I say white but in reality
it's going to look kind of orange but if
you compare it to a regular fire then
you would see the difference
so once we get it all mixed up and
stirred here let's set it a
[Music]
blaze as you can see it's pretty
[Music]
bright now all the potassium content in
this once we mix it up and get it going
is going to create a nice blue or Violet
flame depending on how your eyes work
once we get it all mixed up let's uh you
know Stir It in and you know get it
going and then let's set it a blaze as
[Music]
well as you can see it's a kind of a
blue or Violet flame very easy to
[Music]
do and finally my favorite take a couple
spoonfuls of borax and then pour in your
methanol
[Music]
careful
here now Stir It Up mix it up whatever
you want to say here and set it a
blaze as the boric acid burns off
creates a nice green
flame all right let's go through it so
what do we have here magnesium sulfate
Burns nice and bright boric acid burns
nice and green and potassium chlorate SL
bitartrate burs nice blue and
violety see you next week
