hello and welcome back to the road to
good cooking last weekend I made a super
tasty s dish roasted red cabbage steaks
that I served with my favorite chicken
wings glaze with a sweet and savory
hully hulie sauce it was to die for good
and to make my cabbage St taste even
better I added a dollop of blue cheese
dressing on the top and it was delicious
you can't go wrong with this Hardy side
dish now let me show you how I made my
roasted red cabbage steaks I started
with one mediumsized red cabbage I love
to use red cabbage because it has 10
times more vitamin A and twice as much
iron as green cabbage and I'm going to
season my cabbage with a lepo pepper
flakes garlic infused olive oil and my
SPG mix that salt pepper and granulated
garlic mix I always remove the first
layer of my cabbage I'm going to rinse
it with cold water and Pat it
dry
[Music]
I sliced the bottom of my cabbage so it
will set firmly on my cutting
board I slic my cabbage steaks in about
half in thick
SLI you can cut your cabbage steak as
thick or as thin as you like
it
[Music]
and make sure you leave that stem in
there because that will keep your steaks
um intact and keep it from falling apart
on you during the cooking
[Music]
process
[Music]
here I'm oiling my 9x12 baking sheet
with my garlic infused olive
[Music]
oil I'm going to coat both sides of my
cabbage steak with the olive
oil make sure you rub it in real good to
get in all those little nooks and
crannies and all around the
[Music]
edges
[Music]
I'm sprinkling my Aleppo pepper flakes
over all of my cabbage steaks and I'm
going to sprinkle them with my SPG mix
and then flip them over and repeat the
process my cabbage steaks are going into
a 350° oven for 20 minutes then I'm
going to flip them over and continue
cooking them for another 20 minutes
until they are golden brown and
delicious look at those Beauties oh so
pretty so pretty and so very
tasty while I'm waiting for my cabbage
steaks to get done I'm going to make
myself a dirty Sue Martini I don't know
who dirty Sue is but she sure does make
a good dirty martini now it's going to
start off with 3 oz of dry Jin and 1/2
oz of the dirty Sue mix I'm going to put
them in my um Shaker I'm going to shake
it not Stir It I have some ice in
[Music]
here pour it over the ice and
[Music]
Shake
[Music]
I have two of the blue cheese stuffed
olives in a nice cooled martini glass
and I'm going to pour my dirty martini
in this glass oo that is so
[Music]
good
blue cheese stuffed olives which are
amazing let me give it a little
[Music]
taste oh oh yeah that's the ticket right
[Music]
there you're going to love the dirty Sue
because the recipe is right on the side
of the jar here I use 3 oz of the Vodka
1/2 oz of the dirty soue olive juice and
I shaked it and poured it over
uh some imported in my martini glass and
I garnished with two olives and it is to
die for a good I think there might be
one more in the making
[Music]
here yum you're going to love
these I found this dirty Sue martini mix
at the um my local Le's Market here and
I tell you what it's good my cabbage has
been cooking for about 20 minutes on
this side now I'm going to flip them
over and as you can see I have a little
bit of brownness there and it's not
golden brown like I said earlier but it
is going to be slightly Brown any rate
um so I'm going to flip it over and put
it back in the in my 350° oven for
another 20 minutes and then it'll be
time for dinner now gently flip them
over because you want to keep everything
intact see like I'm starting to lose
some of the leaves around the edges here
but that's okay just you know Pat it
back in there and leave it alone and um
just you know grab them as best you can
and uh try to keep the leaves on there
because those leaves around the edges oh
my Lord those taste so good because they
get nice and crunchy around the edges
okay it is time to eat my steak is done
let me sample I've been tasting it oh it
is so good still has the crispy crunch
to it it's savoring you will not be
disappointed with this recipe now every
time I make it I make it with a
different dressing on the top by far my
favorite dressing is this blue cheese
I've tried it with um ranch dressing
sour cream it's good either
way I haven't even dug into my chicken
wings yet those are my favorite
too holy holy chicken wings who
knew and as you can see it is gone I'm
done everything was delicious this
