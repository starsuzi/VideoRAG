- This is a watermelon.
Watermelons have a very
unique feature about them.
They are able to retain almost
any liquid that you add to it.
So once you cut a hole in,
and you stick a bottle of whatever in,
it eventually seeps into the watermelon.
So what we can do is,
we can put in vodka, rum,
gin, tequila, triple sec.
The basic ingredients for
a long island iced tea.
Creating ladies and gentlemen,
ok get real intellectual with this,
the long island iced tea watermelon.
Never been done before!
First we have to fill these small bottles.
(liquid pouring)
We can take the cap off of
one of our smaller bottles
and we can make a circle
where we can put a hole.
Need five of them.
Got to know how to handle a blade boys.
Watch me cut myself
right after I say that.
Ohh look at that.
- Here want a turn?
- Yeah.
- Slip it in this hole.
Don't let it spill, just
pour it in real quick.
Go!
Now force it in.
She weighs half.
Now put your finger over
the top, and then just
like pull back at the last...
- Like this?
- Yeah, at the last minute.
Right, perfect.
She weighs half too!
I had the triple sec.
Ladies and gentlemen watch how you...
Oh my God, yeah do they go in there fast.
Ha looks like something
off a mutant planet right?
