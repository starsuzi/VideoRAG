okay let's get
started occasionally I like to clean the
ball tray to remove the cleaner
residue
now gather the pool
balls I got this tray from a Home Depot
tool box it does the
trick apply cleaner to all the pull
balls I use aramith cleaner it both
cleans and polishes it works well and is
relatively inexpensive I bought mine on
Amazon and actually paid $2 more than it
is right
now
while we wait for the polish to dry to a
haze we need to clean the wood on the
pool
table to get rid of the chalk
dust I use Pledge any good wood cleaner
will
do I apply it directly into an old shirt
Rag and don't ever spray directly on the
wood you can overspray and stain the
felt now the ball should be dry so put
eight balls in the auto
polisher run it for about 3 to five
minutes I took an old two gallon bucket
and taped a bonnet Pat to the bottom and
I let that run for the last couple of
minutes uh it just helps put a little
pressure on the balls and and polishes
them better while that's being done
let's clean the pull table felt brush
the heavily chalked areas while
constantly cleaning the brush with the
microfiber towel
and transferring the chalk dust to the
towel they claim you don't really have
to brush the table but I like to do it
the products you will use to clean it
would be quick
clean the microfiber brush a microfiber
towel uh the small microfiber brush you
can use a towel I just happen to have
this and as previous mentioned uh the
towel to wipe off the brush and under
the
rails buy the kit from the quick clean
website it ends up being cheaper spray
the whole table from about 2 feet high
with the quick clean making sure you
overlap the
rails wipe the table with the microfiber
brush
making four passes as shown and as
quickly and thoroughly as
possible wipe the brush after every
pass and make sure to overlap is
shown now wipe off the wood and the top
of the cushions
now take a microfiber
towel can wipe under the
cushions the table is
done it's time to remove the pull balls
take them balls out give them a quick
wipe if you'd like and then throw them
back in a
tray put in the remaining
balls run for about 3 to 5
minutes and uh while you're doing that
you can actually vacuum around the pool
table and you're all
done
