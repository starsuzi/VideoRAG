go hi I'm Adrian at City Kitty and this
is Ruby and her cat patients patience
was born in 1995 and we're gonna tell
everybody how to clean cat's ears today
aren't we
uh huh okay come on patience
so cleaning your cat's ears at home is
very simple to do
yes and
it causes a lot more
comfort for the cat if you can keep the
ears clean and it's a healthier ear so
it's important to keep the ears cleaned
okay so they do make several
otic solutions to clean your cat's ears
in the pet stores or you can just use
plain rubbing alcohol
so today what we're going to do is use a
cotton pad I'm going to fold her ear
back
and we're just going to wipe all the
external part
and they're a lot more comfortable too
like I said and you can see the dirt
that's coming out of the air
older cats especially build up a lot of
wax you see that Ruby look at that
foreign
yeah now this is something you can do
Ruby
yeah and it's my mom's cat yeah and you
can help clean her ears too yes and I
think I also feed her special little
treats that are soft because she hadn't
been taken some of her teeth had it been
took and
out
out from the vet yeah and look at all
that dirt Ruby
so she'll feel a lot better when we get
her ears clean
so make sure you get the all the dirt on
the flap here you see this flat part
that's the inside of her ear
we're gonna get all this clean
and then using a Q-tip just go into all
the parts you can see
a cat's eardrum is on a 90 degree angle
so it goes in and over like that but you
still try jumping off
she'll be pretty good she's a pro here
she's been here so many times Ruby and
she says meow a lot she does say meow a
lot she's talking
and you can see I'm getting quite a bit
of I can tell her when she is
of debris look at that Ruby oh yeah
but we have
we have things in our ears but we but
we'd rather we do different things for
us well do you use a Q-tip in your ear
nope oh I'd rather take a shower and I
said because I'd rather take a shower
and then I'd rather go and
and sometimes I don't like it when a bar
goes in my ear but it probably just
watches the stuff we have
yeah the cats don't like water in their
ear either so we're very careful when we
give the cats a bath so that the water
doesn't go in their ear or else they go
yeah so now
the otic solution it also dries out the
ear if there's any moisture in there a
couple things to look for in their ear
is if you see like a gooey [ __ ]
substance coming out sometimes that
could be a fungal infection due to many
causes
um usually allergies
or if you see a dark brown coffee
grounds like granules coming out that's
sometimes a sign of ear mites although
only a vet can truly diagnose that under
a microscope to see those microscopic
mites that go in the ear when you're
cleaning the cat's ear
it does really benefit
to see the condition of the ear and also
you can find out if there are any
anything
in the ear that a vet needs to see and
mites are little tiny bugs
and they also feed off of the debris
that's in the ear and they almost look
like a little tick they have six legs
and they are as big as a grain of sand
and you can see that
and this Kitty is doing so good
so she was born in 1995. so she's
getting up there she's kind of a grandma
isn't she Ruby yeah I'm petting her back
position that's good that makes her calm
doesn't it when you're petting her they
like that yeah they like it she likes it
most on her head because she got her
hair trimmed in this line she did we
trimmed her hair one time today she's
just gonna get a bubble bath
but these yeah you know one thing I
noticed the older kitties they really
get a lot of dirt in their ears this is
a really old Kitty Kitty she is 18 years
old oh my goodness yeah and she does so
good doesn't she yeah she's been here so
many times she has but she's meowing out
okay do you want to hold her and say
goodbye to everybody
uh I'm gonna order yeah you can hold her
and pet her okay this is Ruby patience
and I'm Adrian from City Kitty and say
bye bye thanks for
