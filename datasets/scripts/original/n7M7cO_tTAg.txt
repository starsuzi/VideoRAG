a lot of time I get lots of queries and
requests from my blog readers as well as
viewers so I decided from now on I'll be
answering your queries and honoring your
requests also so for today's video I am
going to show you
and easy peasy and a lovely DIY
because the query of this month is this
[Music]
I have water-based glass painting color
which means we can add water to dilute
it and the other one second variety I
have is solvent based which means we
have to add thinner to dilute the color
foreign
starting with water-based pink color and
I am using it as is which means I didn't
add water in it I'm using it
concentrated and I just poured enough
amount
and now I am spreading it inside the
bottle evenly and I'll keep doing so
until the entire bottle is dent
[Music]
once the bottle is stained I'll put it
upside down on a tissue or cloth now I
am using this mason jar and I am using
solvent based green color so that you
can see the difference
and I'm using it as is
and following the same procedure as I
did earlier
[Music]
this bottle I am staining with water
based yellow glass color and I add
little water in it so that it spreads
easily inside the bottle and the color
is lighter
foreign
[Music]
something different for this bottle
first I'll cut this metal ring
I have decided to paint it from outside
as I told you I have two methods of
staining the glass bottle first was
painting it from inside and the second
one is painting it from outside which I
really don't like much because brush
Strokes are easily visible and they
really don't look good this is not a
cool idea to stain glass bottles but
still I'm showing you and here I have
added some twist I am using this glue
gun in making some pattern on the glass
bottle
[Music]
beaded kind of pattern and on this I'll
I'll paint it so there when you wipe the
bottle it doesn't come out
it will stick on the bottle because of
paint
[Music]
here I am staining the bottle from
outside
the only advantage of staining the
bottle from outside is that you can use
it as vast because you can fill water
inside it
there is if you stain it from inside
then water can spoil the color the color
will easily come off so that's not a
good idea and here you can see the what
brush Strokes easily
