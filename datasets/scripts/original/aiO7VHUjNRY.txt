how do you take care of your new flute
most student fruits are silver plated
it's very important that you clean your
flute every time you finish playing if
you get into the habit of it right from
the start it really doesn't take longer
than about two minutes to do
the reason it's so important to clean
your food is that
our sweat
has acid in it and if the acid stays on
the flute then it tends to eat through
the silver it doesn't affect the sound
but it just doesn't look nice if you've
got bits of metal
coming through the silver so it's very
important to make sure that you take all
your fingerprints off the fruit
when you blow into the frigid create
some moisture inside the instrument and
if it's in the box after you finish
painting you haven't cleaned the
moisture out if the box turns upside
down the moisture is going to land up on
those pads
and the pad will swell and when it dries
it will shrink and if it's doing that
too much it's going to damage the pad
which is going to mean an expensive
repair so it's really quite simple
your
foods that when you buy your food will
come with a cleaning rod
and a cleaning cloth
for the inside and then one for the
outside
so all you need to do
is
to
make sure that the moisture is out of
the inside of the fruit simple as that
and then you take your cloth that cleans
the outside
and
make sure that all your fingerprints
wonderful
how easy is that
now if your flute didn't come with a
cleaning cloth or a cleaning rod
any music shop
sells these they sell them separately
you can just use a man's handkerchief
for that yes and how much would they
cost approximately these are a special
plus that we use
for the outside they have impregnated
into the cloth silver
we advise that you don't use any kind of
silver liquid
to clean your food because
when it dries to that white part if it
gets into the mechanism
it just clamps up the keys so we don't
want to put anything we don't grease the
flute we don't oil the flues no so no
soap
really it's just these two cloths and
what about putting your flute in the
bath
would that be a no-no
don't all the microwave i've had i've
had people walk away the hot flute
to kill germs
ready
don't do it
so if you do want to kill the germs if
you've got a really dirty flute what
would you say well really for the
outside
just the cloth for the inside a
handkerchief if you are worried about
germs on the head joint you do get
little swabs which have got alcohol in
them or you could just use alcohol and
just clean what sort of alcohol would
you recommend
wine
brandy
we've got them in little they're coming
sachets i think for children it's
probably why just to buy the sachets
um
we use them in the shop because we have
people trying out our foods all the time
and so we need to make sure that we
don't spread germs so excellent
and
i think that's an amazing thing to learn
because
we do so much damage to instruments that
end up costing us a lot more money to
take care of later on and our foods
don't sound so well do they when they're
blocked up and clogged up and they don't
work
