hi guys today I have a really easy
recipe for you on how to make your own
bug repellent lotion and this is
kid-friendly you just need very few
ingredients I'm going to use 1/3 cup of
coconut oil I'm using organic unrefined
virgin coconut oil I bought this at
Target you could find it at grocery
stores and then you're going to use 15
drops of an essential oil I'm using
lavender from um Mountain Rose herbs.com
and then a container I have to put the
lotion in so first I'm going to take my
thir cup of coconut oil and I'm going to
put it in a microwave safe dish and I'm
going to microwave it for about 10
seconds just to get it really soft it's
already pretty soft because it is warm
in my house but I want to make sure it's
easy to mix so here it is warmed
up I'm just going to add my 15 drops of
essential oil you can use peppermint
lavender or clove those are some really
good fragrances that will repel
mosquitoes and other
insects
and that's it you're just going to mix
it really well and you're going to store
it in your container I like to keep mine
in the fridge so it's more of a lotion
SL solid form if you leave it out on the
counter it will be pretty runny and if
you leave it outside it will completely
get liquidy if it's warm
out and I have tested this and it does
work really good on my sun I use
lavender because it's widely used as an
a repellent against mosquitoes and I
like the smell of it and you could
directly apply it to to your
skin so thanks so much for watching I'm
going to also post a video of um bug
spray the spray version which is a
little bit different I will post a link
below if you want to check that out
thanks so much for watching bye
guys
