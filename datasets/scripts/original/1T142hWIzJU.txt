I use a medium hot gas flame and I set
the cheese cake directly on top of the
burner I twist the cheesecake over the
burner about 10 to 15 seconds warming
the sides and the bottom of the pan just
enough to gluten the cold
butter and that's it step
one to remove the cheesecake from the
warm pan I Elevate the pan a bit above
the
countertop I put both thumbs on the top
rim of the pan and my other fingers on
the pan
bottom I push the pan bottom up with
both of my hands I transfer my left hand
to the center of the pan bottom
balancing the cake and I pull the cheese
cake pan down as I transfer the cake to
my right hand and that's it step
two try this alternative for removing a
cold cheesecake from the warm pan I use
an upside down empty sour cream
container this happens to be a 3 lb nson
sour cream container but you can use any
sturdy container the circumference is
about 5 in I set the pan on top I can
just leave it there if I
want I put my fingers on the pan bottom
and my thumbs on the pan Edge and I push
with my thumbs down just like
that pull it straight down carefully
there you go it's
off
