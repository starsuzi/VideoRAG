HOW TO REMOVE MUSTARD STAINS FROM CARPET
When you discover the mustard stain, the last
thing you want to do is aggressively scrub
the stain.
Instead, take a clean cloth and blot the stain
gently to remove as much mustard as possible.
Blot the stained area of the carpet with a
solution made of 2 cups of warm water and
1 teaspoon of liquid dish soap until no more
mustard comes out.
In a separate bowl, mix 3 parts liquid dish
soap and 1 part hydrogen peroxide.
Spread the paste onto the affected area of
the carpet.
Using a steam iron on its lowest setting,
hold it over the spot for 30 to 60 seconds
to loosen up the stain.
Next, dip a clean towel into cold water and
continue blotting the carpet fibers to lift
off any remaining mustard residue.
Pat dry the area with a dry, clean cloth
Another method is pour club soda directly
onto the mustard stain and blot it with a
clean towel.
If the mustard stain is still visible, blot
the stain with a mixture of 1 teaspoon of
detergent and 2 cups of warm water.
Let this solution soak into the carpet for
5 minutes.
Rinse the carpet with cold water and blot
dry or vacuum any moisture.
