so the first thing we're going to do to
make these pajamas is cut out the
pattern piece so we have to trace over
something that already fits our child
leaving enough room for seam allowance
and at the top to put the elastic
in now we need to cut two for the front
and two for the back so there will be
two of opposite so basically turn the
fabric so that the right side is down
and then the right side is up so that
you have two of
[Music]
each I am making the front and back
pieces of the shorts by lining them up
right sides together and pinning down
the center seam and then I will go over
to my machine and sew the center seam
[Music]
and I'm going to be matching it up the
front and the back right sides together
and sewing down the sides
[Music]
[Music]
and next I'm going to be sewing up the
crotch so I put a pen to line up the
front seam to the back seam and then
just sew all the way around from one leg
over to the
other then I bring it over to my serger
to finish up all those raw edges you
could also use a zigzag Stitch and now
I'm ironing down the waistband to make
room for my elastic making sure it's
straight and has plenty of room to put
um however thick of elastic you want
through it so I sew it all the way
around I measured the elastic earlier by
um wrapping it around my child to see
what size they were and I add a very
large safety pin the bigger the better
as far as pulling it through faster
and I work that elastic just all the way
through until I can bring it out the
other side and then I sew the
piece um each piece making sure that
they are not overlapping in a weird way
like twisting anything and then I sew
them together I actually sew in more
than one spot so that I'm sure um it
won't come
[Music]
loose next I just sew up that area that
I like left open to pull the elastic
through to kind of finish it off making
sure a back and forward
[Music]
Stitch okay so I cut these out in such a
way that you shouldn't have to hem the
bottom if you cut it right because we
cut it to where the sheet was actually
hemmed already but I found that I cut
them too long so I found myself having
to rehem them to the right size for my
daughter so I basically just um pressed
it an inch and another inch to hide the
raw Edge inside and went around with um
a seam I think I did about an inch cuz I
like wide
seams now I'm going to show you how to
make the pajama top I have a whole set
of measurements on the blog for
different sizes for this particular set
it was for my 7-year-old daughter so I
cut this one 20 in wide and 19 in long I
made sure to cut two because I'm going
have to sew the front to the back
um I also used the pattern piece from
the blog to cut the little arm
areas I then brought both pieces over to
my machine and lined up the side seams
and sewed both side seams right sides
[Music]
together I took the top over to my
ironing board to make a casing for the
elastic pressing it a half inch down and
another half inch and repeating on the
other
side I sewed down my elastic casing with
about a/ in seam on both sides
[Music]
I measure two 8 in pieces of4 in elastic
and then put a safety pin through it to
bring it through my
[Music]
casing when my elastic was almost
through I secured it with a pin to be
sure it didn't come all the way through
so I could sew it in
[Music]
place I then added the elastic with the
safety pin to the back side of the shirt
pinned it in place and then stitched in
all four spots to keep the elastic in
place
[Music]
the last step in the project is to
create the straps so I measured two 18in
pieces of some thin double fold bias
tape and starting at the arm
seam I sandwiched the raw Edge between
the bias tape sewing it and then um
pulling it all the way up and over and
lining up the other side like I'm doing
here and then sew all the way around
even top stitching the top part and the
two end pieces meet in the middle seam
at the
arm this step can be a little bit tricky
but if you use the thicker bias tape
it is definitely a lot easier you can
also use pins to make sure they meet in
the middle at the seam after you have
your straps all done this is an
excellent time to add some eyelet or
lace or any other little Sweet
Embellishments anywhere that you want to
