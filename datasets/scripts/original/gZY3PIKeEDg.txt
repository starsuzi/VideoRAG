Yeah
So this is our Mexican street corn.
Ahh.
This stuff is awesome.
It's addicting.
This is a great side to go with brisket,
pork loin, anything you might be barbecuing.
So we have Cotija cheese.
We have-
Or you could use asadero, or queso fresco,
any crumbly mild cheese.
Mayonnaise.
Got a little garlic going in too.
Little mayo, oh, gimme that.
Now you don't know me,
but I know how to grate some garlic.
I don't wanna lose a fingernail.
(audience laughter)
That's how you grate some garlic.
There you go, there you go, woo.
There you go.
All right.
Chili powder.
Mmm.
Here we go.
One diced jalapeno.
Jalapeno, yep.
Onion.
Little onion,
little red onion.
Looking pretty yummy from here.
And then, we're gonna add in the corn.
Oh you got some some nice crust.
You developed the sugars in that.
Charred it first.
Charred that, get the sugars going.
OK, then we're gonna stir that in.
Yes.
(audience applause)
And then, then just add a little salt and pepper to taste.
Salt and pepper, yum and yum.
Good job.
There we go, good job.
