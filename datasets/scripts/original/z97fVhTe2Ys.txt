hey folks it's 1881 MF we're on the life
busz and channel here got Little Debbie
does run the camera for us and I don't
know if you can see this or not but this
is homemade
vanilla and it is the best vanilla
you'll ever buy so I'm going to show you
how to do it it's real easy okay start
with your cheap vodka filtered the way I
did if you haven't seen that check out
that video it's pretty cool
so we're going to start with
that we're going to start with vanilla
beans get the grocery store they're not
cheap these vanilla beans are going to
cost you three or four bucks a piece I
bet you so I take these
beans and they're kind of sticky don't
handle them too much because you want
all that love to be shared and then just
slice right down the middle oh it's
almost like a prune consistency I forgot
about the slicing yeah so we're going to
good tip good tip slice this Sky all the
way down the
middle just like
that now we're going to do the same
thing on this other
one nice cutting board hey yeah check
out that video too where'd you get that
cutting board I made that you can see a
video on it I think it's just beautiful
okay so we cut
these and if you look in there there see
all that Bean Juice in there that's what
makes all that vanilla extract really
good
so here we go drop it in your
vodka and put a lid on
it and let it sit for 6 months to a year
I know it sucks but if you do it right
now in a year you'll have
this that you'll never ever uses that
much van you never use that much vanilla
so you take bottles like this and you
fill it up and you give them away for
Christmas gifts so there you go be the
first one to get next year's Christmas
gifts already done with your homemade
vanilla extract and you cook with it the
normal way you would any other vanilla
extract it burns away when you cook it
so there's no alcohol it has a wonderful
Aroma with this you only need half as
much as what the recipe calls but I like
vanilla extra so much I use it we use it
for everything so you make it once it
lasts forever leave vanilla bean in
there if you choose and it'll continue
to get better and stronger over the
years so try it it's great cheap
vodka filter
it vanilla beans sliced dropped in your
cheap vodka let it sit for 6 months to a
year and you're ready to go so 1881 MF
