people like to make videos of what's in
their grooming totes but sometimes I
wonder if that's really what's in their
grooming tote or if they made it better
than what they usually have because
they're on YouTube hi everyone I'm Lisa
from budget equestrian.com where I share
different ideas with you for you to make
the most of the time that you have with
your horse and I wanted to do kind of a
different video for you today this is
going to be kind of fun I want to show
you what's in my grooming totes but I'm
just going to show you what's inside of
each grooming tote that I have I haven't
preempted this I haven't edited this in
any way we're just going to go through
and see what's in my grooming totes and
I'll show you what I use on my horses
it's going to be fun so we're going to
start with the purple one cuz that's in
the front
so I have my homemade
Shi I have a homemade sheep skin rubber
egg baby wipes because they work great
for cleaning out noses and cleaning off
eyes microfiber
towel main comb Main
brush one of my personalized brushes for
frisbee a brush that I don't usually
ever
use oh that's my magic
groomer this is a scrub
brush that has a sponge in it and I
haven't had really good use of this I
didn't really like it so I think that's
going to go out of my out of my grooming
tote another sheep skin rub rag that I
made my
gloves this is a nice brush I like this
it has like raised edges the center is a
little bit lower it's dirty can you see
the dust and then it's got a really nice
backing on it this is a stuen brush I
really really like this
brush some vet
wrap a latch
hook some
twine that's going to throw away use
baby
wipes this is my a whisker trimmer that
I got in one of the hearts of horse
boxes I've used it on Frisbee's tail and
on their whiskers too this one's about
dead so I think I'm going to toss
that an equestra brush this is a nice
flicker brush flick brush I like this
brush a
lot this is my favorite brush for making
my horses shiny this is the hos Diva
brush it has sheep skin on the inside
and bristles on the outside this is a
really really nice brush it's expensive
I think it was like 35 bucks for this
version but they do have cheaper
ones more more dried out baby
wipes a little comb that works good for
mains
Subway knife those are good to have
around and that is it for this grooming
tote so we're going to put this one down
and go on to the next one so in the next
grooming tote I've got another hos brush
I like the ones with
the that you can put your hand through I
like that a lot that's a nice brush but
I left it sitting like this in the groom
tote so it crunched my bristles down so
I need to make sure that I leave it
sitting like this so it doesn't crimp
the
bristles I have some moisturizing Shine
Serum some Dollar Store baby powder that
I got for Frisbee's white
socks some wound spray this stuff works
pretty
good
this is a staple for me this is a rubber
Curry and I use this to knock the dirt
out of my brushes when I'm
[Music]
grooming like that it works really good
to keep the dust out of your
brushes and I've used this a lot so the
Nubs are really worn down and it also
works good to get dried mud off and it
doesn't hurt
them
woo some rain maker that needs to be
clean look I'm that's
bad another hos brush this is the lipaz
oner brush that's my husband got me that
for Christmas that's a really nice brush
too some wall Clipper oil very important
if you have clippers for your
horses
some Twinkle Toes hoof
polish it has little
stars I like
it another body brush with the strap for
your hand I like that cuz you can really
flick it good when you're brushing them
and it has a fun little pattern on it
can you see the
pattern some petroleum
jelly I got got that at the dollar store
too some scissors for
trimming these are just scissors I think
I got these at Target for like $14 I use
it for trimming Ms and banging off their
tails too on the bottom of their
tails my homemade shedding
blade a container of stall fly spree
which is basically white vinegar in here
right now
[Music]
now a hoof
knife that I've never
used best wound gel in the entire world
this is silver Zorb
gel this I use this where most people
use neosporin I use
this a pulling comb that I use pretty
much only for coing I don't use it for
technically pulling their mans I don't
like to pull their MS some citronella
essential
oil some
tape and
[Music]
trash so that's grooming tote number
two empty so the third and final
grooming
tote this stuff is incredible this is
MTG main tail groom and this helps with
dermatitis and different skin issues it
also is supposed to help your hores man
and tail grow faster you just put a
couple of drops on this on the dock of
their tail or right on the base of their
man and you only have to do it like
every other day and it helps to it helps
the hair to grow faster I also have been
using this on Ethan because he has like
these sarcoid fungus wart things on his
neck
so I put this on it every other day and
it is helping those to
shrink I have some fly spray that's
really important right
[Music]
now oh and my favorite Pony Glam this is
Sassy silver I love Pony Glam it's a
hoof conditioner it gives them some
shine isn't that
pretty and it gives them some bling but
it's not a hoof polish so it doesn't get
hard and dry out their Hooves it keeps
them soft and right now it's really
runny because it's really warm outside
but this stuff is really fun it comes in
lots of different colors another
rag my most favorite Main and tail brush
this is tail Tamer I got this in one of
the heart to horse boxes I love this
brush it's so
fun Frisbee's brush that I made for him
[Music]
Ethan's brush that I personalized for
him I use this brush a lot a lot cuz
it's more stiff bristles and it really
helps to get the dirt and dust off of
them in fast
way there Frisbee's brush this is a
really stiff
brush and it's kind of like a mud brush
it really works gets the mud off of them
I like this brush a
lot well hoof Peck
some fungus oil ointment again that's
for Ethan this stuff didn't work that
good but it helps to treat fungal and
bacterial skin conditions on animals
horses but I haven't had good success
with
this a spray bottle this is one of those
fancy spray
bottles it sprays a long time so you
don't have to keep squirting it and this
is for mainly
long hair so this is supposed to help
your horse's mane and tail grow really
fast and stay really
strong I really like this brush but the
nails came out so I took the little hand
strap off but it's a really really soft
brush dirty too but I use that to get
some shine on the
ponies a lovely sweat scraper this thing
is really nice because it has a rubber
Edge on it so it really works works good
to get the excess water off after I've
bathed
them this is a brush that doesn't work
the greatest it's okay but this was
another one that was in the heart to
horse
box I have
a feather blade this is a razor blade
with a guard on it I use that for
thinning out
Mains I also use it to cut my own bangs
this thing is pretty
cool more used wet
wipes bit
butter this stuff is so nice so what you
do you put bit butter on the sides of
your horse's mouth and on the edges of
the bit before you put it in his mouth
and it smells really good it's made from
beeswax peppermint oil mango fruit
butter cocoa butter shea butter vitamin
E and soybean oil and what it does is it
it's kind of like ChapStick for your
horse's mouth and it helps to soften it
and it actually helps them with the bit
I got this for Frisbee and I love it so
I use this all the time now when I ride
and this is some shapley high gloss
finishing
spray I'm not too crazy about it it's
supposed to make them look super shiny
I've actually had just as good of
results of making them shiny
with my homemade
show and a pair
of handson grooming gloves these are
like a curry they have different
patterns on them so it's like it gives
your horse a
massage you wear them like
gloves and say hello
ponies
so it's a curry comb on a
glove and I've heard they come in colors
now which is cool and another sheep skin
rubber I
made and that's it so now I'm going to
put everything back where it
[Music]
belongs
[Music]
[Music]
so that was it that's what I have in my
grooming totes that's what I these are
what I take out when I'm going out to
play with my my horses I probably don't
need to take all three of them I could
probably downsize just into one but if I
just grab any of them I'm good to go I
seem to collect horse brushes and stuff
so I like having three thank you so much

you subscribe to my channel I upload new
videos every Monday Wednesday and Friday
