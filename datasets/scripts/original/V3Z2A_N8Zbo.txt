all right let's make some chicken wings
I got um eight wings I cut the tips off
of them cut them into pieces tips I just
threw in the freezer um and what I got
here I got some soy
sauce not too much just just little
marinade
here going take some garlic
powder little black pepper
little sea
salt and I got about half a tablespoon
of sugar it's going to help caramelize
them cuz we're not going to fry deep fry
these we're going to pan fry
these we're going to mix this up and let
them set for about half an hour all
right let's start cooking our wings
now take a little oil
now I'm I'm only using medium heat right
now because I want to kind of cook
these anyway I'm using medium heat we're
going to Brown them up a little bit
all right now it take put some chili
flakes on
here how many and H hot it's all up to
you little
soy and we're going to take some soda
probably used about 12
oz now we're going to crank this heat up
a little
bit and we're going to condense that
soda
down and that'll make a nice syrupy
glaze for our
wings all right just a little update
we're still cooking down our sauce
really what we're doing is we're brazing
the wings in this and this Dr Pepper and
we're just going to keep cooking them
down till this sauce gets to be real
thick and then anyway we're just cooking
them down all right our Brazen liquid is
really starting to cook down now so
we're getting
close just keep moving them
around all right our sauce is getting
real thick now
just going to keep moving
around remember there's a lot of sugar
in
here let it set too long it'll burn
let's turn the heat
off all right now that took about 30
minutes just just so you have a time
