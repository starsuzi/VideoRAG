pattern because the cable you will need
either a cable needle or a double
pointed needle
so this pattern is worked on 24 stitches
for just the cable then you put it on a
background of reverse stockinette so I
have 10 reverse stockinette on either
side of my 24 stitch cable so to get
started on the right side of your work
you're going to purl your reverse
stockinette
so now for Row one of the cable you're
gonna start off by purling two
then you're going to do a cable 4 back

stitches onto your cable needle or
double pointed needle and you're going

see how yours turned out make sure you
learn this stitch because there may just
be a project coming up soon
