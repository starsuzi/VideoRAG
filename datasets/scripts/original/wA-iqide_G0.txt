What's up guys!?
Danny from Danny Mac's Kitchen
Good to see you as always
Listen, this is totally an unplanned video
I was not prepared to do this
but I felt compelled to do so
because I came across an item in
the supermarket that I have not seen
in a really, really long time
I was at my local "stop and shop" supermarket
here
and in the corner I just happened to see this
item
and I was like, "You know what?
I have to buy this
and do a video because I haven't made this
in a really, really long time
So I came across these guys in my local supermarket
and I was blown away
I haven't seen these in a really, really long
time
I used to see these in the south
when I worked in florida
These are immature fern fronds
and they make a really great vegetable
They're actually very high in omega 3
and omega 6 fatty acids which would
blow you away because you only associate that
with fish, right?
But no these guys are
really, really high in that
So I found them
I wanted to throw together a quick video
Something really simple for you guys
in case you come across it in your supermarket
and let's get started!
So yeah, this is spontaneous
So we're going to throw together something
really, really simple and quick
I have a half of a lemon
that we're going to use
I have the ferns
I have a bit of bacon about 3 to 4 ounces
chopped
1 ounce of garlic
2 tablespoons of fresh sage
and we're just going to season
with a little bit of salt and pepper
and that's all you need guys
So it's really important with any vegetable
like this to blanche it
blanching being the process where you boil
it
for about 45 seconds
Then you strain it and immerse it into
an ice bath where the cooking process stops
So that's what we're going to do
We're going to take these guys
We're just going to throw them in here
We're just going to move them around
for 30 to 45 seconds
You can see the color coming out
beautiful green
Looking great
We don't want to overcook them
that's why we're going to put them
in to the ice bath
It's going to stop the cooking process
and then we can move on
Now that we've strained it
You need to cool it off
Stop the cooking process
Really toss it around
Let those vegetables cool
Go ahead remove the ice cubes
Remove the water and we're going to move on
We're going to sautee a little
bacon, some garlic, some fresh herbs
and we are set
So after heating up some oil, olive oil
For about 30 to 45 seconds
over medium, medium high heat
Add 1 ounce of garlic
Toss that around
We're going to add the bacon
that we chopped up
about 2 to 3 ounces of bacon
You really want this to cook for a little
while
Probably about 3 minutes
Bacon is looking nice and cooked
Smells great, add the blanched vegetables
Some sage, a little bit of fresh lemon juice
and season with salt and pepper
That's all you need to do
Real simple presentation
Awesome!
Give that a good coating
Alright, turn off your flame
That's all you need to do
This is such a great side dish
Let's plate her up
Mmm, spectacular!
Garnish with a little fresh sage
in the corner
and that is beautiful!
Enjoy guys!
