oh my god, that's so sour!
 
thats like really sour holy crap!
hello everyone
and welcome to another
episode of Joey's
creative corner of the room
thing pinterest
whatever
you want to call it,  anyways it's been a while
uh
I haven't posted in a vlog in a while I'm so fricken sorry
I've been on set you know shooting a movie
just kidding not a movie it's my youtube red show
uh
just wrapped on it, it was wonderful it was great
uh
and that will be coming out in.. I dunno sometime later this year
heh I was almost about to say but then I was like wait can I say?
okay
anyways uh today we're going to be making a tie dye t-shirt
made out of Kool-Aid
is that crazy? Kool fricken Aid
uh
I sorta came up with the idea but I didn't because no idea is original anymore
and
uh
there actually are pinterest things but they all aren't crap
so uh I'm going to try and make a tie dye t-shirt
out of Kool-Aid
people have done Kool-Aid hair dye and I was like well
I could do that but I don't want to screw up my hair it already is screwed up
anyways
um
let's get on with the fricken video
all you need is Kool-Aid, water some like containers?
or I guess you could just do cups uh to put the Kool-Aid in
um
and then t-shirt and rubber bands
because that's the key
to making tie dye t-shirts is the rubber bands
to keep the t-shirt together, scrunched in a specific way
uh
to make a design
so uh
we're going to get started with the t-shirt
uhhh and we're gonna
you know
just put it on the table
and
take like a stick or something weird
and then I guess you're just supposed to oh god
I'm just gonna twist it myself
you just grab it here and twist in a circle like this
until it's all scrunched up nice and tight like
okay
Never Mind
Am I doing it?
Its a nice spiral..
Okay.. and then I think you just like
..Uh oh.. UH OH its coming apart
Oh shoot! Okay how do we do this?
This shirt is not going to turn out right, I-I don't know
Also.. I'm not using purple Kool-Aid because I think that is just going to look too muddy and dirty
Alright so now I have it all scrunched up into this thing
I don't know if it is going to turn out okay uh
but it's all gorgeous
now for the fun part
uh
So we're gonna take our Kool-Aid
(Oh god, how do I take this off?)
(I haven't had Kool-Aid for 12 1/2 billion years)
Oh! You can just twist!
Oh! That tastes pretty horrible
It tastes like cherry medicine.
I hate cherry medicine.
How may of you guys had cherry medicine as a kid?
and would ohh.. memories
My mum tried to like force fed me cherry cough syrup and I was just like spit it out
I don't know why they think like cherry is a good cough or like medicine flavor
it's like disgusting
Alright, so I'm just gonna fill this up nice and good like. Alrighty. We got some water we're get make some Kool-Aid
Imma have a sip... not of the cherry
cause we know I don't like it
I don't even know is it going to work?
I feel like
the more...  uh Kool-Aid you use the more uh potent it'll be
just want to shake it up
Alright, moving on
We've got the red
Lets move onto yellow
Only got the packets so this is all I got for the yellow.
Kay
You know what thats what scissors are for
That's why I brought the scissors
Good source of Vitamin C it says.
Ugh this doesn't even smell that good.
Gonna try a little...
OMG that is so, sour!
That's like really sour.
Holy Crap
Not even being dramatic at all
That's super potent holy crap! that's like extreme. Guys
if you ever go to the grocery store get a
packet of this if you liked sour stuff
holy crap I was not expecting that oh ok
so much as the red but whatever it's
gonna be crazy
look at how potent that is like a
real nice yellow
ok same thing with the green which is
lemon line and yes i am going to try
Oh same thing
ya think they all go aw hi so i didn't have
that much green packet but hopefully
this will do uh
Oh making a mess
okay and last but not least is the blue
barracuda
I'm going to try this one
it's not sour it's good mmm
that yummy you know what it tastes like fun dip
that was a lot a lot of blue in there
this isn't blue this is red
oh no I feel very deceived
this is misleading packaging no it's not
there's frickin' red on the front of it dang
it
we didn't get the blue cool-aid are you
kidding me what's the point of having a
red kool-aid
that's a whole cherry and a red one
called blue it's misleading and I was
sueing. Sueing you kool aid it's poor unfortunate
soul but we're gonna have to make do
with what we have what we have is red
yellow and green
ok so what we're going to do is I'm
going to put a little bit of red yellow
green red yellow green
ok let's try it
no it's not sticking to the sharp
get on it there come on scweeze it good like
oh it's a mess
this shirt is rebounding it's like I don't
want this kool-aid
oh no that's not good we got the red
their let's move on to yellow
oh my God how come it just bounces
off is it the kool-aid or is it the t-shirt I
don't know probably the t-shirt probably has like stuff on it
so if you're really thirsty just sweat a
lot and you'll have naturally made kool-aid
maybe are you supposed to wet t-shirts
first maybe
okay breathe loop back on to read I mean
these are not the color i would choose
i'd probably go with other
colors all right last
let's go back to green oh green was so
good
alright so the red and green is mixing together
not in a cute way um I think you're supposed to let this dry but for the sake of the video I'm gonna untangle it and see
whats here ready to reveal
yummy it actually doesn't look bad on camera oh I
should squeeze out all right so i
waited a little bit and it's dry like for a few
seconds and now i'm going to take the
rubber bands off and have a big reveal
still really wet so if I were to do this
again i would definitely get the good
kool aid colors like a variety and also
i would do it in the rainbow color
because the red and green just like blended together and not in a cute way
Wooooooooahhhh It worked! holy crap! holy crap! oh my god! oh my god! look at this
I did it holy crap! I didn't think it would look like a tie-dye t-shirt  but it does from freaking kool-aid
are you insane I'm insane are you?
this is literally everything and more
holy crap like the biggest test would
be to like put it in a washing machine
and see if the color stays
it's really sour it smells good
really
really strong okay so anyways this is
insanity
thumbs up if you are freaking out of the
sight of this because i don't think this is going
to work
