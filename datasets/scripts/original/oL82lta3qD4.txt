Now I'm going to show you how to properly
oil your keys. First I'm going to start off
and tell you what kind of type of oil to use.
I like to use just a regular key oil, which
is available at any music store. They also
have just regular 3 in 1, which is available
at a hardware store. And I like to mix these
in a little bottle here, if you can find one,
usually find one at a beauty supply store.
And mix those pretty much half and half to
get a nice viscosity that I like. We'll start
off of course, we don't need to do any oiling
on that part. But we'll start off, you basically
need just the smallest little drop of amount.
If you over oil your key mechanisms, you have
all these little key corks on here that will
fall off. That loosens the glue underneath
and it'll just, they'll just fall off on you.
But we just want to take this on every little
point and there are several because these
keys are all pinned together on one long rod.
So why not take time, make sure that we get
each one of them. And oil them nicely. Okay,
and after we're done oiling them go ahead
and work it all in good, work each of the
keys and make sure we have no binds or any
of that in this. DNow I'm going to show you

Do it to our foot joint here, and this foot
joint can be a little bit tricky sometimes.
If it gets bent or anything it can cause some
problems. But here's the oil, each little
point here. And I also like to take time to
oil the ruler so that doesn't get stuck or
make any noise on you. But that is how to
