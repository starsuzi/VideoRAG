hey everyone this is Gary the Renegade
dreambuilder here and today we're
testing a dehydrated
fake now what's so important about
this first it won't conduct electricity
we're going to prove that with
conductivity light here in just a second
I even chopped it up and put it in a
different Bowl because I had somebody
say well what if you Cho this stuff
up
now what's really key to remember about
any hydrated fruit or vegetable is that
when you eat
it your body has to
hydrated and if you're not drinking
water while you're eating this it's
taking the liquid from your body making
you even more
dehydrated so that is one of the keys in
order to digest this it has to hydrate
it and if you're not drinking water to
hydrate it is taking water from your
body dehydr in
you so remember that when you
are eating any dried fruits or
vegetables now in a little while we're
going to be uh
testing a hydrated date to see if it
will conduct electricity I think it' be
an interesting test and I look forward
to doing that so let's get at it so
today we're going to be testing a fig
and you can see this is
dehydrated and we're just going to take
this stick it in there and see what it
does see if it
lights I've taken another one and
chopped it up I've had people say well
what if you chopped it up would it work
no it won't work doesn't matter how many
pieces you chop it into if it won't work
as a whole date then it will not work as
a chopped date
I want to show you that this water is
also
dead and what we are going to do is
we're going to take this other
[Music]
date we're going to throw it in the
water and let it soak for a couple of
hours then we're going to test it again
and just so you'll
know see if we can't get enough of this
balled up here that I
can stick the things
into get a buch of them on
there but it won't light it
can't because there is no hydration in
it there's no
water so you can see the difference
between the hydrated and the
dehydrated scan this back a little bit
and just to show you here's the water
charged and this is the
Fig
charged and this is the dehydrated
fig so as you can see the more hydrated
your body is the more conductive it is
the more conductive it is the stronger
it is now let's give this fig water a
taste the color look almost like beer
that is sweet and
delicious actually it's amazing I didn't
think it would be that
good conductive sweet
delicious
hydrational more kaj youas for in
anything so this is Gary the Renegade
dreambuilder saying I hope you found
this helpful and here's to your health
my
friends wow that is
[Music]
delicious
