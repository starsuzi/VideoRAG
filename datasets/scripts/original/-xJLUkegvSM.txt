Hello guys it is Barry here the kids are off
school so I am joined by phoebe and chloe
it is one of the last recipes for cookie month
which you guys have been loving a selection
are on the screen right now what have we just
made, anzac biscuits, anzac biscuits that
is right these are named after the Australian
and new Zealand army corps right Chloe yeah
you knew that didn�t you apparently these
were rations in world war one and were popular
and loads of you wanted to see it so if you
would like to have a go hit pause on the video
when chloe makes the sound of a dog chasing
a pigeon, woof woof.
That was an amazing impression give me five,
alright so the ingredients are also in the
description box down below and full method
on my website Phoebe has had a taste already
what do you think they taste like, they taste
really nice and sweet, so this is how we did
it.
So the first step is an adult one so I sat
some butter into a saucepan over a low flame,
just to melt it up, with the butter melted
I took it off the heat and passed it to phoebe
yeah, I scraped in some golden syrup, yes
we did a tablespoon of golden syrup you can
also use corn syrup if you like.
Then we had a glass of boiling water and phoebe
what did you tip into that glass, bicarbonate
of soda 
alright so that goes in there little mix then
where did you pour that I poured it into the
pan with the butter and syrup mixture get
it in there nice little stir around.
Then it was chloes turn what did you do mate
I put the ingredients into the empty bowl
that is right so we had one big bowl of ingredients
then tipped it in, and I mixed it, you did,
you did tipped it all in there and mixed until
fully combined, then it was a case of adding
the wet into the dry mixture so I did the
pouring bit as it was a bit dangerous then
you guys stirred it through did you have a
go chloe, yeah!
And what was it like it was like disgusting,
I tasted a little bit and it was a little
bit disgusting bit disgusting it was not you
liked it, a little bit disgusting these guys
were loving it, trust me.
Then it is just a case of getting a lined
baking tray then what do you do with that
then Phoebe, get a spoonful of it roll it
up into a ball place it on the tray and you
push it down gently to be flat like a biscuit,
amazing make sure they are well spaced apart
as when you bake them they will spread, put
them in the oven for 9 minutes at the temperature
on the screen right now, transferring them
to a wire rack to cool down, I have not actually
tried one yet but they smell like popcorn
to me, what do they smell like to you, they
smell like gingerbread, gingerbread, yes give
me five.
I think we are going to end up eating all
of these right, no, why not oh yeah chloe
wants to decorate some with some pink icing
so we will be doing that that�s it then
