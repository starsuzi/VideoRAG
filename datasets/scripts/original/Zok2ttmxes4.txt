I'm here again tonight I have dandelion
greens if you look back at my CSA box
one of the things that I had in there
was the dandelion greens so the reason
I'm doing this tonight is because I
think a lot of people don't know how to
prepare it and I looked online and tried
to find the same thing that probably a
lot of other people do how do you
prepare dandelion greens and I like
dandelion greens one of the things that
I'm doing
tonight is I'm chopping them up and
they're in salted water you don't have
to heavily salted but you want to put
enough in here to where it's going to
help extract some of the bitters so I've
got this ready and I will strain that
prior to cooking and the other thing
that I'm doing is I've got a cutting
board ready full of sliced onions I
prefer sliced onions because I like the
caramelized flavor that you can really
get from them and I like the size of
that got garlic and bacon yes over in
the pan pan here I'm going to walk over
to the pan so you guys can see in the
pan I rendered you can actually see
where the two bacon slices were I've
rendered some of the fat the reason I
have done that is because Bacon Fat has
a lot of salt and good flavor to pick it
up but all I need is two slices so all
I'm getting is about a tablespoon of fat
by cooking up 2 tablespoons of bacon
okay so after letting draining my excess
liquid off of my dandelion greens you
will notice that your water is a little
bit Brown and that's because the acids
it's not because your dandelion greens
were super dirty it's actually because
the acids pulled out some of that bitter
flavor in the water so if you
look in here you can see the water is a
little bit discolored
okay so once you have your your fat
rendered off of your bacon you're going
to want to add your onions
first your onions are going to take
about 5 minutes because you really want
to caramelize your onions you don't want
to add too high of a heat I would
say medium to medium low and it may even
take you depending upon your heat about
[Music]
5 to 10 minutes actually so let it cook
down and then we'll come back okay so
you can now see how much the onions have
started to caramelize you'll see the
little bit of the brown coloration
coming out in them this is about the
time you want to add the garlic the
reason you don't add the garlic in too
early is because if you do you're going
to burn the garlic and once your garlic
goes
Brown you you want to get rid of it you
don't actually want to eat your garlic
once it gets Brown so you can see that
I'm going to add the garlic
now and this is a great time to add it
because it's going to really soften it
up impart a lot of flavor but not burn
the garlic that's the key thing you just
don't want to burn your
garlic okay so now we're back and we've
got our garlic sauteed a little bit
maybe about 2 minutes or 3 minutes
just enough to soften it up and and
impart again another really good amount
of flavor into this mix now note I'm not
salting anything yet now I'm going to go
ahead and take my well strained greens
so these are what the dandelion greens
are they're gorgeous they've got a nice
little red Hue to them and they're well
drained we got the bitters out of them
and I'm going to let these saut√© just
like you would spinach
okay so now you can see how much this
has reduced down and reduced means it's
kind of wilted and started to lessen in
the amount in the sense of quantity so
it's the same way that spinach
would now Danny lime greens are a little
bit bitter so in order to cut that
bitterness one you have sweetness well
the onions when you let them caramelize
they become sweet the other way is using
a red wine vinegar so I'm just going to
add a
splash of red wine vinegar enough
to start to cut that
bitterness and also to give it a little
bit of
sauce and basically we are ready to
serve the only thing left because we
rendered the fat from the bacon we need
to add back the
bacon
so we'll add back the bacon and
crumbles and this is a way that you and
your family can enjoy Dand lime greens I
hope you find something edible to chew
on here today have a good day
