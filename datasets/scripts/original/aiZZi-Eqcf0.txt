My name's Jeb
And this winter I grew some hydroponic Broccoli and Kale
(Choir Singing Joyously)
Late October Southern California
I'm going to start my seeds in some one inch rock wool cubes
Rock wool is as far as I can tell
Fiberglass with green food coloring
But it works pretty well
Germination rates have been great for me with this
Here's a little seedling tote that I put together
For starting my seedlings
But you could use just about anything
You could even use a plate
With the rock wool just sitting on it
As long as you kept it moist enough
(Choir Singing Joyously)
Here I'm soaking the rock wool
And you can also see the two inch net cups that I'm going to use to hold it
And here's the water level, it's about a quarter inch up the net cup
And I'll check it maybe every other day
Just to make sure the rock wool stays nice and moist
The seeds are big enough, I can drop then in the rock wools by hand
And I'll poke them just a tiny bit under the surface
And I'm sheltering the seedlings under this Agribon cover
Using PVC on top of a 27 gallon tote
And I like the Agribon it's real durable
And it keeps the pest out
And it protects from frost just a little too
Week 3
The seedlings seem ready to transplant
I'm going to move them into their own 27 gallon tote
The tote is still dirty from the last grow
I'm going to dump out the nutrients on a lemon tree
And I don't get too paranoid about cleaning the tote
I just rinse it off with a hose
(Choir Singing Joyously)
Here I'm filling the tote up with water
You want to make sure you put the tote exactly where you want it
Because once it's full it's going to be much too heavy to move
22 gallons is the perfect amount
And you can see there's a water stain where that should be
All we have to do now is mix up our nutrients and we can transplant
44 grams MasterBlend Tomato 4-18-38
(Choir Singing Joyously)
44 grams Calcium Nitrate 15.0-0-0
(Choir Singing Joyously)
22 grams Epsom Salt
(Choir Singing Joyously)
Unfortunately I transplanted these seedlings too early in their life
Week 5
And they died
So I'll put in the backup seedlings
One of them is a Kale
You can see here these little spots on the leaves
I thought that might be mites
And it turns out it wasn't because the plant was healthy
I think maybe it was just lack of light
This is the middle of winter right now
Week 12
These guys made it through the winter
So let's watch them grow
