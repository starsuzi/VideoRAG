hey everyone it's James from FunFoods and
today I'm going to make this
3-ingredient oreo cookie ice cream cake
now this is a beautiful recipe and I got
it over from the chef fanatic youtube
channel so go over check it out and put
a link in the description below and i
will put all those little cards above he
has some amazing recipes on that channel
and I think you're going to love them
too so for right now keep watching and
I'll show you step-by-step how to make
this now the first thing I'm going to do is start
off with a package of oreo cookies i'm
going to use all but six of these for
the crust part so just remove six of them
the reason i do that because it comes in
a package of 36 so if you have one of
those bigger packages just use 30 i'm
using a food processor for this step but
if you don't have one don't worry all
you need is a large ziploc bag put your
Oreo cookies in there and zip it up you
something heavy to smash them down into
little bits but don't take the easy way
but once these have all been crunched up
into little tiny pieces now we're going
to take this and put it into a medium
bowl
and I have five tablespoons of melted
butter I'm going to pour it in here and
mix it up real good for next step i have
a springform pan these are more of these
pans that pop off on the sides and the
bottom comes out you have any baking
store Walmart Amazon just about anywhere they
sell them. and i'm going to just fill the
bottom of this with my crust my oreo
crust and you can use a spoon and just
kind of press it down firmly try to make
it as even as possible
now i have a large bowl here i put a
half of gallon of regular vanilla ice
cream in it
I let it melt down on its own and so
it's come to about this consistency
where it's easily to start easy to stir
but arm not to melted I don't want to be
like soup i want it still to be thick
and what I've done was when we pulled
aside and we left six of those oreo
cookies out i'm using three of them
right now and do one at time I'm just
gonna crumble up my hands you can put in
a baggie and just crush it if you want
or crumbled up right into this ice cream
and they could be as big or as little as
you want the chunks it up to you it's
whatever your preference is now just
take this and mix it through get all
those chunks mix through completely and
i'm bringing back my crust now all going
to do is take this and pour it into the
container all in there
and then just spread it out evenly when
you have that done we can decorate this
number of different ways you can crumble
up some more and put on the top or you
can cut oreo cookies in half which is a
challenge and kind of go around and
decorate the edges and if you have one
that didn't cut good just crumble that
up real small bits and sprinkle it on
the top now what you want to do is put
this in the freezer for at least four to
six hours when I like to do is put on a
baking sheet so that if any of it leaks
out before it starts to firm up it won't
go all over my freezer just like so now
after about 4 or 5 hours in the freezer this
is nice and firm i'm going to just
separate it from its a springform pan
what I'm going to do before i do that is
just take a butter knife or something
like this and go around the edges
because we want to make sure it doesn't
stick to it just so it has a nice clean
look
and we just pop off the sides pull it
through now it's time for the taste test I'm going
to dig into this i know it's gonna be
delicious but try it out anyway so good
cookies and cream ice cream is awesome
you got to give us a shot it's real
simple to do try it out for yourself
