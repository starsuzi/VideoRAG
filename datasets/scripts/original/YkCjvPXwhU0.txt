So, we always use crystals in our drinking water,
at the Gingerbread Cottage.
You can see some amethyst in there,
some mountains quartz,
and a little bit of calcite quartz.
This one just has mountain quartz in it.
And what that does is basically debatable,
There's all sorts of theories about what crystals can,
health benefits and emotional benefits
they can provide, and there is scientists
who will tell you that water is a very important thing
and how you treat your water is very important.
But, what we mainly do, is use them in place of ice,
They hold the cold a very long time,
and they don't, we don't have to make ice ever.
So, it's a lot easier to use them.
They are also really good for conversation pieces,
everybody wants to know why they're in there,
but that's our main reason.
They keep it cold, it looks pretty,
and gives somebody something to talk about
at our bed and breakfast.
That's crystal water,
maybe has mysterious magical powers,
maybe not, but it does keep the water cold,
without the mess of ice.
