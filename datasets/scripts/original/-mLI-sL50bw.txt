I guess I'm recording
now I'm first I'm going to mix up a
color called Sienna I call Sienna Brown
and then that's going to be the color
that I'll use to mix with a white to
make
flesh and I have to get the proportions
um this is according to quite a few
experiments what I do is I
divide the bars the way the Clay
comes um I divide it up into eight parts
so each one of these balls is 1/8 of a
bar and um the formula that I worked out
has um two blocks or two balls two one
28 of um yellow and then it's got it
calls for 3/4 of
a part of an eighth so I so I cut it so
that I've got
3/4 of the red and then this one I just
need like 16th of
this 1/8 part so I cut it in half and
half
again then we got a
quarter cut that in half again then
that's an eighth and then we cut that
one more time and that is a
16th and this is the proportions to make
the
brown that um for making
flesh so I'm going to mix these together
and
see how it comes out should
work I think I need a little bit more
water cuz it's it's kind of a little bit
on the dry side being it's not it's some
clay that I've had for quite a
while
I'm going to put this on
pause so now I've got my sienna
Brown and now I need to
mix
um like an entire block of white with
one of those small small 16th in units
of this
brown it's about about that
amount
with
eight parts this is one full block of
the
white That's How Strong the the pigment
is
this much
brown with all this
white we'll see how that
goes that's what my notes say
so see what it
does 64 oh you know what I think I need
to put
in I think I need two units of the brown
for a
whole a whole uh
bar or this is going to be a very light
flesh see I
didn't one bar with two units of Sienna
Brown is what it
says so I'm going to put in one
more I didn't read
it
right
okay now we
have our basic
flesh of course you can go lighter or
darker according to how much
