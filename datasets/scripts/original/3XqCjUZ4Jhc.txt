Quite often you may see a recipe
that says core and peel a tomato,
or even a tomato, if you're
reading it in America.
I want to show you how to do that.
Take a knife, and what you want to do
is just at an angle, come on the inside,
just coming around.
You can see I'm using a
sharp knife to come around.
If you've got a star tip from a
pastry bag, you can also use that.
Or there's another thing
called a tomato schock
you can buy in these gourmet stores.
Now that we've got the top off, we're
going to put this in some water.
So we take a slotted spoon so the water
comes through, and then we put that in.
This goes in there, and
then you count to about 15.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12-- are you bored yet?
I'm getting bored with me, as well.
13, 14, 15.
Now at this point, what you want
to do is bring the tomato out.
I've got some ice water.
This is called refreshing.
And basically what that does is
it stops the cooking process.
If you don't put it in there,
it's going to keep cooking
and you'll end up with a soft tomato.
Bring this out, and now you
will see with that knife,
you'll see that the skin
comes off effortlessly.
And that's how you peel the tomato.
So if you're making a posh
sandwich, like a tea sandwich,
this is one of the things you
can do, just peeling it off.
I hope you like this tip.
We've got lots more tips
coming your way soon.
I'm John Ashton.
See you soon.
Cheerio for now.
