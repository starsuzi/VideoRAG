My name is Mike Jones, and I'm a barista at
Third Rail Coffee right by Washington Square
Park in New York City.
I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making
skills.
I'm gonna show you how to make an espresso,
starting with grinding, dosing, and then measuring
and tamping.
The first thing to do is remove the portafilter.
This is the object that you actually place
the coffee in and then put into the espresso
machine.
You want to make sure it's nice and clean.
No water in there, otherwise the grounds will
stick to it and you'll have an uneven extraction.
All right.
So, this is a really nice grinder.
Every other grinder is just sort of variations
on the same theme, which is you have coffee
in the hopper, you grind it in the chute,
and it comes out in the doser.
Many will have the little dosing lever that
you actually have to pull to get the grounds
in there.
This one just comes straight out, but it's
the same concept.
So, the first thing I'm gonna do is push this
button here until it's reached the level of
coffee that I want.
You want to make sure that as you're grinding
it, it's centered in the basket.
If it gets to one side or the other, you want
to distribute by either tapping along the
sides or using your fingers to level off any
excess coffee.
So, that's how you grind a dose into the basket.
