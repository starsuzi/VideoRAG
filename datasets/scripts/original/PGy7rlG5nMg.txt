I have to make the whole so here it is a
Orden on the side of date here all the
wires will came in and after day this is
a holes for the circuit and this year it
is holes for the heat source and down
there I have make this sore holes for
the fan we have done the holes now we
are going to put wires in it one for the
fan area and one for the circuit area
be sure that you put the sticker side
onto the bulb
you
okay now everything is ready and this
incubator is ready to use
now we have to check if it is working
perfectly so again we have all button
and see the light goes on the light is
on the fan is working and blowing the
air to it and see this is the sensor you
have to put the sensor on to the bulb
and see here how much on how much
temperature it will go and it will push
off the sensor it's off on the 38 it
triggers the birth of when it reaches 37
it will turn the valve on again
so this is how it was
[Music]
now I'm putting the it's way
okay so we're inhibitor is ready and you
have to take a look in from inside there
is the heat source and there are water
walls there are the fan in between em
and then there is create and that's the
simplest incubator you can make as you
can see we have reached 38.1 Fahrenheit
and you have to be switched off for 38
let's see how it is okay so it get off
when it reached to the 38 now I'm going
to go down to 37 and it will turn on so
let's see what we do have inside of it
this is the hydrometer and we use it to
measure the temperature and humidity so
it is no dead much useful so here we
have this incubator it is very simple
and very effective individually you can
make in your home in just 10 minutes low
water under a half an hour so let's see
what do we have here we have this tray
and sensor you see this is get on and
there is a heat source
there's the fan and those two balls are
for the water phase so yes these are
very simple and effective individually
you can make at your home
