the sail on the sailboat is like this
beautiful color contrast against the
water so i'm thinking we are definitely

i am going to make a boat for jessa cake
so she can travel the world by sea
with her new shopkins friends of course
using poster board wooden dowels
ribbon
string or yarn a plastic line tote bag i
found this at the dollar store and glue
on a small piece of poster board i start
by sketching the bottom of my boat
cut it out fold it in half to make sure
both sides are even use it as a pattern
on another piece of poster board trace
around it
twice then cut them out to make two cut
four long strips of poster board draw a
line a half of an inch from the edge on
both sides make small cuts up to the
line fold them over
repeat on the other strips of poster
board take the cutout for the bottom of
the boat
glue it onto the tabs making them curve
around the front i left a little extra
in the back so i can bend it around the
edge take the excess and fold it to make
a tab take a second strip of poster
board and glue it on just as before when
i get to the pointed end trim off the
excess
leaving a little on one side to fold
over and make a tab
so i can glue the sides together to
create a point cut leftover pieces of
poster board fold over the sides to make
tabs glue them inside to add strength
use the pattern to make another cut out
glue it on top then repeat to make two
holes cut rectangles of poster board to
fit across before gluing them together i
cut a small rectangle out of one side
after cutting all of the layers stack
and glue them together glue it on top to
connect the holes cut and glue together
two strips of poster board round one
corner and cut a slope on the other glue
it onto the sides
glue paper onto the sides to decorate it
cut and glue ribbon across the opening
in one direction
and then the other weaving it through
frame it with more poster board to make
a net glue a wooden dowel
to the center
cut a long piece of string glue the
center at the top of the wooden dowel
then glue the ends to the sides
cut wooden dowels glue one to the bottom
of the center wooden dowel glue smaller
pieces of wood and dowel around the edge
use string
to connect them to make a handrail for
the doll cut a triangle out of a plastic
covered tote bag
glue it onto the wooden dowels in the
center to make a sail
to make the perfect catamaran boat for
jessa cake and this boat is perfect for
jessa cake in season 8 she has a whole
new international style
dressed from head to toe in red white
and blue and you can see a lot of those
colors in the sail and the design on the
side of the boat was inspired by her
hair on this boat i'm sure jessa cake
will feel right at home
as she sets off for a world vacation
and you're done happy crafting

vacation

first stop is

given the wind conditions
average speed of the boat trade winds
this should take about
two months
