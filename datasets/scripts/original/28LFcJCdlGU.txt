Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo. Today I'm gonna
talk about the aPallo wrist brace. It's great
for things like carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis,
tendonitis in the wrist, any kind of injury,
it's gonna help stabilize the wrist to help
the healing process. This one's nice because
it gives you a day and a night splint. Right
out of the box, it's got some pretty cool
stuff. It has a little sleeve that you can
put on once you get it on to protect it, and
then you can clean this later so you don't
have to clean the whole brace if it gets dirty.
It also come with a little coolie pack which
is nice to give you some relief from then
pain for icing it. And then you have both
braces. You can also buy them individually
if you want to. This is the day brace, and
this is the night brace. It's got some instructions
to go with it on the side. And also on the
inside. So let's start with the day brace.
To put on the day brace, you're gonna open
everything up. This piece right here actually
goes on the opposite side. You put your thumb
in the hole, and put this hard piece on top
of your hand. Then you're first gonna take
the open piece here, and come around and strap
it to the other side. I usually don't do it
very tight until I get everything in place
and then I'll tighten it up afterwards. Then
this top piece comes around. And then you
have this little piece on top where you can
bring it around and put it in the loop to
tighten it up. So again, everything's nice
and lose. Once I get it in place, I'm gonna
tighten it up just a little bit more to make
it more stable. And then this piece can kind
of come down to keep that part from coming
off as well. I like the brace because it makes
sure you don't bend you wrist, so if you've
got that carpal tunnel syndrome, getting that
pressure right there is what's gonna increase
that tingling and numbness in your hand. So
it keeps it in a neutral position while you're
doing things, so it doesn't put that pressure
right there. So it's nice, but you can still
use your fingers and your hands to grab things
if you need to. And then to take it off, you
just go in reverse. And there you have the
day brace. So for the night brace. It's kind
of different, it's pretty neat because it
has a piece that keeps your middle fingers
straight out so when you're sleeping you don't
curl them up and end up putting it under your
chin like that. A lot of times, people do
that, and then they get the numbness and tingling
in their hands cause they're putting all that
pressure on those nerves there. Your thumb
goes in the hole, and then you put the finger
piece on first, and it's the middle fingers
there. And again if you don't want to do it
super tight until you get everything on, you
can do that. And then you wrap this piece
around. So the finger piece goes on the back
of the fingers. And then if you want to tighten
everything up once it's on, to get it nice
and stable, you can. And see how now I can't
bend those fingers, so I can't bend my wrist
either. So if you're sleeping, if keeps it
in that nice neutral position, even if you
want to bring it up this way, you're not gonna
curl that wrist over, and it takes that pressure
off of that carpal tunnel while you're sleeping.
And then to take it off, you just do the reverse.
