hi my name is Aon this is my shop Cakes
by Aaron we're in havil Massachusetts um
you can check us out online cakespy
iron.com and you can check us out on
Facebook as well what I'm going to show
you today are some of the basic
techniques for doing a cake with fondant
um rolling coloring that type of stuff
what you want to start with is basic
white fondant now you can buy it colored
I like to start with white because I can
make it any color I want with the gels
and the paste that I use you can order
online in bigger quantities or you can
actually go to any of the craft stores
the main ones they sell all types um
they sell big bricks of white they sell
smaller bit bits of you know colored
stuff so you can make smaller pieces
today we're working with white and what
you want to
do when you have your faant you have to
make sure that you start with the right
size that you need if you're covering a
cake you want to make sure you have the
right amount the right quantity to cover
it's always good to have more than less
and you're going to
be breaking off some blocks of it it's
pretty sticky it's pretty tough it's a
lot of hand
workk going to need your color we're
using electric pink cuz I like
pink and you need gloves unless you want
your hands to be pain for about a week
so you might want to soften your fondant
up just a little bit because it can be
tough especially if it's been cold it's
really hard to uh
manipulate once you have it a little bit
soft
take whatever coloring you
want just put it on there and you're
going to start blending and folding it
in the good thing about buying white is
you can take some pinks some purples you
can make magenta you're not limited to
the color that you buy you can actually
make any type of color that you need for
your cake so if you want to work with
different tones of greens different
pinks you have the ability with white
fondant
and it takes a little bit it's tough to
use you'll have a definitely have strong
hands and arms by the time you've done a
few
cakes and it's just a lot of blending
and
folding and if it's not pink enough you
can always add more so it's always
better to start with a little less color
and add it as you go cuz the last thing
you want to do is waste your fondant by
blending too much in and then not having
the right color or have it being too
dark
so this isn't bright enough for me I
want to add a little
more the other thing you have to be
careful of with your fondant is that you
don't add too much color if you add too
much it's going to get very sticky very
tacky and then it's going to be actually
too soft to work with um fondant is very
temperature sensitive it's very moisture
sensitive so when you add too much to
it it makes it kind of
unworkable so here we have
little bit of pink it's perfect to use
on any
cake take your gloves
off no color on your hands it's one of
the best parts and then what you need to
do is roll out your
fondant when you roll out
fondant any area like this it's just
going to stick to it it's going to stick
to your hands it's going to stick to
your surface you want use if you have a
marble countertop those work great if
you don't like a silicone mat Sil Pat
mat something like
that and corn starch cornstarch is going
to stop it it'll still stick to this not
as much as a regular
surface take any corn starch that you
can cover your surface area totally
so that it doesn't
stick and nice rolling
[Music]
pin you can spread it out with your
hands a little
bit and then
basically once it gets going if if the
rolling pin's too sticky you can just
put a little bit of corn starch on
that and then it's just a lot
more power with your hands and roll
rolling once you roll your fonding out
to the size in the area that you need to
cover your cake you also have to make
sure that you don't roll it out too thin
if you roll it out too thin it's going
to rip and it's going to tear when you
lay it over your
cake so this should fit just fine and
basically take your pre-rusted cake
you're going to lay it
over and you want to start smoothing
with your
hands the sides of it and the
top slowly bringing your hands in to
bring the sides
in watching out for any tears any bumps
any air
bubbles now that's just with your hands
this to me is a little Lumpy
so you want to use one of these tools
again any craft store anything like that
we call these smoothie guys here CU they
smooth out our
cakes but it's any type of uh faet or
cake smoother and you can use it to
really get the side
[Music]
smooth much more than your hand you got
to watch your hand prints on there
because it is still very soft as you're
using it so you can very easily put any
indents or handprints onto your cake
when working with it just check all
around it to make sure all of your edges
are nice and smooth there's no tears you
haven't missed any
spot now you get to get rid of the extra
fondant that you have take any xacto
blade you can use a knife too I like my
little blades and you're just trimming
right around the bottom edge of your
cake as close as you can get to your
cake good thing about fondant is the
extra can just be balled up put it into
a ziplock bag so that it doesn't dry
out fondant is very air sensitive if
it's dry it's going to dry quicker if
it's humid it's going to be too soft and
sticky to work with so you always got to
make sure that you're paying attention
to that stuff when working with fondant
and then you get a little bit of a lip
down
here just take any smoothing
tool don't worry too much about what it
looks like it doesn't have to be perfect
that's why we trim Out Cakes on the
bottom
just give it once
[Music]
around there you go so you got a good
little cake to start working with and
decorating with
