guys so there is a post going around on
Facebook that says if you um blow up a
balloon using uh baking soda and vinegar
you make a dioxide gas and that you will
not have to use helium um but the
balloon will still float now in the post
it actually says to
use
um 3 tbspoon of vinegar and 1 teaspoon
of baking soda we know that that's not
enough so instead what we're going to do
is we're going to add I don't know a
couple cups
[Music]
so maybe think cup and a half or so so
what we're going to do now is we're
going to take our
balloon and we're going to put some
baking soda in
it I don't
know quite a
bit a couple tpoon let's go ahead and
add a little bit more so we get a good
mixture
I would say that's probably more than a
couple teaspoons
there and let's
uh let's put it on the
lid okay let's see if we can do this
without making a mess
[Music]
[Music]
okay seems to done it but will it float
I take that as a
note but it inflated the balloon and uh
it was fun to do anyways uh thanks for
watching make sure to subscribe to my
channel check us out on Facebook peace
try that again let's use a little bit
more vinegar and a little bit more
baking soda and see if we get a better
uh
[Music]
response all right and let's go ahead
and fill up our
balloon this time we'll use quite a bit
more
oh okay I think we did
it I think that's too much
it's
okay I think it's going to go over what
do you
think all right
here we go all or
[Music]
nothing that was a pretty good reaction
[Applause]
[Music]
well if anything that was pretty
fun for you you won't have to clean it
[Music]
up all
right I doubt this is going to float
okay let's tie it
up that definitely not going to float
once again thanks for watching peace
