Today on Household Hacker,
we're going to save you
as much time as possible.
And that includes
starting with this video.
So let's get right into it.
Some laundry
detergent containers
already have a spout,
which is great for getting
your laundry going faster.
However, if you buy
the regular bottles
and want the same
time-saving feature,
you can try a drink dispenser
for storage and liquid
delivery.
I rummaged through my cupboards
and found an old drink
dispenser that I
haven't used in years.
And it's perfect.
Just pour your cleaning
liquid into the dispenser
and place it on top of
your washing machine.
You'll get super
quick and easy access
that will make your
laundry a breeze.
Not to mention
you'll no longer need
to find a place to store
those huge plastic containers.
If you're tired of a
messy cabinet filled
with plastic bags,
then try this.
Tidy up and save a few minutes
by shoving them directly
into an old tissue box
as you unload them.
Just place one bag in,
leaving the handles out.
Slip the next bag
through the handles
and place them
down into the box.
Lather, rinse, repeat.
This will serve as a
nice compact storage box
and it's a simple dispenser
that will quickly get your bags
to you when you need them.
Constantly dropping nails
or screws when you're
trying to get some work done?
Or maybe you're just pricking
your finger digging them out
of your pocket.
Hot glue a small
but strong magnet
directly to the bottom of
your hammer or screwdriver
for simple access as you work.
This little trick won't
only save you time,
but tons of frustration.
Sometimes, the cracking of an
egg just doesn't go as planned.
But there's no
need to go digging
for that shell
with your fingers.
Just take the most
sturdy half of the shell
and simply use it as a scoop
to retrieve the leftover bits.
This will keep
your fingers clean
and make quick work
of the removal.
Just wash your hands
and cook up those eggs
for a nice delicious meal.
If you're running a bit late
and need to hop in the shower
before you're out
the door, you know
it can take a few
precious minutes to get
that temperature correct.
To save yourself just a little
bit of time in the future,
go fire up your
shower and get it
to that perfect
temperature for you.
Once it's there, just grab a
couple small slivers of tape
and mark your shower handle or
handles at the exact position
that you prefer.
Of course, if multiple
people use the shower,
you can all know what
your preferred temperature
using different colors of tape.
Some earbuds look
exactly the same
on the right and left sides,
which can be a huge pain if you
put them in the wrong ear.
You can easily differentiate
between the two
by putting a tiny dot of
hot glue on just one side.
Now, if you don't have
a hot glue gun handy,
you can also tie off a
small knot on one side
to serve as an indicator.
But this method might
throw off the cord length
just a little bit.
Now, this is my
absolute favorite.
Unloading a soft
drink box doesn't
have to take up all your time.
You can quickly get
everything into the fridge
in just a matter of seconds.
Take your soft drink box
and pop open both sides.
Now, place the box on
a rack in the fridge
and push the cans out
while you pull the box out
at the same time.
And boom, just like that,
you've unloaded the entire thing
in about five, six seconds.
And just let it cool down and
enjoy the fruits of your laboe.
