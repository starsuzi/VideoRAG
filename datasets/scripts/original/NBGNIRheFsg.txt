Welcome to nishamadhulika.com
We need pastry sheets to prepare puffed roll and puffed biscuits.
Puffed pastry sheets are easily available in market but it is not available somewhere.
These sheets can also be prepared at home.
Today, we will prepare puffed pastry sheets.
Let us see what are ingredients we require to prepare puffed pastry sheets.
Maida - 5 cups or 600 grams
Salt - 1 tsp
Lemon - 1
Keep 100 grams maida aside since we will need it later on.
Butter - 500 grams
Let us knead the Maida first to prepare the pastry sheets.
Mix 50 grams butter in maida after mashing it a little bit.
Also, add salt in it.
Adding lemon juice increases gluten in it.
Mix all the things nicely.
Knead the flour now.
We will add water at regular intervals to knead the flour.
The dough should be soft like the dough of Paranthas.
It should be made soft by pressing it again and again by hands for 6 to 7 minutes.
The dough is now ready.
It should come up when pressed when pressed with the finger.
Leave it aside for 10 to 15 minutes.
15 minutes have passed and we will now roll it with the rolling pin.
Spread dry maida on the rolling-board.
We will roll the dough as much as we can in rectangular shape.
Now, we will put butter over it.
Press butter to make it soft.
Give rectangular shape to butter and spread it in middle of the sheet.
Roll the sheet from all the four edges to cover the butter.
The butter is now wrapped in rectangular sheet.
We will roll the sheet again in rectangular shape with soft hands.
Press it first to spread it with your hands.
Spread dry flour on it and roll it with rolling pin.
The sheet is now ready.
Make two folds again in the sheets.
Now, we will keep the sheet in refrigerator for 20 minutes to freeze the layer of butter in it.
We will take this sheet out and the butter inside it will be frozen now.
Roll it again.
Spread dry Maida on it again.
Roll it by applying light pressure on it.
Fold it once again.
Keep the sheet in fridge after it for 20 minutes and repeat this process again.
Repeat this process for 4 times.
Roll it for the last time now to cut it.
We have to roll the sheet into a thin layer.
Therefore, we will divide into three halves.
Apply dry flour over one part and roll it into a thin layer.
Keep the thin sheet on a paper after rolling it out.
Also, keep the second sheet on the paper.
Puffed pastry sheets are now ready.
Preparing puffed pastry sheets is very easy.
But, we have to take little precautions while preparing these.
Knead soft dough by pressing it with hands.
Apply less pressure by rolling it on rolling-pin.
Pastry sheets will burst by applying excessive pressure on it and butter will come out of it.
But if butter comes out of it, then apply dry Maida on it and roll it again.
We have cut puff pastries in A4 size.
But, you can cut it in any shape.
Place these sheets in between butter paper and keep it in freezer.
You can keep these sheets for a while outside refrigerator and
when it comes at room temperature you can use these sheets.
Prepare puffed pastry sheets and share your experiences with us.
