hello ladies and gentlemen this is your
chef from grus cooking.in with KFC style
fried chicken please make a note of the
ingredients for making KFC like fried
chicken we'll take one whole chicken cut
into big eight pieces and the most
important thing is you will take this
chicken with
skin to begin the marination process
I've taken a bowl to which we'll be
adding 2 tbspoon of clean Drinking
Water 2 tbspoon of
CD we add a few spices and condiments
Now 1 teaspoon of
salt 1/4 teaspoon of baking
powder 1 teaspoon of red chili
powder 1 teaspoon of
sugar 1 teaspoon of MSG or
aoto half a teaspoon of onion powder
so here goes in the half teaspoon of
onion
powder and this is garlic powder we'll
be adding half a teaspoon of this as
well here goes the half a teaspoon of
garlic
powder we'll squeeze in half lemon
juice and give this entire mixture a
good mix using a
whisk
make sure you take your time and mix it
up pretty well all the ingredients
should melt into each
other we'll now add half a tspoon of
vegetable cooking oil and give it a
final
mix in this mixture now we'll be soaking
in our chicken pieces I'm using chicken
with skin that's very important and the
pieces I'm using are drumsticks and
wings with
breast so make sure you soak in all the
pieces nicely and coat them well with
these

juices
in order to marinate these chicken
pieces properly we'll cover it with a
lid and refrigerate this in a fridge for
at least 1
hour so here goes in the fridge the
chicken we'll prepare our egg wash now
I'll drop in two
[Music]
eggs followed by 1 tbsp of
milk half a tbspoon of red chili sauce
you can use any brand I'm using chinx
red chili
[Music]
sauce a/4 teaspoon of salt for
seasoning we now beat the hell out of
these
[Music]
eggs we will now keep this egg wash
aside and prepare our dry mixture I've
taken one cup of allpurpose flour or MAA
1/4 taspo of
salt half a teaspoon of garlic powder
half a teaspoon of onion
powder and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder
now give it a good mix using a
[Music]
whisk once you mix up everything will be
spreading now this dry mixture here to
coat our chicken pieces with
them spread it all
nicely we'll also get our egg wash
now and keep it
aside in the fridge it's been 1 hour
since the chicken has been marinated it
looks like this after an
hour it's time for us to now take this
big bars out and coat them well so we'll
first put them in the dry
mixture and coat them nicely by dusting
them and then they'll be dropped in the
egg wash from both the sides coat
them and drop them once again on the dry
mixture and coat them
well so we are coating them twice this
adds for a nice texture and crunchiness
on your KFC style fried chicken we'll do
this for the rest of the pieces so first
in the
MAA then in the egg
wash and finally in the MAA once
again do this for all the pieces and it
is time for them us to deep fry these
bad boys nicely into hot hot oil this is
vegetable oil my friends cooking at a
medium Flame make sure the oil is not
very hot otherwise your chicken will
cook very soon from the outside but from
the inside it will remain
raw so maintaining a medium flame cook
these chicken pieces for around 7 to 8
minutes so that they cook very nicely
from the inside that's very important
we'll cook these chicken pieces Twice
first at a medium flame and we'll
retrieve them after 7 minutes or until
they turn golden brown
and we'll let them sit and relax for at
least 2 3 minutes outside in the
air and get them in contact with the
oxygen so here it's been 7 minutes I'll
retrieve all my chicken pieces by
cooking them like this they are well
cooked from the inside but from the
outside as you can see it's still not
very
crunchy so once you retrieve them we'll
now increase the flame of our gas to
very high
and let the oil become very very hot and
then we'll drop these pieces which have
been cooked for 7 minutes back into this
oil for only just 1 minute now within 1
minute you will see from the outside
they will gain a great golden texture
and they'll become very Crunchy just
like KFC style fried
chicken so see that did not take us much
time 30 seconds on one side 30 seconds
at the other and in 1 minute it'll
become red hot spicy KFC style fried
chicken like this ladies and gentlemen

pieces we'll serve them with some sauce
