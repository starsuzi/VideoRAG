hello I'm Chris Reed I'm going to show
you how we repair aqum holes or slits in
the factory uh and you can do this at
home so it's all using domestic things
like domestic irons and um greas prooof
paper that you should have in in your
house I'm going to use the flesh colored
aqum for demonstration purposes rather
than have black blue or yellow aqum
because it shows up better with the tape
higher contrast so if by some
unfortunate chance you manage to damage
your aqum fabric I'm going to show you
how to repair it um first of all going
to make some holes in the
factory using a uh industrial hole maker
and we'll put a slit in because
sometimes you find particularly with
sports like canoe Polo you find the
scissor action can slice through the
fabric that's a scissor ation of the
boat running over a cockpit so here's a
simulation there
there's a
slit and a
hole we always do the repair using our
repair tapes which is a Hot Melt
adhesive tape with the glue side which
is shiny and the knitted side or the
texture textile side which doesn't have
the adhesive on um we're going to do the
repair on the reverse side of the fabric
which is the knitted side that's because
the glue on the tape can sink into the
textile
so first of all got a spongy mat we're
using a piece of nprint here you could
use a tea towel lay the
repair out in front of you and we're
going to cut a piece of R repair tape
just a little bit longer than the slit
itself and I'm also going to round the
ends off round the corners off just so
that they stay nice and flat when the
repair is
done okay
we use a domestic iron and the heat is
set just about at the um steam setting
so it's not too hot not too cold um
it'll still burn your skin if you touch
your mind so repair repair tape on top
of the textile grease proof paper on top
of that and then for about 15 seconds
we're going to just gently apply a bit
of
pressure with domestic iron and we
should start to see the glue squishing
out from the side a little bit of the
tape as the glue melts and starts to
move out the side you know that the
adion is starting to
happen yeah so we've got the glue coming
out don't try and stretch it straight
away I usually just give a bit of
pressure not so much that it burns but
just a little bit of
pressure until it cools
down and you can see there we've got a
fairly good repair over the slit maybe a
little bit more work to do on the other
side but I'll show you that later
exactly the same thing applies for the
Dots here got a small hole but this time
we've cut out just a small
dot place over the
top greas proof paper and then we use a
tip of the iron just to gently melt the
adhesive and create a repair
maybe try 5 seconds or so take the paper
off just to see if it's if the glue's
squishing out the side maybe another 5
seconds and
then the repair is
done cooling the glue
down keeping the pressure
on to little
repairs okay so here we go this is a
slightly more adventurous repair um and
by that it needs a little bit more
technical ability and a bit more
preparation what we're going to do is
repair the outside this is the
polyurethane side just to try and make
the uh seal bomb prooof in order to get
this side um to a deer with the Hot Melt
tape we have to make sure we really
prepare and clean this surface we use at
the factory here industrial isopropyl
alcohol it's like a rubbing alcohol but
you have to make sure that any kind of
oils or contaminants are taken off the
fabric so it's all in the
preparation we really cleaning
thoroughly giving it a nice rub just to
make sure the surface is fully
cleaned sometimes you can just use water
you have to really this is fresh tap
water
really let the stuff dry and then you
can just um use the grease proof paper
and the iron set at the domestic
temperature just to pre-warm the fabric
this kind of um cleans the whole surface
up a little bit as well maybe do this a
couple of
times and it cleans the surface up now
that's dry and
clean exactly the same um thing applies
now we're going to put the rounded off
corner
of the Hot Melt tape over the slit on
the outside and this time be a little
bit more careful I'm using the tip of
the iron rather than the whole surface
and I'm just gently rubbing over the
surface of the Hot Melt tape just to try
and prevent scorching the
fabric um this being a thermos setting
plastic this material if you put too
much heat on you will Scorch the fabric
it'll turn shiny it probably won't
affect the performance of the fabric but
but just in terms of looks it might look
a little bit more um well a different
surface appearance so 5 Seconds Oro of
heat
applied you can just see the glue
squishing out from around the outside of
the tape here bit more pressure whilst
the glue's cooling down and fixing
itself to the fabric and there you've
got a repair inside and
out
