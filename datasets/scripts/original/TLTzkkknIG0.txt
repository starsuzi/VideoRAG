hello everyone please welcome and join
easy steps today I'm going to share with
you another DIY project whenever things
happen I try to do it and while I'm
doing it I always think about my viewers
my subscribers out there and I want to
share with them in easy steps what
things I'm going to share with you are
you having a problem with the glass
doors they are really dirty
see they all buil up up there I'm going
to share with you you don't need any
chemicals you just need a water to clean
it but
before you clean it I'm going to share a
secret with you a razor
blade as you see it's already started
scraping the same thing on other I was
done almost 70% now it's only 30% left
and I thought about about you I'm going
to share so if you see this is all build
up regardless what chemical you use you
use 409 vexx any chemical household
chemicals doesn't matter what it say you
use this
cleaner any cleaner it's not going to
work matter of fact it takes its time
and course but still it's not going to
work so I'm going to share with you the
easiest way to clean your
calcium build up from your glass door
and how to make it
clean get the blade just scrape it like
this as you scrape it you see all the
buildup is coming
out we need
to you have to you need to tilt the
blade at the 30Â° like this and just keep
doing
it
once it's all clean then you just need a
damp
clothes or paper towel that time you can
use any cleaner or if you want to to
bring the shine otherwise this is the
way to do it so I'm going to keep
finishing up my project as a DIY project
look at this how it started coming out
clean before it was so
dirty
it doesn't take that long with the
blade but as we I'm doing it I'm just
going to share I'm going to extend this
one look how it's ugly it's
looking so if my cameraman can zoom in
you can see the real
picture this it's really fast you can
clean
it and now we can
uh make sure that uh just uh another
tip once you're cleaning it just wear a
mask when you're doing this thing
because uh these chemical can Airborne
easily so if I use a chemical it's not
going to work so if you have that
problem that's how it's easy to fix it
