so we got to take this wild cherry down
we got a bunch of dead branches up there
so I want to find a use for it so I'm
thinking let's make a WOD have a shore
house I'm thinking these areas will work
great big thickness break size let's
chop it down and let's go
okay so we get the right size blog here
first cut we want to make is a flat cut
that's going to be the bottom we wanted
to take the bottom piece and the top
piece off now when we cut the top we
want an angle so that when the snow and
the rain comes it can run right up so we
want to angle it so let's make that
okay now that we had them cut in half
and you will see the angle so we could
set the roof on and a little drain but
as we cut them in half you will see I'm
going to show you two different ways to
hollow these out one is by your table
saw using the blade another is using the
chainsaw the chainsaw is a little
rougher but that's okay the first like
it that way this way they can grab onto
things and climb up you don't need to
smooth smooth finish the birds don't
care
[Music]
[Music]
besides where we want them now
I'm gonna screw these back together I'm
gonna make holes in here we're gonna
pre-drill I'm going to use some
stainless steel screws so they won't
rust and hit the corners first and then
I'll work in the center
good I'm off a little bit in the side so
I'm just going to use the clamps to help
me bring it together the best we can
doesn't have to be perfect okay
everyone got the bottom piece we're
gonna put the bottom piece on find how
that matches because that was a nice cut
it matches and I'm gonna use screws the
reason I'm gonna use screws is if I ever
want to clean this out I'm just gonna
hit four screws unscrew it and it's
gonna be an easy clean out so I'm just
gonna put force just gonna drill tap
them there you go
bottom is done okay
put the top on roll the whole we're
gonna be ready to mount this baby same
procedure with the top we're gonna put a
couple screws and be done not bad
I've got a great slant let's put our
whole we'll be able to mount it and
we're all set all right
got my wood bit I do recommend and do
this on a drill press if you have one I
just don't have to have it don't have it
happen to have it set up I'm gonna try
it the old-fashioned way
[Music]
all right we're all done and I'm pretty
pleased with this what a great little
project hey next time you got to take a
tree down think about it
great project fun and easy to do hope
you learned something here hook had fun
thanks for watching I'm Ken dye Nagar
just another backyard project
