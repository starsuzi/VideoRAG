okay today I'm going to be trying for
the first time Hill Country Fair
buttermilk complete pancake and waffle
mix Just Add Water I chose this one
because it was the cheapest and as a
college student you know I'm on a
budget as for just general
appearance um I mean it's pretty basic
um they didn't really go above and
beyond for anything like I would never
remember oh yeah Hill Country Fair like
I can't even I have to read it I can't
even remember it right now and it's in
front of me so I think they could work
on that in making their box more
memorable uh the Box itself is very
sturdy they definitely didn't scrimp on
the packaging and so I have to give I
have to give the packaging um for its
functionality a solid a solid 9 out of
10 and now the true test it's time to
cook these little
 I got my
mix it's time to
roll oh yeah
when you're making something that's just
Add Water you really need to whisk it
really hard be afraid to get a little
aggressive check out my zit it's hot
right I know I ain't
ashamed h
no first
bite it's a little chewier than I
expected
[Music]
mhm a solid pancake though nothing to go
crazy about but solid
I just love pancakes I'm
sorry if you're on budget you got time
constraints and you just want some
beautiful beautiful carbs H Country Fair
the way to
go final rating for Hill Country Fairs
buttermilk pancake and waffle just add
water
mix for the Just Add Water mixes I would
give their pancakes
a overall a seven out of
10 for pancake mixes overall I would
give them a five out of 10 because
obviously the ones where you add more
stuff are going to taste better what if
we had like pancakes instead of arm hair
my God she hasn't even started shaving
her arm cakes
yet hey man I could grow my own
breakfast like get out of my pit thanks
for watching my first vid there will be
more high quality food ratings to
come I don't know what to say ma'am
pretty
good it is damn good
