hi guys laura vitale on this episode of
lauren in the kitchen i'm going to show
you how to make garlic knots they have
been so highly requested and they are so
simple and easy to make so i'm really
excited to show you this recipe uh
before we get started let's go over the
ingredients
you're gonna need some pizza dough
either whole wheat or white flour does
not matter some fresh parsley fresh
garlic olive oil salt and pepper those
are your ingredients and optional you
can put parmesan in general and toss
them in but i don't do that we did not
do it that way at the restaurant so i
don't do it that way at home so the
first thing you want to do is get your
oven to 400 second thing you want to do
is take a sheet pan and i just put some
parchment paper on there so it doesn't
stick and then on my work surface i put
some flour
now for the pizza dough you can either
make your own and you can check out
laura in the kitchen for a recipe on how
to make pizza
or you can buy it at your supermarket or
your favorite pizza shop we'll love to
sell you a bottle of dough or two so
don't worry just go ahead and ask him
but you can make your own if you want so
all i did is put my bowl of pizza dough
on my counter and i just flatten it out
so it's nice and flat so now what i'm
going to do is cut strips of it just
like that and it's about i guess a half
an inch thick
and next we're just going to roll them
now i used to do this at the restaurant
and we did it really really fast but
you're making a knot so you just take
the two two of your fingers
at one end you wrap it around
wrap it and then you snip and twist
and you make a knot see but if you don't
want to do that you can just do this
and make little tiny ones and you don't
have to cook you know you can just toss
them like that but since these are
garlic knots
i'm just gonna make them
and put them on my sheet pan whoops
those are bit sticky but that's okay
if you feel like it needs more flour
just roll it in some flour shake off the
excess
last one now these are going to go into
my preheated oven at 400 for any
for about 10 15 minutes or so you just
got to keep an eye on them you're just
looking for them to be a golden brown
color and i'll show you the next step
now why am my knots are still baking
because they're not going like nazia we
have to toss them in the garlic oil so
that's what we're gonna make next i have
a teeny tiny little food processor but
if you don't have one of these you can
use a blender or if you don't even have
a blender you can just use a knife and
just chop everything super super fine
but what i'm gonna do is put in some
fresh parsley and garlic in here
and some extra virgin olive oil enough
to make sort of like a like not a
thin thin garlic oil you want to be a
little bit more on the thick side so
you're going to need about a quarter cup
of olive oil total
so a lot i'm going to do now is just
whiz this up
that
looks perfect so all i'm going to do now
is go get my nuts out of the oven
because they should be ready and then
we're just going to finish them up
these little babies baked at 400 for
about 15 minutes they're lightly golden
the top they're loving golden at the
bottom these are good to go now super
important this step has to be done the
minute they come out of the oven
otherwise it's not even worth it don't
even bother with this recipe if you're
not going to do it just put these in a
bowl while they're really really hot
and trust me they're hot but i have
fingers like no one's business and they
can handle the heat
when i'm gonna eat this trust me
if it pays off in food i can handle
anything any kind of pain
so
now we need to pour this garlic oil all
over the top and you might not need all
of it
so just
pour
about half of it
and then i'm gonna just use two wooden
spoons
to toss this together and if i feel like
i need more then guess what i'll put
more on top
but just toss them all together until
they're well coated in the garlic oil
don't forget to season with some salt
and pepper
not too much salt
and continue stirring until they're all
mixed
that looks great
all i'm going to do is just put these in
a bowl and like i said some places toss
them
with some pomegranate jam over the top
too like parmesan cheese i don't do that
because at the restaurant we didn't do
that because we did in the beginning and
then we had a lot of people saying oh no
i can't eat cheese and i can't have the
garlic not so i figured you know what
let's just make them without cheese and
if people want the cheese and get it on
the side so same goes for you if you
want cheese in this recipe toss them in
a little parmesan cheese if you don't
want to just leave it as is i have got
to just eat one
who am i kidding as soon as that
camera's off i'm gonna eat the whole
bowl
the things i do for food
i'm gonna go back for more
i hope you've enjoyed spending time with
me go ahead and get in your kitchen make
garlic knots they're so easy they're so
simple they go great with just about
anything

just go in your kitchen and make them go
