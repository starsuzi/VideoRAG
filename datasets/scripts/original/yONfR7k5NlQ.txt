his home he is going in he grabs some
dirt and backs out and dumps it in the
pile just like that
he'll finish digging that hole then
he'll go get in the skater it's much
larger than you know sting it well put
eggs in there and then he'll get it a
cicada and sting it bring it back put it
down the hole and kind of covers it up a
little bit and when that the baby
hatches and larva comes out and eats
that cicada it's like a one-year process
love these guys they look kind of
threatening but they don't bother you at
all
