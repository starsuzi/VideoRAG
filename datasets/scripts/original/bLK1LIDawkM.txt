okay so to take off a patch you want to
get in
close
yeah
pull just enough
that you can get a sharp blade
just to the fibers
and run it gently until you can
start to pull
let me see you don't want to cut into
your ghee
so just
kind of hold the blade up
trying to focus the camp right here
there we go
so just keep doing that once you get the
first little bit open it gets easier
hmm
so just keep going around
and then really once you've gotten the
patch off
you can just grab a
pair of tweezers I
found that's the easiest to get the
right amazing
fibers out and just
go along and
pick the home and then
that's that's the way that I've found
best to
get the patch off
you know oh
the one thing you really don't want to
do is just
pull the patch right off because you'll
start to tear the key itself
anyway is games there you go I'm gonna
take off the patch
