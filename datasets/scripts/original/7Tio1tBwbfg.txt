Hi, I'm Jason from expertvillage.com and now
that we've done all the cutting and the edges
and the shaping we're ready for the first
part of polishing and sanding. We're using
the 220. Like I said, we're going to go around
the whole thing in a circular motion and we'll
let it dry and mark it. Use the low speed
on your Dremel. And if you're Dremel does
that, this one does all the time. We're going
to rinse it off and then let it dry and I'll
talk about edges a scratches.
