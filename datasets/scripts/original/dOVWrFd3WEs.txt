i think i'm about to cook something
yep i'm about to go over there in that
room
and that that place they call the
kitchen and i'ma cook up something
and i might just take y'all with me if
you behaved what should i make
a cake some brownies
some chicken i think i'll make some hot
water cornbread y'all want to know how
to make chocolate cornbread
the things you will need for some hot
water cornbread will be
sugar yellow cornmeal
i use natural sea salt
some flour and vegetable oil
all right here's a little disclaimer
i don't measure anything when i cook
i just put stuff in the bowl and just
while i just comes out terrific
so you're gonna have to trust yourself
and know the amount of what you would
like
okay
you're with me
first thing boil you some water it don't
matter how much you do just as long as
you do more than a cup
or two you're not gonna use that much
water but you do need
some some very hot water
to mix all of this stuff together so put
your water on first
so i just put about two cups of cornmeal
in my bowl now for the salt
just gonna pour a little bit in the palm
of my hand
that's about like whatever i don't know
a teaspoon half a teaspoon i don't know
i don't use no measuring cups or nothing
bam
throw it in there for the
sugar this
depends on if you want sweet cornbread
or i don't know i'm just gonna pour it
so y'all just watch i'm gonna let you
see
and i will add more that's about
um i don't know but i'm pouring some
more
oops i might have poured too much who
cares
all right flour it does not take
much y'all gonna be so mad at me because
y'all not gonna know the measurements
but you gotta trash yourself
sugar
i don't even know oh well
you know what your mix is pretty much
done now you're just waiting on your hot
water
so i have my hot water and i am going to
pour you don't want it soupy you just
want enough
where it will mix
and make a nice
see that's why i can handle cooking i
can't even talk and cook at the same
time
i'm going to show y'all what it's
supposed to look like
after you mix everything together your
consistency should look like this
where you are able to mold it it
shouldn't
be soupy and i'm going to show you
how to shape it i think my grease too
hot it's going to pop me i'm skirt
this is how my mama used to do it
but her water used to be hotter i don't
know what what her hands was made out of
but i used to be like
mama that's that's hot your hands are
smoking
and she used to just put it in her hands
like this
and she used to shape it
and then it should go in your grease
your oil i hope this doesn't pop me i'm
scared
i'm too close
here they are frying i have turned them
over
one that one broke because um
my battery was getting low and i was
trying to go plug it up
but this should be
like a golden yellow color
all right so they're done see
see the color
you're a nice golden yellow
now for the taste test
told y'all i don't need to measure
nothing
for what i get there for my mama
