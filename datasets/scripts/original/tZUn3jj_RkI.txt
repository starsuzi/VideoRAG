Hi.
This is Stephanie Manley, with CopyKat.com.
Today, it's time to whip
out those old fondue pots because we're making
Melting Pot Cheddar Cheese
Fondue.
Let's get started.
We're going to begin making our fondue.
We are going to start by adding our
two types of cheeses in one bowl, and then
I'm going to add a little bit of
flour to this; this is going to help thicken
up the fondue.
You can just do
this with your hands.
Turn up my fondue pot to a medium-high heat.
In our fondue pot we're going to take about
4 ounces of beer.
Melting Pot
actually uses Coors Light, so be sure to grab
some Coors Light for this.
To
this, I am going to add a couple of tablespoons
of garlic, because most
everything's better with garlic.
Some Worcestershire sauce.
I'm going to
add dry mustard to this.
We're adding this so we can get all the flavor
of
mustard without all of the liquid.
We're going to go ahead and give this a stir.
It's starting to heat up, and
the garlic is starting to cook.
I just want to let the garlic cook for a
moment or two before I actually add the cheese.
This is cooking up just
fine, and now I am adding cheese.
We're just going to stir and let that all
get nice and melt-y.
It takes about 2 whole minutes to make fabulous
fondue
here.
It's time to try this fondue.
That is really good.
I think it's time
to put down the camera and enjoy fondue.
We've just made Melting Pot's Cheddar Cheese
fondue.
You can transform
yourself back to the '60s by enjoying this
tasty treat.
