this video is to demonstrate how to take
a foresight skinfold measurement
introducing our model
Maddy site one biceps the anterior
surface of the biceps midway between the
anterior auxiliary fold and the
anticubital
fucer site two triceps a vertical fold
on the posterior midline of the upper
arm over the tri biceps muscle halfway
between the acran process the Bony
process on top of the shoulder and the
ocum process which is the Bony process
on the elbow site three the
subscapular the fold is taken on the
diagonal line coming from the vertebral
border to between 1 and 2 cm from the
inferior angle of the
scapula a diagonal fold about 1 to 2 cm
below the point of the shoulder blade
and 1 to 2 cm toward toward the
arm site four the Supra
iliac a diagonal fold above the Crest
ofum at the spot where an imaginary line
would come down from the anterior
auxiliary line just above the hipbone
and 2 to three CM
forward add together the four site
readings refer to the relevant gender
table read down to the total figure
obtained and across to the age of the
patient this will give you a reading of
the body fat percentage thank you Paul
