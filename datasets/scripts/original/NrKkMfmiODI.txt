in this video I'm going to show you how
to use your seed
pen first thing you have to do is fill
it with
water to do that slip off the clear top
and unscrew the nib now the nib has a
left-handed thread on it which is a
little
unusual fill it with water this one's
already fil
full and screw the nib back
on wait several minutes until the nib is
moist this one's moist
already and then you're going to want to
touch the
seed the seed pen will pick up the seed
and then you're going to transfer it to
a
moist soil
which I'm using a wet Piper tow
for again just touch the
seed picks it up and it deposits it to
the paper towel
