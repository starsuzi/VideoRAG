hi I'm Mike Atticus videos about
an adenosine Alice in 44 Pennsylvania
and this fireplace is built in 1790
courses been redone but uh fireplaces
are basically the same all you got a
stone going up the sides and it goes up
to chimney which leaves a smoked out of
the house the fireplace I'm going to
show you how I built it it's a real
fireplace exactly the same way you would
go into a house except for a couple
minor things and it put a damper in it
but I'm going to show you how I did that
anyway and let us know
the fireplace or window opening it's my
style of doing things every mason has a
different way of doing things here's how
they started now here's our footer right
here's our footer you can see the rebar
in there
and it's sitting on about 12 inches of
gravel and a lot of people say well how
come you're just not digging a deep
footer because if you ever looked at
railroad tracks
there's no footers under railroad tracks
it's nothing but gravel second thing is
this thing is going to be movable we
could always pick it up with the block
truck and move it so we're going to fill
this with concrete now and then tomorrow
we're going to start building our
superstructure okay this next day
warms up receding rods to go
some parts of the country have that
rival in a whole fireplace because
earthquakes say so
build our fire box first last thing will
be our
time I do a fireplace I make it better
my firefox is gonna look like on the
inside and what I did was I traced it
all while I know where to start my
masonary
all right we have two different types
firebrick we're going to use these on
the bottom I'm going to use a two inch
to go up on the sides and
lay em down in the bed
in first
that's my center mark
leave my thing in Portland
just product they use for my fireclay
throw the centers in underneath is all
Portland Portland water
look like fighters Leia nearly
no matter bottom in now we're starting
our sides I'm going my Saturn
everything's working so that's going to
start right here and ladies our pain our
fire clay
to break
in the fire latest stuff is almost like
a taste got a foot and I may say 16:20
 it's the wallpaper stone
now this our Firebird gutsiness this is
cardboard
on a fireplace like this I want to lay
it out let the honor look at it and say
yeah that's all high I want it or
whatever
then I forgot my arches right here and
Pokemon so I can taste
I'm eight pencil marks right here where
my heart starts so I know where mm
started
right here here's where I'm going to
place my angle
put a damper in or somethin she be 8
inches from here to here that's what the
cold book says that's the way I
interpret it
liar
with no cement and explained life here's
what I'm doing I put my angle iron on I
laid it right on top of my fire brick
with no cement and I came up here and
I'm building this because this is going
to go up to my flow so I'm going to tip
my brick so it goes up underneath the
float right here on the angle iron
I put insulation the reason I put
insulation and this is real important is
this angle irons going to expand and
contract as it gets hot in the old days
they put a big piece of stone but a fire
will eventually crack the stone so this
is my way and what I'm going to do is
put Portland cement in here and lay my
brick on Portland and I got
my little
ride which I'm building my own lentil so
show you how I do that I'm putting my
foot like cement down and I'm sticking
my
right in here
I'm laying my brick cedar brick on one
sides fire clay the other sites Portland
and
laying it in like that
working our way underneath the flu your
ever laying firebrick I keep the brick
real dry
I'm
wanna cover his whole thing's like
with the bricks to make sure it is thick
Oh
okay what we did was we took our forms
out just about an hour ago
we just patch it up in here
we are going to build it up here while
we can put our flu up now the fireplace
for your building there was an outside
fireplace and you don't need a damper
but if you're going to build an inside
fireplace you will use a damper so what
is a damper the only thing a damper is
is a door you open the door and the
smoke comes up and it goes up your flue
when you're not using your fireplace you
close your door and it keeps the cold
air from coming down or the hot air from
going up you build a smoke shelf behind
it this is a traditional way of doing it
and you go from here and from here into
your flue now these things expand and
contract just like I was telling you and
the manufacturer recommends a half inch
on each side so what I do is I cover
with a insulation and then I fill it
solid with cement where it's not going
to move there's a lot to know about them
but it just gives you a little insight
you have to know your flue sizes you
have to know your fireplace opening
there's a lot to know about it but if
you're a beginning mason I would
actually build it dry and that would
tell me where if I was going to make any
mistakes before he made them and I still
do that today
build it dry make your patterns put it
together and that's a damper that's what
the inside looks just in case you could
see that this is Joey's hometown 501

happy hour
