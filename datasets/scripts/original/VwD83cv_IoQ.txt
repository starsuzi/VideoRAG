uh sewing straight you wouldn't think
it' be quite so difficult would you but
a lot of people do have uh trouble with
this
skill uh so I was just going to give you
a little rundown on on my tips for
soaring straight uh first thing is you
got to make sure that you the piece you
sawar in has got a good face side and
face Edge the data references which you
should have planed on so that we know
this is these faces are straight and
square to each other and we do all our
marking from there right so we start off
by marking up where we're going to do
our cut and we use a a marking knife
this is a Japanese uh marking knife and
you can see we've got a flat face and a
beveled face and we always have the flat
face against the square we're putting
the square on against the uh face Edge
we always marking from the face edge
face side place the knife onto the
square
and take a cut like that now we could
knife all the way around but I'm going
to choose to just go rest of the way
around with a pencil a good sharp H
pencil and I'm going to change it over
so that me square is against the uh face
Edge follow the line
around and with a bit of luck we should
meet up again at the at the other side
pretty close
now the next thing to do is on the waist
side of the line this is our waist here
is to excavate out uh a shamer down to
that knife line so you need to make sure
that knife line was fairly deep so now
we're going to use a sharp
chisel just to cut down to that
line there we are
so you look what we've got in effect
there is that's the surface of our wood
we got the knife cat there and we got
that bit there like that and our saw is
going to sit into that bit
there okay all
right so we're using a fairly fine tooth
cross cut saw this is 16 teeth per
inch and we're going to start on the
corner there on that cut line and I'm
placing me index finger there just on
that edge so it's going to guide the saw
in it's going to help the saw not to
bounce around in that
line there we go and we've if we come in
close we can see how the start of the
sore cut
is on that line what I'm going to do now
having got that start I'm going to bring
the sord down onto the knife line
there we are so we should be pretty
Square there because our knife line was
Square all we got to worry about now is
being Square in the
vertical that first cut there is very
important because if you don't get that
right then if you're ever trying to get
back on line through the rest of the cut
right so let's extend it down through
the through to the end and hope you saw
in
square now you will notice
that my arm is dead in line with the
line of the so we don't want to be
standing like that so that we're soaring
with our arm at an angle cuz then the so
will bind in the curve so we're standing
like that it's a lot to do with position
with
stance and I've got my head with my eyes
above the blade so when I shut one eye I
can see one side of the blade when I
shut the other I can see the other side
of the
right let's see how I
did well that's not bad is it pretty
Square what are we doing that
way yeah see we're pretty square that
way as
well so as I say it's a lot about
stance getting your arm in line with the
saw
and it's getting that first few Strokes
right and then bringing your saw down
onto the knife
cut does take practice and sometimes
when I've not been soaring for a while I
I'll do a few s practice cuts to get me
eye in before I start doing it in
Earnest anyway I hope that improves your
soaring a bit
