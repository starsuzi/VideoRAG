hi guys I get asked quite often about
what to use if you are a beginner or if
you don't have all of the materials I
use there's one thing I use all of the
time while drawing with graphite pencils
and that's a blending stump so I thought
I'd show you how to make one yourself if
you don't have any I used some copy
paper and this paper size is A4
if you don't have a craft knife like
this you could just use some scissors

so now you will have one SI 10 cm and
the other side
8 and you will start rolling from the
larger
side try to roll as tight as you can
[Music]
[Music]
when you are done you can use some glue
or some tape like I did
[Music]
this one turned out a little too thick
so I decided to make one a bit
[Music]
[Music]
thinner so now you will have 11 CM on
one side and 9 cm on the other side with
a length of 20
cm the first one was a bit difficult to
roll up very tight so I figured I'd try
using some toothpicks to help
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now let's try them out
this is the one I just
made and this is the one I have bought
in the local art
store it works the same and it smudges
the graphite
[Music]
easily the blending stump I already had
is a bit dirty so that way the graphite
can get a bit darker if you to have a
dirty blending stump you can use the
extra graphite that's already on there
to
shade that's also how you clean your
blending stump if you want to just take
another piece of paper and smudge the
extra graphite on the paper until it's
[Music]
clean I use a blending stump after every
layer to create a smooth
effect if I don't want my graphite
darker but just want it smoother I
smudge it with a clean soft
tissue I hope this video can help you to
make your own blending stump I think
using a blending stump is really a must

pencils if this video was helpful give
