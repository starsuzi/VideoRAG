hey folks Philly boy Jay here back with
another video and today I'm going to be
showing you guys how I make my salmon
croates my family used to call them
salmon
patties what we're going to do first is
we're going to sauté our vegetables and
the reason that I sauté the vegetables
is because I find that when I add the
vegetables to the salmon mixture raw
they don't cook thoroughly so I like to
sauté them first then add them to the
salmon mixture
the vegetables that I'm going to be
using are red bell peppers green bell
peppers and onions you can customize
this recipe to your own liking if you
want to add more vegetables than that
like celery you can do so but I don't
like celery in my salmon patties I only
like red and green bell peppers and
onions so let's slice them up into small
pieces okay guys so where can see we
diced our vegetables up into really fine
pieces for the exact amount and
measurements to all the ingredients used
in this recipe visit my website at
phillyjaycooking.com all the detailed
instructions to this recipe can be found
there what we're going to do now is
we're going to sauté our vegetables so
let's get ready to move over to the
stove so you want to get your Skillet
and you're going to place it over high
heat
and the skillet we're going to add some
vegetable
oil now you may be wondering why I'm
adding so much but I'm adding a lot of
vegetable oil because we're going to be
frying our salmon in the same pan after
removing the
vegetables
okay so all of that oil is not just for
the vegetables all
right we going to let this get
[Applause]
hot we're going to stir them and sauté
them I say for about 2 minutes
and after 2 minutes which you're going
to do is you want to
drain some of the oil from the
vegetables so what you're going to do is
you're going to sit it on a paper tiled
plate all right to drain the excess
oil okay guys so what you're going to do
is you're going to get two cans of pink
salmon and I like like to use pink
salmon by bumblebee this is the kind
that I always use what you're going to
do is you're going to remove the top of
the
cans and you're going to
squeeze as much of the juice inside the
can out all
right so here is our salmon juice I'm
going
to use some of
that just to enhance the salmon flavor
we're not going to be using a lot of
it but about four to 5 tablespoons I
say okay we're going to drain the
rest the way I like to drain it is I
like to squeeze as much of the juice
from the salmon as possible so I just
press the top
down into the salmon like that and drain
all of the juice so press it as hard as
possible get all that juice
from out your salmon because you
want it to be as dry as possible so I'm
going to do that and then I'll get back
with you guys when I'm done to tell you
what you need to do
next so now that we drained the juice
from our salmon here's what you're going
to need to do we're going to remove the
skin it just looks so on the track
so
remove as much of this skin as possible
try not
to throw away too much meat but
remove the black skin should be rather
easy to scrape
off all this hair you want to remove
this
you don't have to remove every single
piece but you want to remove as much as
possible okay so now that we removed
most of the skin what you're going to do
is you're going to remove the bones now
you don't have to
remove the small bones like this here
but you want to
remove the long bones like this part
here see how long this one
us once to remove
that so remove this long piece of bone
right
here okay so now what you're going to do
is you're going
to chop your salmon
up and make it as fine as
possible okay
okay guys so what you're going to do is
you're going to melt some butter again
for the amount and measurements visit my
website at phillyjaycooking.com and what
we're going to do now is we're going to
add our
binding
ingredients and combine that with our
vegetables and salmon what we're going
to add to the mixing bowl first is our
egg
going to be using two of
them to the eggs we're going to add some
lemon
juice now if you don't have lemon juice
you can use lemon pepper
seasoning lemon and fish go perfectly
together we're going to add that that
salmon
juice just to enhance the fish
flavor we're going to add that melted
butter we're going to add our seasoning
salt
our garlic
powder I'm going to add some onion
powder even
though we're going to be adding the
chopped onions that we sauteed
earlier going to add some black
pepper some parsley
flakes you can add fresh parsley if you
like and last but not least we're going
to add some bread crumbs
[Music]
and we're going to add our vegetables
you have to make sure this is well
Blended because the breadcrumbs is
what's going to
help as I
said the patties stay
together all right guys so what we're
going to do now is we're going to shape
this mixture
into salmon patty
shapes and I don't usually make all of
this at once I just make a few salmon
patties and I wrap this up put in the
refrigerator and make some more the
following day or week or whenever I
decide I want some more salmon
patties but I'm going to show you guys
how I shap mine it's really
simple and
at this
point you can shape them how you
like but me personally I like my salmon
patties to
be small and flat I don't like really
thick salmon patties I like them to be
flat because when you place them in the
pan to fry they're going to rise a
little bit
anyway so if you shape them into thick
salmon patties they're going to be even
thicker once they're done all right but
it's totally up to you if you
like large salmon patties you can make
them that way but I like
minees flat and
small when they're flat and small they
um cook faster too I don't like salmon
patties that be like uncooked in the
middle I just don't like that so
I'm going to make about six for myself
and I'll get back with you guys once I'm
done all right guys so here's our salmon
patties I have the oil that we salate
our vegetables in earlier preheating and
we're going to be cooking our salmon
patties on medium high Heats
okay our oil is hot now so we're going
to add our salmon patties
three at a
time and by the way guys after we take
them out you're going to sit your salmon
patties on a paper tiled plate just like
you did your vegetables to drain the
excess oil
okay and what you're going to do is
you're going to need two
spatulas one for the bottom one for the
top so move it on to one
spatula and then you're going to flip it
over like
this then press
it P like that
okay that's another reason why I like to
make them small easier to
flip the long ones tend to break and
don't hold together as
well and there you go guys your salmon
patties these are
delicious I usually eat Salon patties
for breakfast that's the way I was
raised we only ate them for
breakfast so you're going to find this
recipe on my website in The Breakfast
section just to let you guys know all
right but these are amazing they're

need to make salmon patties any other
