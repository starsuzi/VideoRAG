Today I will be making kulfi.
An Indian eggless ice cream.
This is a simple and delicious dessert made with milk and sugar.
In summer days, kulfi is very popular with street vendors.
This is an easy recipe to prepare
and is an absolute treat to both young and old.
This recipe will make 6-8 kulfis.
To make kulfis we will need:
4 cups of milk
And 3/4 cup of heavy cream
3/4 cup of sugar
1/2 teaspoon of crushed cardamoms
1/2 teaspoon agar-agar (seaweed)
This is a vegetarian gelatin.
And available in Indian and Asian grocery store.
2 teaspoons of cornstarch
First I will boil the milk, heavy cream and sugar
together over medium high heat.
After it comes to boil I will reduce the heat to medium
and let it boil for 30-35 minutes
until milk has become about half in volume.
So letâ€™s get started.
Milk
Cream
Sugar
Mix it.
And let this come to boil over medium high heat.
Milk has started boiling.
So I will reduce the heat to medium.
And let it boil for about 30-35 minutes.
Until milk becomes half in volume.
Stir occasionally and keep cleaning the sides.
It has been about 35 minutes.
So milk is looking good.
And it is time to add the cornstarch.
And agar-agar.
And cardamom.
So first I am going to mix all these three things
with about 2 tablespoons of water.
Cornstarch
Agar-agar
And cardamom powder.
Mix it with about 2 tablespoons of water.
Mix it well so there are no lumps.
Agar-agar and cornstarch helps making milk creamy
and not having the icicles in kulfi.
Add the cornstarch mix.
Mix it well.
And let it boil for another 2 minutes.
Milk is boiling for 2 minutes.
It is ready to make kulfi.
I need to wait till it comes to room temperature
before I pour in the cups.
I am ready to pour the milk in the cups.
I am using the 3 oz plastic cup.
But you can use the popsicle or the kulfi molds.
This is the last one.
So I will freeze these cups for about 5 hours or longer.
Before kulfi will be ready.
Kulfi is looking great.
If you like you can flavor the kulfi with saffron or vanilla
and add the nuts of your choice.
My grandkids will be coming this evening and I know they will love it.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
