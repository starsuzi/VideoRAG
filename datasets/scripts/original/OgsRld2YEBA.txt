hi everyone welcome to my sewing room
I've been working on a quilt uh applie a
long curving Vine and I thought today
I'd quickly show you how to make those
Vines curve here's a quilt I made a
while back where the vine and the leaves
are kind of the main star there I took
the white panels um camping and on trips
they were really easy to carry around
and I applicate the vine and then I had
a bunch of scraps that I would just put
leaves different size leaves on the the
white panel and then when I was done
with four panels I put them together and
made a quilt and here's another quilt
using a curving Vine that I made with an
arc quilt
group so I have my busy fabric here and
I'm going to show you how easy it is to
make a Vine curve the key is to cut it
on the bias so this is the way you
normally have your fabric folded when
you're cutting strips of fabric you have
the salvages together so to make it
bias you fold on the diagonal putting a
bias and a raw Edge
together and put that
fold uh on one of the lines on
your cutting mat there and I'm going
going
to take my
ruler and you'll see the the longest
piece you can get would be from the
corner to corner down there I'm going to
cut right here
today making my Vine a little bit
shorter and I'm going to cut 1 and 1/4
in strip to make about a half an inch
wide Vine This 1 and 1/4 in will turn
out to be
a Vine that's about a half an inch and
I'll cut two strips just to show you
that it's very easy to join these strips
together to make it the length that you
want okay let's sit down at the sewing
machine and if you're wanting a long
Vine now is the right time to join these
together you can see how they kind of
fit like a puzzle right there I'm going
to cut off the Salvage so I don't have
that in there that's a little bit
thicker
typically so we don't want that in there
it's going to be thick enough put the
right sides together with a little tail
on each side and using your um smaller
Stitch your number two on my
machine I'm going to put those two
together and open the seam so it's not
too
bulky all right now I'm going to make my
Stitch really big as big as I can
because we're going to base this I'm
going to put fold both raw edges
in set it under my machine here and
start sewing this Vine
together I fold one Edge on top of the
other trying to get
both edges in that seam here
I fold as I
go fold a little bit and then a little
bit more
okay I'm going to stop right
there I'm done basting my
Vine and now I'm going to get the fabric
that I'm going to bit to um applique on
here it
is starting on one
Edge I'm going to lay the raw edges down
hide them
underneath and I'm going to start
pinning you may be using a pattern or
you might be just doing this on your own
so just I usually just let it curve
I'm not usually following a
pattern but it'll curve any way you want
it to curve if you uh go to the ironing
board you can also curve and press as
you go
onto your um backing there all right now
the next step is you're going to
applique you can either do it by hand
using a tiny Stitch which really doesn't
take that long
or you can sit down at your
machine and do a stitch along both edges
of
this let's see if we
can I usually start at the bottom right
here right along the
edge you can
sew okay you got the idea the last thing
you want to do is I have one all done
right
here I already applicated on my machine
the last thing to do is you do not want
that ugly basting stitch there in the
middle you want to remove
that so I have some scissors
here and I just make a little cut here
and there along that basting
stitch and then I'm going to try to just
pull that one piece out
it's usually pretty
easy so remove the basting stitch and
you'll have a nice appliqued
Vine thank you for joining me in my
sewing room today
