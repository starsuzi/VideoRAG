hey everybody Kevin Drake with App
plance Factory in mattress Kingdom with
one of the easiest hacks you'll ever
know I've been using this hack I think
probably since I'm 15 I'm 51 do the math
do you ever have onion smell on your
hand you can't get rid of it you use
soap it never goes away you your eyes
are all watering after cut uh cutting
onions here's the easiest way to beat it
once you start to cut the onion take a
stainless steel knife it could be the
knife you've been cutting the onions
with if you want let the water run off
of the stainless steel onto your hands
and just like that no smell on your
hands no smell in the air no watery eyes
look this is easy try it it really works
