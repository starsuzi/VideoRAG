in today's video we'll be dealing with a
clogged garbage disposal obviously the
first thing you want to do is you want
to check on the bottom make sure there's
no restrictions inside of there here we
have our garbage disposal tool do is
you're going to insert your key on the
bottom and you're going to rotate it
so right now i don't have any
restrictions
i don't feel anything causing the blades
to grind or grab this is my reset button
it hasn't popped so this tells me the
garbage disposal is running but most
likely i have something clogged in the
lines
if you want to remove any restrictions
from the garbage disposal if you feel
like there's a jam or if your reset
button has been pushed or reset go ahead
and go to my channel i do have a link
posting showing you how to clear up the
restrictions see here when i turn the
garbage disposal on
the gar disposal will run but you'll see
all the water slosh around
we're going to do is we're going to
loosen our p-trap
there's going to be a little bit of
water inside of here
so we're just gonna dump that
see there is some sediment that came out
of the p-trap or if you look here you
can see that there's still a restriction
in my sink on the garbage disposal side
here we have a divider in this pipe so
whenever you use your water on the
regular side
where the guard disposal is not
connected the water will bypass it'll
actually go through the p-trap and shoot
up through the main drain
whereas in here where the garbage
disposal is there's going to be a little
divider inside of here and what happens
is if you put
pasta rice
or something that can restrict it and
get clogged up that will keep the water
from actually draining out the p-trap a
little bit of messy so
here what we're going to do is i'm going
to actually loosen this right here and
see if i can get the water to pour out
you may want to back up and have some
towels ready because once you open this
all that pressure is just going to come
force it it's going to come rushing out
here was i removed my washer nut
and now i'm going to slowly pull in the
pipe and see if i can get a little bit
of water to come out
i'm gonna be very careful you can see
here i'm holding the pipe
and you can see all of that build up
right there
inside of my drain this is the other end
of the pipe
what we're gonna do is we're to hit this
we're trying to try to remove
all of that build up and you can see
right there dividers cleared out
now our pipe is open i'm going to turn
the water on just kind of spray all this
see if i can get it through the garbage
disposal
[Music]
i do recommend is
getting rid of
the water that you removed from the
piping
by
getting rid of the liquid in the toilet
and taking the actual rice or pasta and
throwing it away in the garbage can now
we're going to reconnect our piping
run our water
on the garbage disposal
