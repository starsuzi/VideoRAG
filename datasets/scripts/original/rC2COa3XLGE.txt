So, I'm going to show you how to frost cupcakes
using an American buttercream and a spatula.
So, what you want to do is, you want to take
your cupcake and you're actually going to
turn your cupcake clockwise or counterclockwise.
It doesn't matter as long as it's actually
going around.
And at the same time, you're going to take
your spatula and you're going to tap on the
top of the cupcake.
That's essentially how you're going to do
it.
So, now, I'm going to show you with the frosting.
So, we're going to take our frosting in a
bowl, and you're going to swipe it back and
forth.
And what that swiping is doing is actually
getting rid of all the air bubbles to make
it nice and smooth.
Once we have it smooth, you're going to clean
off your spatula.
You're going to grab some of the frosting
on the side, and you're just going to round
it out to make a nice round ball on the end
of your spatula.
Take your cupcake, and while turning, you're
going to tap that frosting on... until you
have it on all the way.
And you're going to stop when you still see
some of the cupcake on there.
You're going to push in, in the middle, and
turn and lift at the same time so we have
that nice pretty swirl in there.
So, that's essentially how you're going to
frost the cupcake using buttercream.
If you want, you can change it up by adding
some simple decorations, some dragees, you
can do sprinkles, some fresh fruit, or even
some nuts on top.
