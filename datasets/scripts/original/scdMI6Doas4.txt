 
Hey everyone, Rubber
Band Designs here.
We are doing the third
video in our nine-part video
series of Basic
Rubber Band bracelets.
So let's get started on doing
a fishtail bracelet today.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
For this bracelet, you need one
loom, one hook, one c-click,
and 50 rubber bands.
You do it with a variety
of different colors
if you would like.
I'm just choosing two colors.
You actually only
are going to need
two of the pegs for this one.
So we can turn
our pegs sideways.
You want to make sure the
opening is to the right.
So you have the
solid on the left
and the little hole on
the right, just like this.
We're going to take
our first color
and loop it on two of the pegs.
But first, we need to twist it
into a figure eight, just one
simple twist and hook it on.
Push it all the way down.
And then we're going to add
two more of the same color.
Push those down.
 
Now, you're going to
need to get your hook.
You're going to take
your hook and you're
going to hook the bottom band
on the left of the crisscross
where it's crissed right here.
We're going to take
the bottom left of it,
we're going to pull it up, and
let go of it in the center.
And then we're going to do the
same thing on the other side.
 
Then, I'm going to go ahead and
push my rubber bands back down.
 
And now, I'm going
to add my next color.
I'm going to do mine in
a pattern of three rubber
bands per color.
Now, you're going to take
your bottom rubber band,
pull it up and over.
Let go in the center,
in seam with that one.
Whoops.
There it goes.
And then push these down again.
 
Make sure every time you weave
and put your rubber bands up
at the top, you want to
push down your other ones,
so you have room to put
on your next rubber band.
 
You can go ahead and start
seeing the design come out
already a little bit.
It might take a
little bit though
for you to really get
the sense of the design.
 
And that was my third
color on that one.
So now I'm back to red.
I think counting
the rubber bands
and making sure that I'm only
doing three of each color,
it's kind of the most difficult
part to get the hang of.
But once you've done it
once, the next couple
of times that you do
it will be a breeze.
 
And you can already see the
fishtail design happening,
so we're just going to
keep on going through this,
alternating every three bands
with our different colors.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Now that I have run out of
rubber bands to put on here,
we're going to finish
it up just like we would
if we had more rubber
bands to put on.
But instead we're going
to take our c-clip,
and we are going to attach
it to that last rubber band
that we unlooped over the pegs.
 
Make sure you get
both sides of it.
And then we are going to
take this off of our pegs,
and bring up the two first loops
of our very first rubber band
that we did.
If I can get up--
there it goes--
and we're going to
hook that as well.
 
And then you can just take
out those last two extra one
that were hanging there.
And here you go.
Here is our fishtail bracelet.
This is our third video
