It seems that there's always something new
in the hair treatment world.
Every day a new tip that promises to fix all
of your health and hair issues pops up on
the Internet.
Like, for example, did you ever think that
you might one day wash your hair in beer?
This drink has become quite popular due to
the fact that it is great at hydrating your
hair strands.
Studies have revealed that beer improves the
strength of your hair, gives it shine, hydrates,
nurtures, and even improves volume.
You're probably wondering how this is possible.
These benefits are mostly due to the ingredients
used to make beer and their nutrients.
Beer contains biotin, which can increase volume
and strength.
In this case, the darker the beer, the better.
The calcium, iron, and copper found in beer
can preserve your hairâ€™s natural color and
prevent hair loss.
Malt and hops boost shine and hydrate.
Vitamin B and magnesium can also improve your
hair's appearance.
Another advantage of beer is that, when it
comes in contact with your scalp, it helps
your blood to circulate better, which in turn
will promote growth.
Are you thinking about trying it out?
Well here's how:
First, use bottled beer.
It doesn't need to be cold for this treatment.
Next, remove the alcohol from the beer.
Since alcohol evaporates faster than water,
all you have to do is heat the beer up until
the alcohol has all evaporated.
Then, when you go to take a shower, apply
your shampoo as normal and rinse it out.
Then, pour the warm beer all over your hair.
Let it sit for a few minutes then rinse it
out.
Your strands may feel a little hard after
this treatment, so we recommend using conditioner
afterwards.
