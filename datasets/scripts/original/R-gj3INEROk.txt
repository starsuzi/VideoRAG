uh ginseng's gonna die off after the
first Frost so I need to get out before
the frost hits
what we have here is a mature
three prong this is a legal ginseng
plant
the berries are already gone off of it
where you find one ginseng plant and
probably going to find another
here we have it here's that mature one
right here
On My Feet
it's growing underneath the log it's
right here
ought to have a good root on it now I'm
gonna try to be a He-Man and
move that log but I can't so
try to get in underneath it here
you gotta be careful in a situation like
this easily break that root off
move your foot hun
yeah
there now we've got to be able to get to
it
don't want to break that root off
all right
see that's more of what we're looking
for is a bulb type roof I did root did
break the stem off and
try to avoid that if you can we'll just
go ahead and put that in our pouch but
that's more the type of weed you're
looking for right there
not the long and slender one like we had
previously
all right here's a another one
it's a mature one
you know sometimes
you'll find ginseng plants that are This
Tall those things are decades old
so we'll go ahead and dig this one
now
you know you really gotta practice good
conservation skills with this or there
won't be
student thing to come but
now this is a mature plant but again a
long slender one
has a lot to do with the soil so
not always going to find the perfect
ones he might be docked a little bit for
the price of this one but
it'll be all right here's another one
right over here
this point appears on
the only song the ones broke off let me
see where it came off here
so we'll go ahead and
dig that one
over here
that's a deep one
now it's a big old root too
now it appeared to be a big root but
no but that's why you're after
it's not a long slender one has a little
character to it
all right now here's a good mature plant
now it's uh turning gold
as fall progresses these plants are
going to turn gold there's no better
sight than walking into the woods and
just seeing a sea of gold
but
of course
I don't happen very often but
when it does it's pretty cool
and I think yeah my wife
a lot of this one
I got The Knack now he's got the Knack
got the eye
Eagle Eye Eagle Eye she's old Eagle Eye
he damn right
so it's the root what it looks like
hopefully you got the right one not the
other ones yeah I don't know what a
which route it was I think actually
there it is right there
it's all right okay we've just been out
here talking about ginseng but there's
so many different plants that can be uh
dug and sold for medicinal purposes
right here is a Goldenseal plant golden
seal yellow root whatever you want to
call it
right there is what that looks like I I
dig a lot of that every year
I mean this year I've got about 35
dollars a pound for the root
and I think the tops dry tops are going
for a
five dollars a pound now this is the end
of the season for this and it's really
the last
green one I've seen in the fourth
and there's some yellow ones like here
but
now when you get that washed up it's
going to be just as gold as can be
and if you look over in the distance
by that tree
sticking out like a sore thumb
this is again from the plant now this is
I mean you can just see them from a
distance right here
makes it easy to
make it easy to dig and they stick out
like that
now that is a long Splendor root
that's all the bigger it's going to get
in this soil condition
hold it up again
okay
all right we're able to get a few Roots
here I'm going to just show you a little
bit about
washing them the main thing with the
gold ginseng th you don't want to over
wash them you just want to get the mud
the dirt off of them you don't want to
polish them white
once I get in my washed I'll set them
out in the sun let them dry
10 15 minutes just get the moisture off
then I'll take them in the house I'll
lay them like in a cardboard box
spread them out Eric can get to them let
them dry inside now there's a lot of
moisture in one of these roosters
they're not going to dry overnight about
three pounds of wet is going to equal a
pound of dry
so it's going to take a lot of roots to
make a pound
Roots can sell anywhere from I've seen
as low as 300 a few years ago I seen up
to twelve hundred dollars a pound
so we'll get these washed
get them drying
and eventually get them to uh
Market I'm going to try to hold off this
year let the price go up a little bit
right now I think it's about 400 a pound
dry
sometimes you can sell wet and for a
little bit more money
you know it's just a gamble you never
know what price it was going to do it's
kind of like the stock market so we'll
get these dry and
washed and drying and
go from there
[Music]
foreign
folks is about all you want to do you
don't want to overwash these roots
that's about all you
that's about all you want right there
let me get the rest of these washed and
get them in the sand and dry for about
15 minutes take them in the house let
them finish drying and take several
weeks for them to dry
I'm going to take a second here and show
you that golden seal root I dug yellow
root golden seal whatever you might have
but there it is you see how that's just
real golden
it's about I think like I said about
three dollars a pound this year is what
I'm selling that for
reads up to five or I'm sorry the tops
right tops about five a pound
planning for
don't sell as high as
ginseng but there's a lot more of it in
a lot of woods
all right we got this uh
ginseng has been on the Sun for a little
bit drying we've got most of the
moisture off I'm gonna go ahead and put
it in a cardboard box
ginseng is the only route that I know of
they do not want to dry out in the sun
has to be dried in the house
and honestly I cannot tell you why
but make sure it's
spread apart
like that
I know that's not a lot of ginseng I
just wanted to go out this morning dig
it a little bit and show you what it's
all about I'll show you some dry
ginsength here folks
that's some dry ginseng
I mean it's
brittle I mean well it's not brittle
this is brittle this is hard there's no
softness to it none whatsoever
foreign
so that's your sellable
ginseng right there folks
and this is as well if you want to sell
it wet
all right I hope you enjoyed that learn
