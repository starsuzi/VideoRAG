Hi guys is Ants Britania and today, I'm going to be showing you how to make a tropical formicarium for your ants.
So guys, to make this formicarium you're obviously going to need to buy a few bits and few bits of materials
so I went to my local pet store and
My local pet store is called pets at home. Some of you guys in the UK
Might know might know the pet store. This is where I purchased this tank here.
It only costs 15 pounds. It's not too bad. It's waterproof
Which is a perfect or a tropical formicarium, because there's gonna be a lot of humidity?
And I am actually going to be creating a small kind of pond or lake in this formicarium. I also bought some
substrate; some sand for the formicarium
for the pond
And I've also got some kind of soil leftover from when I did my trap jaw
formicarium, I've also purchased a
hygrometer I think that's how you pronounce it but
hygrometer basically measures humidity in the formicarium
Which is essential when keeping tropical ants because you want to make sure you have the correct humidity
Type of ant species that you have so yeah, I am went to my local garden center
That's basically where you can buy plants
here in the UK and I don't know the specific names for these plants
But this is called a Fattonia, but I know
Hopefully look quite nice in the tropical formicarium
That I'm planning to make. I actually keep a couple of Fattonia's in my house here
And they are very strong and out of all the plants I've kept
They tend to grow the quickest and they have to survived through everything. They are very tough plants
I also purchased
Some Gravel
now the gravels in this kind of blue sieve here
 
The gravel will came in a small kind of pack, it's for aquariums, but it came in a small pack and I
soaked the
gravel in this container here over 24 hours overnight and
in
Some water and then I proceeded to rinse the gravel under some under some water
this is just this is essentially just to get rid of any kind of dust that may be sitting on top or around the
Gravel. You don't really want that in
Formicarium. You want the water as clear as possible
And as clean as possible
I'm also going to use some of this coco brick. I used, as you can see half is gone because I use half of it in my
Trap Jaw ant formicarium
So if you guys haven't seen at my trap jaw ants, I'll leave a link below in the description. I made a nice little video
Showcasing their arrival, and how I kind of set up there formicarium
If you guys are planning on keeping an exotic species of ant, that might be a good kind of starter video for you to watch
But this will help you out if you want to create
Your Tropical Formicarium. So guys, We'll start by adding in our base layer of gravel
Now this will hold the water quite well at the bottom of the tank because sometimes if you just put in
Soil, or sand at the bottom
And then add a lot of moisture it can create some kind of mold and compressed mud at the bottom of the tank which
Smell rather bad, so don't tend to one bone, so it's good to create a smooth base layer of gravel
Then I'm gonna lay over a small sheet of plastic which has a few holes in it. This will keep the rocks
Separated from from the sand and the soil. It will keep most of it seperated from the sand and soil
It will just allow a good separation of the substrates. I don't really want any kind of sand or soil
Slipping through the cracks and the robbers crack down mud at the bottom
But let's get cracking guys and let's get creative
Okay, let's we're gonna turn my here trying to do this now, but make it an absolutely met
But I'm gonna try and make it try and just lay in this here at the bottom here
Now as some people may know who have aquariums. I have like a little aquarium you can
See behind me if you guys want to
see a
kind of video on my abrasion
Just let me know in the comment that you want to see we shall confer as some people may know with aquariums you tend to
Make the bottle too popular tank
reasonably high and then you back the tank high and that makes the front of the tank where
You put most visibility what though this creates like a sense of dip
In the in the tank makes it look bigger than it actually is
So I'm going to try
The same process with my thumb carry minute. I will try and create the pot the front and the tank
Which is usually hopefully be at the lowest point if I was part of the tank itself
So guys I've created a kind of foundation layer
This is about a centimeter deep so now I'm going to start shaping the graben of the land as to the landscape
I want to create
So guys I've got the back end of the tank saw in so where the pond is going
I'm just gonna create a small opening for the front here
Okay guys now all of our gravel in place where we want it
So as you can see is a slight slant in the tank whether the back of the tank is a lot higher than
The front of the tank and are created just in
Semicircle at the front of the tank where st. Louis where I plan to create the small pond
okay, guys next step I
cut out some
plastic from a
Packet that was around some blue rolls
That's some toilet rolls, and I'm going to lay it it round over the top of most of this gravel
Even the bottom of the pod just to separate the substrates try and make it
Invisible around the sides because you don't really want to see
Bits of plastic around the side of the tank, so I'm gonna try and separate a little
Now we've added in our plastic kind of sheeting over the top of our gravel
Now I'm going to proceed with adding in the sand for the pond for the bottom the pond
this will kind of give it a more on that fistic feel and
Sand has really good filtration with a filter into the rocks quite well around the sides and everything so
Let's go ahead and add that I bought myself some
Some desert sands. This is made by pets at home. It's their own brand. It's it's not fine
It's quite quite a thick sound which is good as it means if the ants
wish to move it about they can sometimes the problem is with fine sand it can get quite dusty and
As sometimes struggled to walk on it the sound this is very good for all kinds of phone carriers because it has a great contrast
to
all colored kind of ants
Unless they're sand covered of course
Okay, so
I've got the sound now where I want it. Just around the basin of the pond and as you can see here
I've placed the sand at the front of the tank right guys now. It's time to add in our swim
I'm going to add this around sand around the edges here, okay
So we're gonna be adding in some plants all first, so this is some house plant compost
This is specific for these kind of like houseplants these kind of plants. I'm really putting in the formal karyam and
This compost will have the required nutrients minerals for those plants to grow successfully if you guys are thinking about keeping
Live plants in your former Carians be sure to get right
so
specific for your plan
So guys I've added in all the plants all the I require and as you can see here. We're not salon there where
The back is a lot deeper
Than the front this will obviously create some kind of debt
In the form of areum's I can't really be showcased at the moment cuz we don't have anything in the tank
But now I'm just going to go ahead and add a little bit more sand just to cover up this plastic here
So guys I've added in some more, Sam and it's starting to look like a good foundation
from former Carrie Amir
it's good to add a variety of substrate because then your hands can kind of choose as well as
What temperature they like humidity they like they can also choose what?
Material to build build into so here. I've kind of given them a good choice
between quite a fine sand and quite
Thick soil, so it's completely up to them as to where they dig and build the nest now
It's time to add our
plants into our small formal carry over here and
I'm going to try and repeat the same kind of process
And keep the smaller plants
Towards the front or the foam cam and the large plants towards the back
So let's go ahead and add some bees plants it
I don't know the specific names of these plants if you do know the name of these plants to help people out it would be
Fantastic if you wrote a comment in the comment section below just let people know what the plant is called alright
Let's add these plants in
With a stomach by handing
This to
Tonio plan now I didn't know it was called that I just literally looked at the label
Of love well so to be good
So guys I think we're all done in all the plants and
It's starting to look like a naturalistic
Tropical formic area and as you can see here. It looks absolutely beautiful
So guys I'm extremely happy with the way things turned out so far
So we kind of next step for me is to add some kind of rain forest litter and the top of the soil here
To make a bit more naturalistic to the end, okay, so I'm going to use some EXO terror
Rain forest substrate, hopefully give it that rain forest meal
Right now we've got our
All of our substrate layers. We've got our parabola
We've got our plant soil
We've got our sand through our pond
And we've got our kind of rain forest litter on the surface of our soil here and of course
We've got our plants so guys
This is the complete foundation of our tropical form aquarium finished
so all we need to add now is just a little bit of water and a little bit of heat to step and
That's humidity, and then we are all done, so let's go ahead and add the water
I've got my water and I've got this plastic kind of a cutout piece of plastic here of the container
Which has a hole through the bottom of it
I am basically gonna pour water into that small container, and it's gonna flood down through the hole
It's just so I don't disturb the substrate too much because if I obviously pour the soup bowl winter
Into the form tab it might move the soil Makalu the plants around and make it
Make it look a bit less attractive. So this is a good way or keep it on substrate where you want it
Hopefully this doesn't go horribly wrong, but we're gonna find out
Oh
Maybe using the huge bowl is not good idea and we've back with you in two seconds with a smaller bowl
Okay guys
so I
Managed to find this jug which is actually perfect for the kind of job that I need need to do
Never use the wrong tools for the wrong jump obviously
Lesson learned there by me
So nice after adding in the last bit of water. We're finally finished of tropical for Macario and
for those say so myself are they extremely happy with the way this has turned out it is truly a
recreation of a
tropical environment
So guys that is pretty much how to make a truck called former karyam? I?
honestly, hope this video helped any
Potential exotic and keepers out there
My when I first started keeping in God's hands
I didn't really have an idea of what to create what to put them in because obviously their environment is completely different to
European environment, so if you're living in Europe or like the UK like me
It is always a great idea to create your own little tropical cell like this
but if you're thinking of creating a nest to be attached to this if you just wanna use it as an out well I
Did make a new little video on how to create a plaster form karyam fast plus wind currents are usually really good. They have
Good filtration, so the water will hydrate the net really well
I'll leave a link below in the description if you want to check out that plants in this video
We can come in handy
You wish to just make
An additional nest for your aunt's so guys all I need to do now in terms of this nest just add a heat map underneath
I'm gonna add my
hygrometer the AMIA which detects humidity good place on the glass and
Bob's your uncle and I'm finished it's been a pleasure making it
Home care of it here and a pleasure showing you guys how to make it. It's not just been
Me showing you guys how to make something I've learned if you think myself as well
so that's always great when you you learn something as well, so guys I
upload videos every
Single weekend. There's no specific day or time
But we can do compete might be dopants come up at any point in other weekend
If you find yourself liking at this video be sure to hit that subscribe button
Hit the belly button as well because that will notify you when my video has been uploaded for cause and next week
We are going to be moving a tropical and species into this former area
Now that will be revealed in next week's videos so be sure to tune in for that
I hope you enjoyed this video and have a great weekend, and I'll see you next week
And I also purchased a hygrometer to mention humidity in the air from Karen, which is essential if you want
