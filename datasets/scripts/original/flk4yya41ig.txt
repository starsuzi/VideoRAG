welcome to web shaft and today spring is
in the air and the fiddle heads are
sprouting up from the ground I'm going
to show you how to prepare fresh fiddle
heads that I had picked from my
backyard you want to remove the uh brown
leaf flakes from the Fiddle Head these
flakes help prevent the Fiddle Head from
Spring Frost so let's uh give it a good
rinse cut off the brownish ends and
let's rinse it
thoroughly you want to be gentle when
you're cleaning out the uh coil part of
your Fiddle Head rinse it out real
good there you
go let's do some
more
cut off the uh brownish ends and get in
there and clean and
rinse rinse it through thoroughly you
want to get all those flakes
out be gentle so it doesn't break but
that's okay if it breaks you just keep
cleaning and move on to the next
one that looks good let's finish it off
bring your pot of water to a boil I have
mine on about uh medium high heat and
we're going to uh steam our fiddle
heads let them Steam for about 15
minutes if you want to use your uh
fiddle heads in a stir fry you'll have
to uh blanch your fiddle heads in
boiling water for about a minute or if
you want to boil your fiddle heads
boiling for 8 to 10
minutes looks good let's serve the
steamed fiddle
heads I'm going to use a glove here
because this uh wooden steamer gets uh
pretty hot
sometimes this is going to be really
delicious let's top off the uh fiddle
heads with a little bit of
butter
some
lemon just to give it a little bit of uh
tartin to
it salt and
pepper just uh sprinkle it
on and to uh finish it off we're going
to uh use some Parmesan cheese here
we're just going to uh put a little bit
of a dusting on top of
it and there you have it steam
