so to make this one we need sixty
percent coconut milk
thirty percent mold you know mold yes
malt in vietnam we make from wheat
and it's very sticky
only 10 percent sugar we don't mix with
a lot of sugar because sugar candy is
very very sweet not really nice and if
we make candy just including coconut
milk and sugar candy cannot become
caramel like this one
mulch can make candy become caramel and
then we start within 45 minutes that
time we cannot leave candy because if we
leave it and candy very hard so we have
to stay here within 45 minutes
and in countryside you will see people
recycle everything
kind of time we have a lot of
we have a big piece
and then we cut into small pieces
although it's still hot very hot but
when we cut it into small pieces and
then we make it become the long line
this one very easy
and when we finish this step we leave it
about 10 minutes you know that candy
becomes kind of cooler
and then we check out after that we jump
into small pieces like that one
[Music]
and now in here you will see people wrap
candy with rice paper
because after two days
candy release a lot of oil
rice paper collect oil from coconut
candy and this one very simple just rice
flour and water and the one you see that
make my machine
if the rice paper makes my hand thicker
so later when you fry you can drain
loading rice paper just make some rice
flour and water and now please would you
like to fry some chocolate candy
i'm eating up coconut candy and
i just bought
some candy
um
this is
coconut pasta
with this one we can make coconut mat
you never see coconut nuts
fruit
after that
with coconut fresh one we used to choose
coconut juice
you know around here people plant a lot
of coconut trees because when visitors
come to their house they don't bring a
lot of coke
they just invite them coconut juice
and with coconut leaf they can make the
room of the house yes
coconut tree because in here we have a
lot of rivers of canals you know
in countryside people don't use machine
to coconut flesh into small pieces
everything they just make my hands when
they can have coconut fruit already
after that break it and
when we want to collect coconut milk we
have to choose dry coconut because the
dry one has a thick flesh and this one
we can collect coconut milk if the young
one just gonna choose
coconut milk
and then we use this stone to cut
coconut into
coconut flesh from coconut shell
normally coconut in this position like
this
before use the knife
move around like this and then they can
separate coconut fruit and
gonna flash in coconut shell
when they can separate any use machine
you can coconut flesh into small pieces
when i have this one already and then
it's sweet to collect coconut milk and
we put every coconut flesh in the mint
you know that when we sweet corn splash
will not fall down
