- Hi, I'm Jerry James
Stone and in today's video,
I'm gonna show you how to make
slow cooker caramelized onions.
Now, I love caramelized onions
but you have to sit there at the stove
and they only come out if you do it slow
and really take your time
but it's a good like 45 minutes or so
that you're gonna be
standing over a pan of onions
but if you do 'em in the slow cooker,
you don't have to do that.
Just throw 'em in and 10 hours later,
so you just do it overnight,
boom, tasty, delicious slow cooker onions.
I'm also gonna walk you
through some of the science
on how caramelized onions
actually come to be
like what's happening, how did
it get so delicious and why?
So let's get to that.
Okay, I'm gonna show you how to make 'em.
Real, real easy.
So when you're prepping your
onions for caramelization,
something that's really important
is you wanna get them about
equal in shape and size.
If you have uneven slices of onion
throughout your batch of onions
then some of those slices
are gonna caramelize
a lot faster than the other ones
and you're gonna have an uneven
batch of caramelized onions.
So just try to get them as
similar as you possibly can.
You don't have to bust out a ruler.
You don't have to be
anal-retentive about it
but you definitely wanna try to get them
as similar as you possibly can
and try not to cut yourself
while you're doing it
unless you're into that sort of thing.
(calm music)
Now, you can caramelize almost any onion.
In fact, really any onion
but I'll tell you that
you probably wanna avoid
caramelizing red onions because
the pigment in red onions
actually changes as a result of acidity
so when you're caramelizing the onions,
those red onions and I
do love the red onions.
I just love that flavor.
They're so crisp and bright
but when you caramelize them,
they actually turn a grayish purple
once they're fully caramelized
and you definitely don't want that
so I recommend using a white onion
or a yellow onion versus a red one.
So the next thing you wanna do
once you chop all your onions
is to coat them with some oil.
A good rule of thumb is you
want about a tablespoon of oil
for every couple of onions.
You wanna make sure all of
the onions are fully coated
and then just stir them around.
You don't have to be
perfect about it here.
(calm music)
Those are looking pretty good.
Next, you wanna mix in some salt.
You want about an eighth of a
teaspoon for every two onions.
(calm music)
Just mix that in.
Now, we're gonna transfer
this to the Crock-Pot.
Now, just transfer your
onions to the Crock-Pot
and you're gonna cook this
on low for about 10 hours
stirring it occasionally if you can
but I recommend just doing it overnight
so if you happen to be a sleepwalker,
that's a good time to stir 'em.
And these onions are
looking pretty darn good.
Now, every slow cooker can
be a little bit different
so I would say that the first
time you do this recipe,
you might wanna do it not overnight
just so you can kinda get a
feel for how it's working.
When I first did it myself,
I had to adjust the heat a
little bit for the slow cooker.
You can also see that there's
a lot of liquid left here.
I personally recommend
the last hour or two
leaving the lid ajar just so
that some of that can bake off
and it'll make a really
jammy caramelized onion
or you can just use it straight that way
if you don't wanna have to deal with it
but that's how you make these
slow cooker caramelized onions
and they just look pretty amazing, right?
And that's all there is.
Like I said, chop a few onions,
throw 'em in the slow cooker,
set it up, let it go overnight.
10 hours later, you have
some tasty, delicious
slow cooked onions perfectly caramelized.
Great for pizza.
Great for burgers.
Great for omelets.
Great for whatever.
I think you're gonna really like 'em.
