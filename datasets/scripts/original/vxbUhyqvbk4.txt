used furniture shops in the city are a
gold mine for me i know a great place in
queens where i'm sure i can find
something for this project i'm working
on
this time i want to repurpose an old
piece into a set tee
pedero damn how you doing brother good
to see you again brother likewise any
new stuff oh man all the time every day
i'm looking for like a settee a small
sofa small sofa sati well we got the
sofas over here okay on this side
shipment comes in every day so you never
know what's going to be coming around
awesome size wise i'm thinking something
like this yeah this is a it's pretty
complicated very nice huh this is the
piece that really sticks out it might be
too big but it's something that it's
beautiful it's it's a great piece it's
too long
too long that might be a problem we can
go downstairs and see what we have
downstairs and we can uh just head down
there right now if you want to hit it
yeah let's go
the work area is back here
haven't you ever been back here this is
my little my little treasure chest my
little like
no one really comes back here except the
vip the vip section well i like to dig
so
yeah this is the space this is a this is
the bad boy over here look at the the
old cast man this is a beautiful teeth
and it's mobile is that like a lavender
here i need to polish it up make it look
real good spray it in color you know
it's perfect size like a two seater
i think it could be a settee for real
really remove the top take these drawers
out leave the bottom one for storage i
know it's an old antique so it's going
to have a solid base
it's easy working with you man
when i was looking for a city at the
furniture market i didn't have much luck
but i found this dresser that's almost
to the point of no return
so i'm gonna take it apart put it back
together and create a city out of it so
the first thing we're gonna do is remove
this top
it's an old piece so these are obviously
flat head screws
all right we're loose because it's an
antique on the underside of the top
you've got the year and the date that it
was made
so september
september 1909.
it's pretty
pretty impressive
and as we're disassembling you'll notice
how well this thing's put together so i
actually enjoyed the disassembly process
quite a bit part of me hates tearing
this up but knowing that it's going to
have a second life as a seti you know
keeps me focused on the prize
i just need to measure
the actual space that's gonna fit in
here
so even though i'm going to paint this
entire piece and this will get covered
with pillows i'm going to frame this out
and poly it so that we preserve that
original stamp showing the history of
the piece so i'll just glue the seed in
because this piece had a pre-existing
finish on it i'm going to sand it down
before i paint so that the paint really
grabs the wood
just going to paint the drawer to match
the rest of the piece
that's it a satie with style and a story
we'll just let the paint dry throw some
cushions on maybe some handles on the
drawer and it's done
cheese
