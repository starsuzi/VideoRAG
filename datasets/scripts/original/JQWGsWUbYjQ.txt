Holley's iNTECH cold air intakes not only
increase horsepower and torque, but the large
high flow air filters are also washable and
reusable.
When dirt collects on your filter element,
performance is diminished, this is a time
to clean your air filter element.
Holley's iNTECH washable air filter cleaner
restored the performance of your filter's
element and brings it back to like-new conditions.
It is specially formulated to clean dirt and
grime from your iNTECH synthetic air filter.
It comes in a convenient 32-ounce spray bottle
for multiple cleanings.
We recommend that you inspect your filter
element every 6 months or more if you drive
in dry, dusty conditions.
Cleaning your air filter element is easy,
remove the air filter from the housing and
intake tube.
Gently shake and tap the filter to remove
all the excess debris and dirt particles.
Spray a generous amount of cleaner directly
onto each side of the air filter, applying
more to heavily soiled areas.
Allow the cleaner to soak for ten minutes,
do not allow to dry.
Always use cool to warm temperature water,
hot water is not recommended.
Rinse the filter from the clean side through
to the dirty side.
Light water pressure helps cleaning the filter.
Reapplication of the iNTECH cleaner may be
necessary until the water flowing through
the media is clear of dirt.
Do a final rinse and shake excess water from
the air filter and allow to air dry.
You may use compressed air to speed this process,
holding the nozzle twelve inches from the
filter surface.
Remember, iNTECH air filters do not use oil,
simply let the air filter air dry and reinstall.
Reinstall by reversing the removal process.
Proper cleaning ensures proper airflow and
performance, make sure to use the right cleaner
the next time you need to service your iNTECH
air filter.
