hi everybody and welcome back to cook
and share today in this episode we're
doing up a leftover turkey casserole I
don't know how many times I've made up a
big turkey there's tons left over and I
couldn't think of anything to do with it
but turkey sandwiches so here's a unique
idea for you so let's get
started so what I've got here is about
half a cup of hot chicken stock now I'm
going to add in the Crea mushroom soup
and give it a stir until it's well
combined so what I'm going to do is pour
the soup into a casserole
dish then I'll just take my leftover
turkey here and lay it on top of the
soup now if you want to include the skin
in here as well it's entirely up to you
but I just kind of like the
meat so I'll just take my spoon and give
this a little m mix just to make sure
the soup covers the
meat okay now what I'm going to do is
add the stuffing over top of the chicken
so what I've got here is simply some
Stove Top Stuffing but of course if you
got leftover stuffing you're going to
want to use
it until I get a nice deep even layer
just about like
this now I'm going to slip a piece of
aluminum foil over the top just to
prevent it from drying
out and we'll put this into a 350Â°
preheated oven for about 40
minutes after 40 minutes we're going to
remove it from the oven and grate a
generous layer of cheddar cheese over
the top now I like cheddar but you can
use your favorite
cheese all right now I'm going to slip
it back into the
oven turn the oven up to broil and let
it bake for an additional 5 to 7 minutes
just until the cheese melts and turns
nicely
Brown after about 5 minutes the cheese
is browned and you're ready to
serve and there you have it our simple
easy and delicious leftover turkey
casserole a great idea for after

turkey casserole a great idea I hope you
