hello YouTubers today we're making
buttermilk in just a few easy steps if
you're like us we could buy a gallon of
milk and we just don't use it all before
expecting to go bad so we buy 2% organic
so what I do is I turn it into
buttermilk when it looks like it's going
to expire before we use
it all you need is a glass jar with a
lid doesn't matter if it's plastic or
metal
add 1 and 3/4 cups of your 2% milk or
whole milk whatever you have
available you'll heat it to
70° but no more than
85° add 1 to 2 oz of your cultured
butter milk and stir it up then you'll
place the lid on the jar very
Loosely and leave it set out on the
counter for 24 to 48 hours depending on
how thick you like your buttermilk
what I do is about every 12 hours I
place the lid on tightly and shake the
jar and then loosen the lid back up hope
you enjoy this recipe it's a easy way to
make
