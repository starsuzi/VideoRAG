right let me start off by saying I know
I'm all over the place with my videos
you know one day might be a
automotive than you know maybe small
engine or hous work or whatever so I
just wanted to point out some stuff that
you know when I look to YouTube or
whatever I'm stumped on something and I
you know want to look something up it's
always came through so that's uh I'm
just paying it forward so anything I run
into that I have you know a question on
or something that I want to go over
that's what my videoos about but uh
speaking of being stumped uh this is
going to be about stump removal uh you
know again I'm all over the place but
anyways here we
go hey John here again I was just doing
some yard work and uh uh nobody likes to
see yard work but I thought of an
interesting video that uh uh stump
removal um as I'm going around the yard
just trimming some uh trees there this
goddamn
stump this has been a nuisance for quite
a bit now few Octobers ago this uh tree
fell I think it was an oak like that or
maybe a white oak or something but uh so
every once in a while this uh on my
trailers and you know just certain stuff
the landing gear will catch this it's
just a nuisance and it'll bend that
landing gear and uh so I'm going to get
it out of here but I've taken a bunch of
stumps out like this uh in the past I
like Evergreens they're pretty shallow
rooted so I'll just hook up a a chain to
the truck there and yank that out but
you ain't yanking this thing out with a
truck or you need a pretty heavy piece
of equipment to yank this out so I just
wanted to show you what I'm going to do
here to get this stump out it's pretty
big size um already you know past few
years I you know I see a just just a lot
of damage from hitting that thing maybe
plow a couple of times and I got to get
it out of there so what I do is uh I dig
around expose The Roots a little bit and
then uh just take a saws off
we just kind of bit here pruning pruning
uh
blade and uh just go around and cut the
roots and uh find a way to get a chain
snuck under one of those roots and look
through the truck and yank it out so
I've done this probably a dozen times or
so so it's an alternative way to do it
rather than renting a machine holy [ __ ]
look at that size of that
thing that thing just came out of the
earth wow
oh look at this
guy hey buddy that is one gnarly looking
grub wow look at that
bastard I don't think I've seen a grub
that big that's the granddaddy of all
daddies holy
[ __ ] look at a size of that
Peckerhead anyways uh so I'm going to go
cut uh dig around this a little bit cut
around this uh with the sawsa get a
chain hooked up uh like I was saying uh
you can rent a I don't know a stump
grinder from Home Depot I've rented that
I've done that before but it's like 300
bucks for the day and it'll take
probably I don't know 20 minutes to get
through something like this 30 minutes
maybe so you know if you got a bunch of
stumps maybe but this is an alternative
way it doesn't really cost you nothing
if you have a digging tool and a saws
all and of course a truck to pull it
with but
uh so anyways let me get set up I I'll
uh show you how I do this or you can get
a company in here and do it and who
knows how much that is two 300 bucks for
them to take a stump out easily so let
me show you this right
quick I'll probably just fast forward
through this but Howry I just dig around
it just dig around the
roots yeah you don't have to get really
techical but just to expose
them suppose any sh would work but this
digging to it makes the easy work out of
it threw that grub in it wood that thing
was a
monster that should be good
enough least everything's exposed
here getting rid of most of the dirt
helps too because that dirt adds a lot
of weight to the stump when you're
pulling it out of there
there I think I should do
it get a sawo in
there all let me get uh let me get a
lead cord set
up all right
well got a uh lead cord set up and all
I'll take is uh like I said this bit or
blade here longer the better but you
don't want to be get too long where it's
going to bend but I just go around and
cut all the roots just go into the
[Applause]
dirt you'll know when you're
through make sure there's no electric
around
it be electric around here
but I don't know if that's showing on on
the camera there but I just go ahead and
cut around to all the roots first then
uh see if I could snake a chain you know
I'll dig a little bit through here get
get hooked on like a root there see if
we can yank it with most of them
cut
that's pretty big one
there get a rock or
[Applause]
not
like I said I'll just keep going around
it make sure everything's cut see if
it'll lift out of there well we got a
chain hooked to the one route there
let's see if uh see if that sucker will
move
anywhere
try not even a little bit it's fine but
now I got uh a lot of tension on there
so I'll continue cutting with my saw at
least I'll know when things start moving
that uh in the right track
here look I found more of these giant
grubs bastards look at how big they are
holy [ __ ] they're uh living in a tree
here or dead part of the tree look at
they roll in this
uh I don't think I've ever seen grubs
that goddamn gnarly looking big there's
a lot of them in here too they come
piling out
but two or three of them in
there play dead but they're alive it's
alive look at that thing hideous another
one I think I got him with a
saw anyways I'm going to keep working
around this street and see if I can get
this thing to budge I cut out a couple
of links here but uh this one's proving
to be pretty
gnarly
well I uh did a few more cuts and I just
got in a truck to see if there was any
tension as soon as I put it in the gear
I see it I stepped on a gas and it broke
free but I didn't catch that on video
but but you can see these deep
rooted uh you know tap Roots there uh
it's not really what I was concerned
with I just basically cut around you
know all the stuff I can with uh with
the saw which as you can see there it
reach down I mean you can't see what
you're doing you just go and it'll cut
and it'll start getting easy because
it's just in the dirt but I did waste
two blades because uh let me see see how
it doesn't have a you know all the sharp
teeth are gone because I kept hitting
these little bastard rocks in there
which you can't see but you know and I
probably had a few other nice little
rocks but man those uh those grubs were
we all over the place I'm sure they're
full infested in this stump but look at
them they're all over the place but uh
so anyway there you have it um this
thing is pretty heavy fraking stump as
far as stumps
go
um but like I said my first cut was here
so I can get this chain wrapped around
something and I'm surprised actually
that little nub held up but it did cuz
this Bas is pretty heavy with that dirt
so I'm going to try to shake a lot of
that dirt off and I'll drag that back in
the back and Bada Boom Bada Bang there
you have it
one chain one saws off one truck one
stump gone pretty simple to do just uh
get more than one blade I would say uh
the pruning blades I think came in that
uh package here I think there was five
or six of them at one point
um I don't know oh yeah five five
uh five uh whatever TPI is teeth per
inch know that must be I don't know how
much many blades would came in here but
whatever it was it was at least two and
uh did the job probably less than 10
bucks for that set of blades so uh
that's all I got for now goodbye stump
pain in the
ass there you have it now you see it now
you
don't just flatten it out with my
Steamroller and
uh no more
goddamn catching that stupid landing
gear on there or even when it hits the
tire any trailer back in here it's
always been a problem so let me get back
to my yard
work well there you have it except for
the cost of the blades uh maybe 10 bucks
if you have a saww and a Truck and a
chain uh you might save yourself few
bucks uh it's simple to do it took me
about an hour maybe an hour and a half
after uh clean up and everything uh so
it's no big deal and that stump was
probably about 17 in 18 in around uh you
know bigger than that you might have a
problem but anything less than that no
problem at all so there you have it
later
