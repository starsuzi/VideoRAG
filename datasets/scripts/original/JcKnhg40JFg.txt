hello and welcome to Garden
focused today I'm going to show you how
to prune a gbury
bush now with gbury bushes it's
relatively simple as long as you bear in
mind three golden
rules the first is to prun out any old
wood
the older the wood on a gbury bush the
less productive it will
be so once it once it gets to be about 4
5 years old that wood will stop
producing
gbes so that's the first
rule the second rule is to prune out any
branches which are crossing in other
words they're touching each other as
they cross because that will wear out
the branches and give you the
possibility of introducing
diseases to the
plant at the same time we want to get
rid of any branches which are low down
on the ground because those are the
branches like this one here that will
pick up Splash from the soil when it
rains in the summer and you will get
fungal
diseases and the third and final rule is
to keep the center of the gbury Bush
relatively
open this will also prevent fungal
diseases in the summer because it will
allow the the air and the wind to
circulate throughout the bush and stop
it accumulating any dead areas that
fungi can get hold of and
damage so we'll just focus the camera in
a bit more and I'll prune out a few of
the uh older wood I'll also prune out a
few of the branches that are really
touching the
ground and I'll keep the center
relatively
clear now the only equipment you'll need
for this is a pair of reasonably sharp
secur so first we're looking for old
wood
here and here's a branch here but it
just looks a bit more worn out
niled and has less bugs on than the
other ones so we'll prune it right down
as low as we Poss possibly
can you have to be careful with some of
these gbury bushes cuz they have vicious
Thorns this particular one is hinaki red
and although it does produce delicious
gbes it does have a lot of
THS okay here's another one here coming
off that one
[Applause]
so we'll prune that out as well so we'll
do that for all the old wood that we can
see and the next thing is to look for
branches or Twigs that are pointing
downwards or are crossing so here we've
got a very low Branch here that's
actually touching the ground so we'll
prune that one out
and put that to one
side I don't know what that is but we'll
get that out of the way so we'll go
around the whole Bush looking for
crossing
branches and here's another one here
here's a Crossing Branch here we Pro
that
out so we'll go around and do that all
over the plant
now finally uh you're looking to keep
the center of the Bush clear of too many
branches excuse me you're trying to make
it like a goblet shape so it comes up
like
that uh actually this one's quite good
because we pruned it this way in
previous years but there are one or two
branches there that we'll get rid of so
there's one in the right in the middle
there and we'll prune that
now the best time to prune your gbury
bush is anytime from November to the end
of
January basically when the bush is
dormant probably the worst thing you can
do with a gbury bush is not prun it
enough and it's very unlikely that
you'll over prune it so that's a simple
way of how to prune a gbury bush
