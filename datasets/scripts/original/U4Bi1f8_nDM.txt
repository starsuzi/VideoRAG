so this is how to burn and seal the
edges of organza of any synthetic fabric
so first you need a cat
I like to use a t9
okay what the whole idea of this thing
is so to seal the sides so that it
doesn't free okay so it's really right
simple just be careful when you first
start off start off with a street called
straight straight fabric side and just
gently go and run it towards you notice
helped the fire will sort of burn the
fabric and the fabric will retract so
essentially I like to just put it
against the base of a tea light and run
it through
and just don't worry if the edges are
straight or you have like a loop
because well we are for this thing we
are going to make flame so
irregular edges is fine as long as you
know and try it touching it pulling it
this way it will not free okay the whole
idea is to play for free and then
destroying the costume after its name so
basically just run a true relic so if if
your fabric catches fire it is quickly
blowing up but usually that doesn't
now the tricky part comes when you hit
the edge you can't exactly hold the edge
so you got to hold it at a corner and
then just gently go towards the flame
and then when a brick is melted goodbye
so go towards the flame and back go pull
back
this one I can run clicking
okay now sharp line same thing just gold
near the flame and then when you see
that it's melting kuba
don't over burn the fabric because then
it just gets smaller and smaller we'll
be doing it they do need to get a nice
good see you so it won't free just
granny tree
you soon
comes with practice
you might get some you might smell this
burning plastic smell that is what you
get when you melt this synthetic fabric
is basically plastic okay and here we
have it okay
a strip
for the ages but
in a shop corner
