hey everybody welcome back to the wolf
pit today I'm making black eyed peas
with smoked ham hocks this is a southern
classic dish and definitely one of my
personal favorites and they're easy to
make so let's get started
in a large pan I'm adding my smoked ham
hocks and cold water you can also use
smoked ham smoked pork neck bones smoked
turkey wings legs or necks Etc you get
the point use the smoked meat you like
the best
ham hocks take a long time to cook down
and become tender so I'm going to bring
this up to a boil reduce the heat to
medium Low cover and let them simmer for
about an hour and a half just until they
start to become tender
after simming for an hour and a half
with the lid on they're just now
beginning to break down
I had one large chopped up yellow onion
one pound of dried Black Eyed Peas that
have been rinsed and drained
granulated onion
granulated garlic
bay leaves
and black pepper I'm not adding any salt
yet due to the salt of the ham hocks and
in my opinion if you add salt too early
to dry peas or beans it makes them tough
I'll adjust for salt and other
seasonings once the peas are done

give everything a good mix bring it up
to a boil reduce the heat to medium Low
cover and let them simmer for about an
hour and a half to two hours until the
pork falls apart and the peas are tender
after simmering for an hour and a half
you can see the Black Eyed Peas have
doubled in size and soaked up most of
the broth
but they're still a little firm and the
pork is getting tender but not quite
fall apart tender yet so give it a stir
cover and let them simmer for another 30
minutes or so
finally after simmering for a total of
two hours the pork has fallen apart the
Black Eyed Peas are tender and the broth
is thickened up nicely
and there you have it southern style
black eyed peas with smoked ham hocks
they're Smoky Rich tender and silky
smooth absolutely delicious I could eat
