YouTubers hey YouTubers this is old John
doing another DIY project do it
yourself um it's kind of windy out here
so bear with the noise if there is any
going to do some edging today and I got
my edging from uh Big
Lots normally $6 for 25 ft roll it's
about 4 in is tall and I got it for like
$4 cuz it's at the end of the season so
it's a good time to get some
deals it's like I said this is 25 ft
long and it has a piece on the end which
is right here and this slides into the
end of the tubing to connect to the next
tubing and first thing you do you want
to lay it
out and in my case I'm laying it out on
my
driveway sun's so bright out here I
don't know if you can see it but this
will
help flatten it
out so that's first step so let's go
uh try laying
it okay so it's kind of windy out here
here so you may have bit of trouble
hearing me I'll try to speak up here's
the finished
stretch that I've already installed uh
this is going along a along a
landscaping bed that's
raised and it's already got PE gravel on
it I've done about half of it and so I'm
now I'm going to come around this side
so this this has not been laid yet first
thing you want to first thing you want
to do is is brush all the P Gra
travel away so you have room to work and
then you're going to be digging a trench
basically to take the take the edging
some of the tools you
need something you can put your knees
on um various various tools you can use
nice edging shovel this is not perfectly
flat but it's close you can actually get
an edging tool that's perfectly flat you
can just dig down into the soil my soil
is pretty loose so I don't really need
to use it very often but anyway I've got
it out here I'm uh able just to use a
nice nice little TR Garden TR I have a
little tile cutting device knife also
that I can scrape in the
soil actually make me a trench and then
dig it out with the TR need some garden
gloves
possibly a
um xacto blade to cut
the bands off of
the edging material and and possibly cut
the end when you finish might need a
wheelbarrow to put your dirt in I'm
actually just taking the dirt and then
just scooping it down where I've already
installed it or
down the other way where I'm going to
put it in and then just work it back
down in so once you get all the dirt in
then you cover it up with PE gravel and
then it has a nice Edge to it um so the
first thing I'm going to do is connect
the new piece here with the old piece
that's already installed there's a 4in
tube that came with it I showed that to
you it slides into the ends of the old
the RN and the new piece and then you
basically just slide them together like
so and then you're ready to start laying
the new piece and you basically
just put it down the
soil that in the hole you've already
created and then how the
dirt and gravel around
it like
so
if you look at the end of the piece it's
got
two edges on one side and one on the
other side this is to hold it in place
the dirt and the gravel will go down top
of that so um the
two pieces should go on the side away
from the grass and in this case towards
my
Landscaping
okay you can see that I've dug
out quite a bit
here so now we
just place
the edging down in the trench I've
dug like
so
and we're ready
to fill
it the loose
dirt and PE
[Music]
gravel okay there's the finished Edge
and here's the here's the
dirt packed it packed down you can
just walk it in with your
foot like
so some on the outside
too if you've overd dug a little bit
just pack it
in
go ahead
and pull the PE gravel down onto
it giving it a nice finished
Edge that's all there is to
it well I decided to uh finish this
video up I was so inspired by how easy
this was going in and I went ahead and
finished it I ended up with about 104 ft
approximately $20 worth of
materials
here's where I went below the drain
which you see on the other side I had to
cut but here the edging is low enough
that I'm just going to leave it like
that the water can flow over
it but here here is the finished
product going around this very
large Landscaping bed
and the critical thing is when you're
digging your trench make the vertical
side away from the grass make sure
that's as vertical as possible because
that's where it's going to stand
up and the other side doesn't have to be
vertical cuz you're going to fill it in
with dirt or Rock so there again you can
use a string line or paint a line
if you don't already have a line
established like I did
so4
ft of edging
so here's the finished product of my
edging project about 104
ft of edging going around a raised
landscap
Landscaping bed with p r on
it
