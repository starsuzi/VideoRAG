hello everyone today I made candles I'm
making needs for my mom for Mother's Day
and I'm also giving them out to my aunts
candles are so expensive so I decided to
make them on my own and the internet
showed so many cute ways to make it with
like ribbons and tags and all these
doilies the cost to make these are
surprisingly really cheap here and
here's a quick shot of everything I'm
going to use start off with preparing
your jars just open the lid and remove
the other lid underneath
it put in your
Wick now we're going to use chopsticks
to hold up the wicks in a straight way
so we're going to take like the ends of
the Chopsticks
together and just slide your Wick in
between and tape the other end of your
chopsticks now we're going to do that
for the rest of our jars this recipe
makes six candles for one pint jars I
have 4 lbs of wax but I'm going to use
only one pound at a time to melt and I'm
going to chop these up in tiny pieces so
they'll melt better in the
pot
in a double boiler add one pound of wax
and let that
melt try to melt this on low
heat once it's melted add in your food
coloring I don't really recommend using
food coloring but this is what I had I'm
sure they have specifically made
coloring for candles that's a lot easier
to use now I just stir very
gently I'm adding in my fragrance oil
and I'm going to keep
stirring this looks really red right now
but it doesn't reflect the true
color dab some of it on a piece of paper
towel just the
color once you're done pour it into jars
it's starting to get pink over here to
wash everything dip it in hot
water I mix mine Nu in a few different
colors this didn't show like the true
true color yet you had to wait 24 hours
before you could see the color it's
going to really come out
of I think my jars like progressively
change colors throughout the day I would
like to note that one pound of wax fills
up around one and a half of a
jar but even if you don't fill a whole
jar right away you could just continue
on melting more wax and just pouring it
over the wax that's already been filled
in a jar I'm just cutting the Wix now
and removing the chopsticks you want to
leave at least half an inch to around an
inch so this will burn
[Music]
properly now I'm going to show you how I
decorated my jars I use ribbons and gift
tags and
whatnot I think I bought these all from
Michaels everything like everything here
you see the ribbons the tags the blacks
everything from
Michaels it's up to you really if you
want to go through the eff of decorating
these jars but I felt like this is
probably the most fun part of this whole
candle making
process now take one of your jars and
take the caps and place them on top of
your jars and push it
shut I'm going to take one of my circle
tabs or tags you could use the any kind
of scrapbooking paper you want instead
and cut out a circle that sound just
easier and you put the
other circle thing what do you call
it just place the other half of your lid
and screw it
on the ribbon on my tag helps hold it
new
place I'm not going to go bother with
gluing or taping cuz that seems like a
little bit more effort there's a ribbon
here but I'm just going to swish it to
the side push it underneath the lid and
pretend it's not
there it's not much of a hindrance as it
looks it looks like it is right
[Music]
now I'm adding a ribbon to the of my
jar I'm going to tie it as if I'm tying
a shoelace but I'm going to stick a gift
tag in between since why not since I
want it on there I as well do it at the
same
[Music]
time
[Music]
this is a paper doy I got from Dice of
Japan I'm just going to stick it on top
of the jar and place the lid onp top of
it and screw it
[Music]
on and that's how it looks with it
screwed
on
yep I'm going to try to be fancy and I'm
going to try to do a layering effect
sort of with my ribbons I'm going to
first add a really big ribbon around my
jar and after this I'm going to put a
skinnier ribbon on top of it so first
just wrap the ribbon
around your jar and you secure it with
some
tape this is nursing tape it's all I had
at
home which are pretty useful and pretty
ter terrible ter terrible sounds like
I'm saying terrible Terrible's not a
word isn't
it this tape easily tears yay now I'm
adding another tape and making it sort
of doublesided
but I'm placing it on top of the other
tape cuz ribbon on ribbon doesn't stick
very well and I'm just cutting off the
end and connecting them but I'm going to
make sure this is a little bit more
straight before I connect
it so I'm cing it again
this is homemade and all but I still
think you should try to make things a
little
perfect and
[Music]
neat now take your other ribbon the
skinnier one wrap it around the bigger
ribbon and it into a
bow I just wanted to mention that you
don't have to make everything pink like
I'm doing just play around with the
colors you can make your candles
different colors you can leave them
white which may be easier and cheaper
and your ribbons you could do it with
any color any fabric whatever you like
just be creative and have
fun
again I'm adding the cover onto my
jar trying to decide on which tag I want
to use which one goes together the most
I'm just going to go with this one and
with this one I'm going to place the
bigger
tag underneath this circle
one and and I'm putting the lid on
trying to switch my fingers around so I
could hold on to it now I'm going to
screw it
on and yay looks like
[Music]
this I think this one was a simpler look
out of my other jars but I think simple
was pretty cute
too it was a white
jar and I added pink and gray tags to
it and doing the same
thing to secure my tags on using the lid
to hold it down and screwing it
on and I just simply tied it with this
ribbon I'm not sure if it's called a
ribbon more like a
[Music]
string
[Music]
now I'm going to eventually tie a ribbon
I suppose oh now now I'm tying a
ribbon and I'm going to probably untie
my ribbon and make it into a bigger
ribbon cuz the small ribbon wasn't good
enough for
me
[Music]
try to make your Ribbon a little more
cute and give it to some character cut
off the
string and here's your
jar I'm going to try to move the ribbon
somewhat towards the midle where the tag
is
look I think my last jar was just my
whatever jar cuz this is whatever I had
left like this is the only two tags I
had and they were like the gray ones and
it was with my white
jar I did eventually try to add a splash
of Pink by adding a ribbon
at the neck of the
jar and here's some wax I'm trying to
get off my
jar just scw the cap on and that's how
it
looks why sorry about the poor
lighting I don't know what to
do and here it's me tying the
[Music]
ribbon again I'm placing it around where
my tag
is you could either use the ribbon to
hold up the tag or you could use the lid
of the jar to hold up the tag I just did
whatever Flo my
boat at the moment now cut off the
ribon
[Music]
[Music]
and here are the
[Music]
results I can't say these were like
extremely easy but they weren't like
overly difficult either with a little
little bit of effort these can turn out
really
great I really really love how these
turned out if I saw these in the store I
would so so buy it I'm making these for
Mother's Days but I think this could be
a good gift for like any occasion
