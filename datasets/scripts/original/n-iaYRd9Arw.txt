today I'm making apple crumble we're
going to start by peeling and cutting
the apples and then placing them in some
water to stop them from browning
cut the apples in half and then half
again making sure you cut out all of the
core and then cut each quarter into
three smaller pieces but feel free to
leave yours bigger

we're now going to let the Apple simmer
for about five to ten minutes
so pop them in the pan with some castor
sugar water and a bit of cinnamon
for the crumble we're going to add flour
butter caster sugar
oh and a bit of cinnamon and rub it
together until fine bread crumbs if like
me you like some chunks in your crumble
squeeze together your flour mixture
until your desired texture so my apples
have been simmering to full 7 minutes so
pour them into your baking tray and pour
over your handle
I'm adding some cinnamon into my crumble
mixture to give it that little extra
flavor make sure to spread your crumble
evenly

pre-heat your oven to 160 degrees fan
but other temperatures they'll be listed
here pop it in the oven for 20 to 30
minutes or until lightly golden on top
and you can see some apples bubbling up
the side so that's apple crumble easy
and very delicious make sure you watch
next week as I'll be showing you how to
make custard which will go perfectly
with your apple crumble
