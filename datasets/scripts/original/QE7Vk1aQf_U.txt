Today on Sugar Spun Run, I'll be showing you how to make my all-time
favorite macaroni salad recipe. Macaroni salad is one of my favorite summer side dishes.
It is so light and colorful, and it is so simple to make. The first thing you'll need to start with is 8 ounces of
macaroni noodles. Cook these according to your package instructions, and then immediately rinse them in cold water, and drizzle them with a
teaspoon of olive oil and stir them up really well so that they don't stick together while you're preparing your other ingredients.
Next you'll need a 1/2 cup of finely chopped sweet pickles. For me, this is usually about 4 to 6 of the small sweet gherkins.
Chop them up and add them to a large bowl with your macaroni noodles, and then add 1/2 of a diced red pepper.
1 finely chopped celery stick.
And a third cup of finely diced red onion. Finally, I like to dice and add two hard-boiled eggs
At this point you can also add cheese if you'd like, but I usually just stick with these basic ingredients
I've just shown you, and now let's make our dressing. For my macaroni salad dressing, I always start with 3/4 cups of mayonnaise.
I like to use olive oil Mayo but regular is just fine. Next, I'll add a quarter cup of sour cream and
2 tablespoons of sweet pickle juice. 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar. 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 2 teaspoons of dijon mustard.
Now for the spices.
I like to add 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper, 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder
and then I also like to add just a dash of crushed red pepper for a little extra heat.
Now we will whisk these ingredients together really well.
Then we'll pour the dressing over the rest of the macaroni salad ingredients.
Now use a large spoon or a spatula to stir everything together really well
And that is all there is to making my all-time
favorite macaroni salad recipe. As you guys just saw, this is so simple to make.
Now you can serve this macaroni salad right away
once you've finished mixing everything together,
but I do like to chill mine in the fridge for about an hour or so,
because it gets all of the ingredients of the same temperature nice and chilled and it helps the flavors to really develop.
I really hope you guys will try this out and let me know what you think.
I hope you love it as much as I do. Thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you next time
