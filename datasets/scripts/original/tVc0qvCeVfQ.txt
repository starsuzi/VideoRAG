hello everyone its owner from honest
paper gracious and there are some of you
who would like a tutorial on how to make
this a paper sailboat here that I showed
in the previous video I showed how to
make care they said if photo cube box so
for this I'm using a precious memory so
6x6 paper and I'm will use the blue
paper again so then we can start on the
bottom of the sailboat so then we start
with by a drawing in angle so you can
use your ruler here if you like to solve
out a bit more here maybe so and it
doesn't have to be perfect at all so you
can cut this out
so then we flip it over because I'm not
sure the angle is the same on both sides
just drop around then cut it off and I
go a bit on the outside here and also on
this side here so then we need to fold
this in so we have some inches and I
like to use a bit of wet clothes so I'm
sure it won't stare so then I fold in
the line we'll try to follow the drawing
line
so but we can take some of this away on
the top and we can groove it together
here have some scotch a quick dry glue
in this a fine tip a bottle so if you
don't use it before it's really a great
bottle you get a small amount of glue
out so I will link to a cellar below so
that we can dilute this other part on
top here so try to line it up so you cut
off the rest of the hinges
so here you can use some hinges inside
if you like to or you can just use your
hot glue gun to glue it down with so
just shake the bits like so so I will
just use my hot glue gun here so then I
just fill it up inside try to hold it in
place
shape the bit more so so then I just
start filling it up a lot of Golu here
and we need this to dry for a moment so
now it's and right so then we can cut it
out I just try to follow the bottom line
here
maybe waited a bit longer
so about and then we need a apart in the
middle here as well so we can try to use
this shape so here you just eyeball a
bit so I'm going a bit here just right
to round it a bit so I'm sure this won't
do fits but then we just cut off a bit
more
I'm in Chicago for beat only answer
yeah I think that is fine bit more on
the top here maybe
so then we need to make the sale so this
I cut out about to I bit over three so
here I will up with the side of it
no three sides so it's more easy to roll
it so start from this idea so you have
just a small pin that I will roll it
around so it could be a thinner also
like I need to rest a bit more
just to work with it a bit
here about buffing and we can take some
good look inside here and gold away
together
slowboat and then we can draw the shape
so just eyeball it here here about maybe
and open top here roll it a bit more
tight here try to look this o'toole
below and go in an angle down here so
hopefully this is right now so then I
will cut into up here
still the paper is wet I should have
waited a bit get all the way up to the
line here and about a half inch from
here and then a bit in here and go in
and I go up so straight here so and then
we can wet this up a bit so we're
rolling this also see I am working in
between the tripod here so lift it up a
bit so try to throw it a bit more tight
go inside here
and we can make the other side and this
I got the one inch I think yeah
so we'll see how far we wanted to go
down I think I will roll it first so
then we can roll it from this side just
a tiny bit so we can go it down
so bugs so then I will take glue here
but only from here and up
Pisa
so can we just hold this back again
so then we can cut it in an angle down I
think it's better whether mattresses
there here so so about a little bit in
an angle up here now we can cut the rest
of here
so also on top here
so now the sale is so finished so now we
can see how it fits inside here how high
we want it to be here about I think so
then I cut it off here so now it's 2 and
3/4 high so then we can see where we
want it just stay here
you're about so
take your mark on this one and make a
hole for it and here I have a
crop-a-dile
so it's easy to use we can glue this
inside and again I will use my hot glue
gun and fill it up here I can eat some
more Golu here I'm using a hot or a low
temperature here so please be careful it
will be very hot this so just fill it up
with ghulam this also helps it makes
it's a bit study
so
maybe filled it up bit more
I'm gonna need to hold it a bit but I
can pull this inside here so this was a
bit too large to land we just cut off
with the bit
we need to hold it too until it set
right up so no it said right and I have
a completely forgot if you want some
rope around here it's best to do that
before you have a glue the sail into the
boat we'll try to just poke a hole here
take some rope inside here
I'm not here
we need the goof your boat
get off
so see if we can manage to place this
inside the sample to Kalugin here
so and one on the other side as well I
will just take them go on top here twist
this around some couple of times three
times maybe
so
I'm here as well
 them
so I try to go with this inside here
so
and then we can have something on the
top taking a bit tighter maybe I think
it will work so here you can take a bird
on top or you can take a butterfly and
see what I have here some tiny
butterflies from paper line but you can
glue on top where you can take a bird
and this is cut out from this die here
from impression obsession so I think I
want this on top here just use my hot
glue gun here again
so so this was the sailboat so I hope it
was helpful and if you have any
questions please look in the description
box below there you will find some
information how I answer questions and
you will also find the link to my blog
for close-up pictures so they maybe show
you you can put something inside here if
you like to a little boy or sir having
for a sailing so yeah it's a lot of fun
you can do with this so take care
everyone and have fun creating bye bye
