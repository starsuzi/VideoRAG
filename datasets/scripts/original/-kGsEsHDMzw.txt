the sensory capacity that spiders have
come to develop in their extremities is
extraordinary and
surprising in fact certain species of
spiders seem to rely exclusively on this
super sense in order to
survive the trapdoor spider of the genus
stopus constructs a Subterranean tube
like so many other spiders but it covers
it perfectly with a trapo that hides its
layer
once finished no one would suspect that
someone lies in weight
underground but how does the spider know
when prey passes by or when it is a
predator only by the Tremor of its
steps no human seismograph would move
even a millimeter for the micro
earthquake produced by the steps of a
cricket the trapdoor spiders probe the
surroundings of their hidden Lair by
means of
touch they keep their front feet and
contact with the silk that makes up the
door of their
Hideout and thanks to this sense of
touch the finest designed in all of
nature they await the appearance of
Prowlers who might be
caught the most remarkable thing is that
the spider even knows how to assess when
its prey is exactly at attack distance
a few millimeters further away it doubts
but it does not
decide only when the micr Tremors tell
it that the prey is in the correct
direction and at the indicated point
does the spider
emerge then all it has to do is
