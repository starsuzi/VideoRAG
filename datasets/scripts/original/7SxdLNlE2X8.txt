hello everybody this is tsha from pretty
lasers.com and today I have a review and
a update on some things um we also we
got some prettyl los.com water bottles
and those will be on the website soon
for giveaways and also to
purchase um everybody loves water
bottles me I have
but these are actually really cute and
we also may be doing some tank tops we
have a few out there um Nana like sort
out in hers and everybody's asking about
them so um possibly we will be doing
those today for review I brought to you
a little slice of Texas that's where I'm
from and these are a Texas treat these
are my favorite things to snack on other
than um don't mind the boxes um other
than cucumbers and pickles so if you
love pickles you'll
love pickle okra the brand that I like
is a taco Texas crisp okra pickles and
basically it's just an okra put in
vinegar and some
spices um the stats on these I'll insert
a picture of it's two
pieces
for five
calories and there's about 12 servings
of these in here um I put them in the
fridge and get them really cold and then
um just kind of I'm weird I like to suck
the um the juice out of it and then take
forever eating it um they're not slimy
so if you're afraid to eat them because
of you don't like okra and you think
it's going to be slimy these are not
slimy at all um it's my also favorite
other treat is freeze dried okra and
um it's just a great alternative
to pickles I guess but better I I like
these better more better I like them
more
better um this brand alone comes in
regular mild and hot I can't eat the hot
one because it's too spicy but the mild
is okay and they also taste great in
bloody mares and red
beers so um you can order them at talk o
texas.com I'll put the link in the
review and um tell them prettyl los.com
sent you but um definitely try them
they're they're great for parties
they're good for snacking
um I just I can't say enough great
things about them I give it two thumbs
up and if you're um if you're a pickle
lover you'll love pickled okra so
um once again
it's Taco
Texas and um I don't know if I said two
pieces is five calories and zero fat so
even if you did eat the whole
jar you're not going to do too terribly
bad but um you won't you won't eat the
whole jar one sitting so um I guarantee
you'll like this if you like pickles I
guarantee it but if you don't like the
spice I would try to get the regular
because it's still it's got a small kick
to it and um there's nothing
um there's you know there's nothing
really bad in here it's just okra water
vinegar salt natural spices and flavors
and calcium
chloride and um they have to do that I
think when they pickle it
so that's the review
