save yourselfa with Furniture F the
quick fix for old sagging sofas the
difference will Amaze you so here we are
again Happy Thanksgiving it's a
Thanksgiving Day edition of the product
tester and
today I have actually a a a fair amount
of Hope for this product it's the
Furniture
Fix actually I don't have a whole a
whole lot of Hope because if you look at
what the product is this a piece of
plastic but we'll see what happens but
if you can see here our our sagging
couch this couch has seen a lot of days
poor little guy and when I sit in there
put my fat ass down on
it it's it starts to Sag and it's pretty
it's pretty bad so we're gonna we're
going to try this Furniture Fix
thing
so worn out Springs put pressure on
Lower backs but Furniture Fix fixes all
your cushions for instance of we going
to do is I'm going to take these
cushions off here oh my goodness Hey
look it's one of your
darts oh Jesus this is horrible that's
pretty disgusting how do
that
um and you just uh looks like you
assemble
them
[Music]
pretty
simple they just kind of lock together
like
that that's what I'm assuming
because I guess it
doesn't all
right put on our next but that little
looks different now
right wa there's a big side and a little
side
[Music]
maybe go to the big
side and then then the little side goes
in a little side maybe that's
it all right so I got them all put
together it's just just like a big side
and a little side and you got to kind of
keep your eye on it and then you're
supposed to kind of spread them
apart the one problem I see is that the
packaging so it's kind of kind of sucky
in that okay here's one whole package it
only does half the couch hey this one's
upside down hold on let me fix this one
can only do half a
couch you know this is this is only a
love seat so you need like need like
five cases of these things to
uh to get what you need to get
accomplished if you're going to do a
whole
couch so yeah I don't know this doesn't
look like it's going to do anything
but we'll we'll
try so this is be a good thing does it
look any different than this side and
this side's upside
down is it looking
different well this cushion backwards
sorry to get my ass little the camera
sorry let's do that all right so let's
see I'll I'll sit on this side
very comfortable let sit on this
side and I I don't feel a difference I
feel a
difference oh yeah I do I syn down a
little bit more in this
one seems to be
cool
uhoh I didn't sound
good what
happened
oh it just
like
oops that guy alert got like stuck down
here they said you could like jump on
this thing yeah I don't think so I don't
think I'm going to break it but just
like that I think it's just going to I
don't think it does a
lot invited a 400lb sumo wrestler and a
600lb sumo wrestler to try Furniture Fix
and look the couch did not sag or sink
with 1,000 lb of sumo amazing all right
here comes the junk test here we
go it works I guess but I don't even
know what it
does because like it doesn't span the
whole thing so it's still just G
to see yeah I mean it gives a i can feel
a little bit when I'm in it when I'm in
the chair I can feel a little bit that
it's it's giving a little bit more
support
but yeah I don't
know Furniture Fix is so strong it can
hold the weight of one cinder block even
two cinder blocks amazing let try this
part see if I can make it break uh
oh that didn't sound good
and it's still
working so couple things I noticed this
picture before and after yeah no way
 pardon my language no way and
then it shows her here doing a bed well
if you look at the instructions that
sorry they're WR because already almost
thr them out three sets to do to do one
twins siiz bed at 15 $1 each that's $45
for for a bit I mean look that King six
sets 90 bucks I mean come on really
