hi I'm s and I'm going to show you how
to make a delicious Pavlova wreath with
vanilla cream and berries I started by
preheating the oven to 170° C or 150° if
you have a fan oven or gas Mark 3 to
start with I've got a nice big clean
Bowl here and I've already put in six
egg whites and I'm going to start
whisking these with an electric whisk
for about 4
minutes
I've got 300 gram of Casta sugar and I'm
just going to add this about a
tablespoon at a time and then carry on
whisking that then needs whisking for
another couple of minutes and you'll see
the texture start to change and it gets
a nice shine to it once the egg
incorporates all the
[Music]
sugar now that forms soft peaks that you
can see but it still needs to be a
little bit firmer so at this point we
add a teaspoon of corn
flour that'll also make it lovely and
chewy in the
middle and 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of white
wine
vinegar another whisk for a couple of
minutes
okay now over here I've got a piece of
baking paper and on this I've actually
drawn a 25 cm diameter circle and this
is going to be my guideline for the
Pavlova wreath using a large
spoon it works perfectly this if you
just do one
spoon on each part of the line all the
way around you'll have just the right
amount of
mixture it looks great just like this
doesn't it that should be our final
spoon and now I'm going to put this
straight into the oven but as soon as
I've put it in the oven I'm going to
turn the temperature down to 140° 120 if
you have a fan oven or gas Mark 1 and
then I'm going to cook it for an hour
and a half then switch the oven off and
leave the Pavo in there to cool
completely preferably
overnight so this is a Pavo that has
cooked and cooled completely now I'm
very heavy going to peel this off the
paper I'm going to use a pet knife just
to help
me okay and then I'm very very carefully
going to slide it over onto my plate
here and next is the chocolate sauce so
in here I've got 100 gram of dark
chocolate and I'm going to add 100
millit of double
cream
and 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter and
I've got a little borie going here so
I'm going to pop the gas on okay that's
melting down nicely but gently so I'm
going to add 100 gr of castor sugar and
5 tablespoons of golden
syrup give that another stir and then
I'm just going to leave that to melt
together for 5 minutes over a really low
heat meanwhile let's get on with the
vanilla cream I've got 300 milliliters
of double cream here and I'm going to
add three tablespoons of Casta sugar and
one teaspoon of vanilla
extract I'm going to whisk this together
with an electric whisk till it's nice
and thick and
creamy let's get the Pavo back
over and we're now going to pop this
gorgeous sweet vanilla cream just evenly
over the top of a pavalova
and then on top of this I've got a whole
selection of lovely winter red berries
you can really use any selection you
like and you're just going to pile them
on top
so I've got
raspberries put on as much as you can
pile on top to make it look really
special and
Christmasy and then I've got some blue
bris
here doesn't matter if some of them fall
down because you're going to present it
all on the
plate
blackberries some strawberries just just
dot those around like
this finally I've got some gorgeous
sweet juicy
cherries and again I've left the stalks
on
here looks like jewels on a Crown
doesn't it drizzle this
over the very final thing is just a
quick dusting of icing
sugar all the way
around so this is a really indulgent
dessert for any special occasion Pavlova
with vanilla cream chocolate sauce and
berries
