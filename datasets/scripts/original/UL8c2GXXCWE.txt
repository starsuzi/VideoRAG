okay Linda what you doing I am starting
supper tonight you're having liver and
onions roasted
vegetables and that's it maybe Co slly
if I get you to put the machine up but
I've got about 3 tablespoons of oil in
the frying pan
okay I'm going to
add Just a Touch just a touch of
margarine for flavor yes
okay um what is this thing that's a
butter nut
squash and if you say that you don't
like it I will laugh at you because
you've had it in the last six things
of roasted vegetables don't you know
it's not nice to laugh at your husband
quit
laughing
whoops all right I shouldn't uh say
anything while you're dealing with a
knife knowing how dangerous you are
usually I do this with videlia onions
but they looked horrible at the grocery
store so I'm just using white onions
that was a red onion I put into the
other vegetables well I think your
videlia
froze I don't know if you can see out
the window here
here but it's snowing like crazy now
what I
do I put the onions on turn it whoops
turn it on high for a couple of minutes
and then I turn it right down I put a
lid on it and let them sweat in there
until they're very very
soft note to any law enforcement agency
that is looking for a an interrogator
Linda knows how to sweat
them but there's the
onions and now I'm going to
add hopefully some black pepper probably
not little
bit more of Linda's famous
measuring and then a Sprinkle of white
pepper what no red pepper I haven't come
to it yet oh
okay digging it out from that big
storage
shelf show me your red pepper there's
your red peppers okay and you cannot
grind these in the grinder why not
they're too wet it's hard to clean the
thing
afterwards okay don't lick your hands
though that might be
painful don't rub your eyes either
and when you're dealing with onions you
start
crying they don't usually bother you
though but there's the onions
in oh I forgot to add some
salt oh you forgetting salt my God and
today I'm using smoked
salt did you hear about the latest trick
came up
with if you really like your coffee you
smoke it
Hest you got to be kidding no that's the
new way of uh getting high I guess or
something that's your caffeine fix for
the whatever length of time you live
okay yeah that's my onions
in see Don wanted supper because I
called up while he was working and I
says hey I finally did it I got all the
dishes
done so of course I had to come down and
interrupt hey I've been working hard
today
dear I know you're studing up
everything I'm putting the new business
onto my photo
computer and uh it's hard to see
I keep taking glasses
off changing them around that's just
some
oil oh that's for the roasted
vegetables try some steak spice on it
this
time why are you adding it to the oil
instead of onto the vegetables
does it make any difference I hope not I
did it by
mistake okay first you put the
vegetables on you want some spicy
paprika yeah but put the vegetables on
[Music]
first eating at Linda's house is always
an
adventure you never know what you're
going to get
[Music]
okay you're trying to redeem
yourself no I'm trying to cook a to CH
to change a mistake into a huge success
that's what cooking is chefs do it
perfectly the first
time cooks and
Housewives if you can fix a mistake
you're much better than a chef
okay
dear I'll let that one
slide at least you aren't a
[Music]
doctor
oh see you turn it down but they've
already started to get off and no none
of them are
burnt the camera's going to jiggle cuz
I'm laughing
today come on I'm in a fantastic mood I
just got good news about that doctor's
appointment yes so you can't you finally
got a
doctor well let's clarify that you got a
referral to a doctor that's not going on
vacation
I'm going to see
uh he tests your nerves to find out
which ones are good and which ones are
bad and how to fix them if if they can
be
fixed
so I go the end May
[Music]
22nd too much
information well good God look at the
snow come down
no they keep hearing me say different
things about me and my health so I
thought I would tell them what the
doctor was okay cuz I don't know what
he's called oh time to wash your hands
time to wash my hands we'll bring you
back in the boat pet one of the cats
first you're
nasty we'll bring you back in about 20
minutes when I start the liver okay talk
to you later bye-bye there we go
okay now time for the liver the
vegetables are cooked in the oven I'm
just letting them letting the moisture
evaporate these are the onions they've
all sweated
down now for the
liver you need about 2 or 3 tablespoons
of oil in the pan that might be
two that might be four no two or
three lucky I am not stepping on your
toe so don't holler at me or on your
tail I'm adding hot paprika or spicy
paprika
and I'll use seasoned salt this time you
can change the spices around to whatever
way you
like and I know people are going to say
liver ew
but I just found out I've got low
B12 and there's no B12 found in plant
Foods so you're supposed to eat lots of
liver is good clams clams
oysters any type of meat really but
liver is one of the best but red meat is
better than
chicken so I thought I would show you
how I I say about
oysters doesn't work trust
me I'm going to add in some red peppers
too but salt and pepper
fine when I was pregnant for my first
son the doctor said eat lots of liver
and Don heard them so don would go to
the store and he'd buy liver
and he'd say now you make sure you cook
that and he'd come home after his night
shift cuz and he'd say did you cook that
liver and I'd say Yes
dear never asked me if I ate
it
okay but there you just let the pan get
hot now this is what I do different from
almost anybody else I don't dredge it in
flour I don't add anything to it I take
it out of the pan or out of the
package yeah it's not quite hot enough
yet and liver comes in all sorts of
weird shapes and textures
and I think it depends on the mood of
the butcher how he cuts
it but there's two pieces
and there's my third
piece and I let it cook until it gets
browned on the one side and then I clip
it and I add all the onions into it so
the meat picks up the onion
taste and it takes about 5 minutes to
cook a panful of Li
Okay the reason liver is so
popular that is $3 worth of
meat okay and is it going to set off the
smoke alarms no I don't do that with
liver I get out of the
way there now gray on the one side so I
turn it over
I didn't add salt to this because
the the onions have salt in them so this
doesn't need
it and there I turn it down
I make the elements
smaller and you really should wear an
apron cuz it's spitting at me so put an
apron on it's not spitting at
me
okay if I reach across and smack you on
the butt is that spal of you
yes it would be CU then I get the
Fri
oh a hot frying pan beats a cold hand
but there in about 2 minutes that'll all
be ready you can well my mother used to
add slice Green Tomatoes into it I think
she did the did that after she served
everybody except my dad cuz he was the
only one that liked it that
way but that is my liver
dinner that's your B12 dinner yeah um
Don's mother always dredged it in flour
and cooked it until it was very
use and my mother she'd cook it and it
was almost raw so I think I've hit the
happy medium I hope so I've got one son
that loves liver and I've got the other
son who hates it
oh well all right say goodbye we'll come
back when you're ready to serve okay oh
wait a minute you're hauling vegetables
out
yeah and those are the roasted or
steamed roasted vegetables there sweet
potatoes red onions carrots and
squash I added the red onions to give it
a little bit different color than
orange but that actually looks kind of
nice stuff in it but that's where my par
Snips they went too Woody I had to throw
a whole package out I was not impressed
okay but so that's how I make liver
dinner and I'll show it to you I'll let
Don show you when I get it all plated up
okay then see you in a bit bye-bye bye
okay this is
dinner um I forgot to fry the bacon and
add that but
M fried bacon shame on you
dear but yeah we I usually fry up some
bacon then cook the liver in with the
bacon but this is just as good there's
hardly any carbs and there's lots of
B12 talk to you later bye-bye
