hey what's going on everybody this is
Justin wolf from Wolf
Customs so in the past month I've been
really testing out this tarp behind me
my tarp that I got from uh Native
designs Tom humph and W
humph anyway I've treated this thing
with a couple things to see if it's
going to waterproof it I have no idea if
it actually successfully did it or not
I've done a small test underneath my
faucet to see if it holds water and it
pools it real nice and did not soak
through um I have no idea when we're
going to get a torrential downpour so I
can test this thing out so we're going
to create one using a
hose um is what I've used to waterproof
this or supposed we waterproof it is I
actually did a treatment of Nick
Wax and I just didn't feel that it was
going to be enough for it so then I went
ahead and bought this stuff called canb
back
and the uh the
canac went on decently well is what I
did is I put it in a garden sprayer
pumped it up and just sprayed it
on
well it stunk really bad so I was afraid
that it was going to um you know hold
that that smell and everything else in
um but once I got it around a smoky fire
and everything else it seemed to take
away a little bit of that um that smell
but not a whole lot so I'm not very
impressed with the canva th thus far
because of that smell but uh you know
like I said who knows it might go away
we'll
see but uh behind me is uh actually kind
of my version of the uh the plow point
and it's one of the many reasons why I
really dig this uh this tarp and it's
because of all those tie outs I can
actually really put it on there uh and
aner it down really well for wind and
all that good stuff so let me take you a
tour around this thing real quick and
then we're going to uh cause the
torrential downpour and see if it holds
up okay so as you can see I have an
exterior ridg Line running down the very
back of it right around the
spine and then I've got those tie outs
right there in the middle the tarp that
I can actually flare it out and hold
this thing open really nice
and the
inside actually has a good amount of
room oh my God there's a pretty woman in
my what are you doing in there just
relaxing hanging out but as you can see
there's a there's a good amount of room
in there uh my wife can um easily
stretch out in there and there's my very
pretty
daughter and uh she can also get in
there very easy and I can can get in
there I mean the three of us could sleep
in this thing no problem at all and you
can actually see that my big old uh
backpack is in there as well so plenty
of
room all right so let's get the hose out
and let's give this thing a good soaking
and uh let's see if we get wet shall
we I'll you
all over
it not just in one spot just like it's
raining
yeah get the very
top go ahead and get that
side real good there you
go all right so far it looks like it's
holding up pretty
well I mean little Mist droplets kind of
come through at times but I don't see
any
anything
pooling let me pull this pack
back if there's anything going on back
over
there you know you look at the if you
was to look at the outside of this right
now Heather you would think that it'd be
soaking through oh really but it's
actually
not no keep
going you can look at the back of this
thing and it's actually just
saturated I mean just
saturated but the inside of this thing
is just
completely completely
dry it is not soaking through at
all I'm
actually rather and
impressed that it's holding up the way
that it is I didn't expect it to
actually hold up like
this yeah and you can actually see that
it's holding a
puddle right there I'll crawl in here in
a second see if it's soaking through
through
and no it's
not she have a whole bunch right there
or something yeah there's a whole pool
of water right there that's not sucking
through not at all I don't know what
would happen if we touched it but yeah
you don't want to touch it you start
touching it a wick through then
all right guys well as you can see we
put this thing to the test and really
really soaked it down and I mean you can
still see that there's a big pool of
water sitting right there on that tarp
and it's not soaking through at all
so I like I said I honestly didn't think
that the can vac would hold up the way
that it did and you know I don't know if
it's a combination between the Nick Wax
and the canned back I don't know but uh
either way that combination seemed to
work really
well um now as far as how long is it
going to hold up only time will tell um
but I'm actually thoroughly impressed
with it so far so I think is what I'm
going to do is I think I'm going to let
this thing dry
off completely you know and then come
back to it and soak it down again and
see if it holds up and everything else
so thank you bug you have fun spraying
the tart yeah
yeah don't touch it it'll Wick through
then all right guys well I hope you've
enjoyed this video and as always have a
good one
