um and we're going to sand this and show
you how to do this we're going to start
with is a 1500 grit wet sand we're going
to go to 2,000 grit and then we'll do a
final sanding with 3,000 grit so we're
going to show you how to do this okay
here we are we got our little panel put
about four coats of clear on this and
also four coats of clear on this we
sprayed the whole panel we just taped
off half of it so you can see the
difference just color sanding it we used
some soapy water with some Automotive
car wash soap we have a 1500 grit 2,000
and then 3,000 and so we're just
basically going to start with our 1500
grit let's put it in here you can let
this sit for a few minutes it helps up
helps kind of separate it out and just
wrap it around
here and just go in One
Direction just like
this
now we'll turn in this
direction
if you hear any scratching then just
rinse off
your sponge so you don't rub dirt around
in
it and on the last one I like to kind of
go in a circular
motion get all your sand scratches
out
and when you're all
done use this to squeegee it
off you can just kind of towel dry it
and then you'll be able to
see
exactly what you still need to cut out
so we're just kind of fast forward
through this
and
all right this our last step we've
already cleaned it off make sure that
everything's nice and there's no
imperfections now we're going to take
our 3000 grit and do our final block
then after we do with this 3000 grit
we're going to go and do all our
polishing so let's do one little coat on
this and this is basically just so we
can get all the sand scratches off of
the 2000 grit so just go over it real
lightly doesn't have to be very abrasive
it's like you're trying to cut anything
you're just trying to get the sand
scratches off my general rule of thumb
on everything I ever do three passes so
I'll do a couple passes in this
direction I'll do a couple in this
direction and then I'll come back to
this direction and do the whole panel so
just if you go three times you should be
pretty safe safe and get rid of all your
scratches now you want to listen
especially on this phase on the
3000 you want to listen for anything
that you hear that might sound like a
scratch if you're hearing any scratching
stop because what's happening is you're
getting dirt underneath your sandpaper
and you don't want to scratch this panel
you just want to smooth it out so that's
pretty much it for color sanding go from
1500 to 2,000 to
3,000 then you clean your
surface check for any scratches or
imperfections and then from here we'll
go into polishing so polishing will be
the next
clip okay we're going to walk you
through how to polish this
panel got a couple different polishes
here I'm going to show you how to do it
high-speed buffer we're going to use a
wool pad with extra cut and from there
we're going to go to a cutting pad with
a mild cut then we're going to go to a
polishing pad with swirl remover
and get off all of our little swirl
marks then from there we're going to go
into using an
orbital with a wax now on fresh paint
this paint's only see the truck the
paint's only about a week
old uh we're going to actually show you
how to wax but I wouldn't wax it for at
least 3 months while the paint's drying
uh but other than that we'll show you
how to do it on this
video all right our first step we have
our wool pad and our extra cut now what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
apply a little bit actually on the pad
just cuz I'm not going to use very much
just start
slow
that's all I'm going to do for the wool
pad just CU extra cut we'll come back
and we'll do the mild cut now you want
to clean that compound off so we'll wipe
that all down now then we'll go over it
with a mild
cut and then a cutting pad same thing I
actually put it on the pad I just like
doing it that way you don't have to you
can put it on the panel if you want but
I like doing it this
way start slow in the middle it's kind
of work your way
out
[Applause]
[Applause]
he
just keep polishing until it goes
away all your polish is used
[Applause]
up now we do the next St okay now we're
going to clean this panel after we clean
that cutting compound off then we're
going to use a swirl
remover and a finishing polish ing
pad same thing put it on the
pad this is more kind of like a
finishing
compound
you can turn your speed up a little
[Applause]
bit
we'll come back and untape it and show
you what that looks like
like
