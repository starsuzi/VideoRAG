HOW TO REMOVE TAR FROM CARPET
Upon discovering the tar stain, determine
whether it is hard or still soft.
If it is soft, use a bag of ice or compressed
air to stiffen the spot.
If hard, scrape the tar with a dull edge to
remove any tar residue.
Vacuum the tar stain to get rid of any remaining
particles.
To create a cleaning solution, mix 1 cup warm
water and 1 tsp of liquid dish soap.
Apply this cleaning solution directly to the
tar stain.
Slowly work from the outside of the tar stain
to the center, moving slowly inward so you
don't spread the stain further onto the carpet.
Rinse the tar stain with cold water and continue
applying the soap solution until the stain
disappears.
Blot dry the area with paper towels or a shop
vac.
Another method is to Moisten the affected
area of the carpet with 3% hydrogen peroxide
or rubbing alcohol.
Let the tar stain sit for 1 minute.
Blot with a paper towel to absorb any remaining
stain.
Apply a few paper towels directly onto the
area with a weight and let it sit overnight.
