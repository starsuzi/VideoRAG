hi guys uh if you can see here at my
back this is my homemade incubator and
many have asked me how to
improvise a
homemade incubator if you have
sufficient capital then i advise that
you will buy the digital the one that is
available in the market but if
you are run short of capital and you
really wanted to start with this
business you can just
make
an incubator an improvised incubator
with the same effect with the same
result with that of the commercial
incubator
now this is made of a plywood
and as you can see here
this incubator will
can load up to 2000 eggs
so i have three incubators
that can load the 2000
eggs
so all in all i can
load
6000 eggs in a day
so this is how it is made i am going to
show to you
so this is very important
in order to control the hip this is the
insulator
so
you need to put this so that the heat
will not uh will be concentrated inside
it will not come out
and be sure that
and uh
this has
one two three
four five six seven eight
nine
10 layers
this homemade thing
incubator
for for you guys
so lisa
as you can see here
there are four
one two three four five six
bulbs incandescent light incandescent
light
and
this is 25 watts
and you need to put some air electric
one
that's electric one i have three
electric ones
to
bring up
the heat
so that the heat will be boiled inside
so this is it
and of course you have to put some
exhaust
i have here the exhaust here
exhaust
[Music]
the exhaust here
and the heat from the bottom will go up
and then you have the exhaust so this is
the thermometer
this is very important
because the heat required
is 100 degrees fahrenheit
for this
eggs to be hatched
so
it is very important for you to know the
temperature
and once you have reached the desired
heat which is 100 degrees fahrenheit
you will
you will
adjust the thermostat
if you can see here i have attached the
thermostat here
[Music]
[Music]
so you see
if you have the thermostat that is set
on 100 degrees fahrenheit it will
automatically off if it will reach 100
degrees fahrenheit
so that will automatically
shut off
because of the thermostat has been set
to 100 degrees fahrenheit now when the
incubator becomes cool
that the temperature is already below
the 100 degrees fahrenheit it will
automatically switch on because of the
thermostat and this is just very simple
if if you don't know this you can just
hire an electrician
but what is important is that you have a
a bulb incandescent lamp that is 25
watts
and then you have the thermostat
and of course you have that thermometer
and the electric fan and this is the
only thing you need
and you can do it yourself
and start this duct business
and one thing more
if you are making a homemade incubator
be sure that the bug portion of it there
is a space so that the
the air can can go up
there is a space here
space here so that the air can go up
so
this how simple it is you can do it
yourself
this is an incubator electric fan we
have the light bulbs
25 watts
one two three four five six light bulbs
with three electric ones
and you can already have a good hats of
your eggs
now the technique is
since this is not digital
from time to time
you have to remove the eggs
[Music]
and it is very important
since this is not an automatic incubator
this is homemade incubator
so this is manual meaning every
every day you have to move the eggs
to different positions
to prevent the ducklings to stick in one
portion of the eggs or to stick at the
shell so you have to move and change the
position of the eggs three times a day
this is very important
because if you will not do it the
tendency is that the the duckling inside
will stick to the shell
so
you have to move the position three
times a day
so this is very important
like that
move this in the morning
move this in the moon time
and in later in the afternoon
[Music]
so i
i also put some eggs on the chicken
and
as you can see there's a perfect hot
cheese
yeah newly hatched chicks
here
perfect
[Music]
it's perfect
so the new load
will be put at the bottom
this is the latest
we put at the bottom
and then
you will adjust it on the following day
you have to load again another batch of
eggs so this one will be placed at the
second
and then the new
the new eggs will be placed at the
bottom
and so on and so forth
because when the eggs
is in the inside incubator for 15 days
they will have
a natural hit inside
meaning that the the eggs after
it reaches 15 days inside the incubator
then it will be put at the top because
they need lesser heat
because the eggs now have already
a a built in a natural heat inside
so the new load
of eggs will be
placed at the bottom
and the old eggs load that will be
placed at the top
i hope that you were enlightened and of
course guys if you have some questions
please
leave your comment below and
if possible you can subscribe to this
channel
so that i can answer all your queries
that is not very clear of this video you
can just
put your comment and i would be willing
to answer all your queries
so again
this bulb is connected
to the thermostat
and the thermostat will regulate the
heat
which is that the desired heat which is
100 degrees fahrenheit i hope this video
will open up your mind
and
will allow you to have a good business
of that farming
so thank you and please don't forget to
