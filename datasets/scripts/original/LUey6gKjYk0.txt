okay so you're playing long doing some
crazy solo to some renx on and all of a
sudden you need a whammy bar oh I'm
playing a
Telecaster yeah no whammy bar don't
fret you don't need a whammy bar as long
as it has a Bol on neck just in
case how about that no whammy bar needed
nope
[Music]
or yeah no whammy bar needed there's the
neck band or the String Band either one
your choice whammy bars are for sissies
or you can just shake the crap out of
your guitar
that also works but we recommend the
neck Bend or the string Bend
yep any other words of advice Mr Guitar
Hero no sir all right bye thank good
luck young fellows
