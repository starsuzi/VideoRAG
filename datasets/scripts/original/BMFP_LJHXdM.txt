[Applause]
yeah hey this is Chris chandel with sand
mountains.com and today we're going to
be talking about how to start your seeds
in
Flats there's a there's Sand Mountain
Herb's youngest
uh owner here
Sarah come here and here here's pup
ball we don't to demonstrate on how to
sew seed in the 72
C seed
flaps pet it's a it's
a u pellets from Walmart Kmart or or
Lowe's or some other seed
place you swell these pellets
up these are already swollen in that you
just put water to them don't you yeah
they they actually is uh I prefer to
swell them up and let them dry out it
don't get you messy punch holes in in
them like
this you can use you can use a stick if
you want to yeah you can use a
stick if you don't get your get dirt
under your nails but if you're like most
gardeners you like a little dirt under
your nails and what we going to do is so
a few of
the we don't we don't sew a few of these
seed Tiny Seed this is
a Greek
oregano what I like to do is start
[Music]
[Applause]
these come here gal keep an eye on the
baby put a few of these in
each container like
this tell them why you want to do a few
each time uh you you get too many
growing it in the same
spot yeah and you do want to add a
couple just so so that one will grow and
you oh
yeah yeah you see
the don't work out as long as we got her
I see she's fine go ahead
and so so the seed in these pellets like
this
don't bring the doorbell
what her
Maria now you get those
toad I use a mixture of sand and peat
moss and just fill in the gouts between
each between each uh little pedet tell
them why this is a help conserve
moisture in
there and give the little tiny roots on
the side of chain to grow all right we
got got all
[Music]
them sewed like that then
you you take
the hose and and wet that down I'll get
oh we don't have to do it right now yeah
go ahead get the hose get the hose come
here
gal come here come here
Sarah get Sarah get her get her go
uh-uh don't put her on
that don't put her on that don't get her
up
her you soak them down and just and put
the top back on and you can pick up a
little rock or a little something to
hold keep the wind from blowing that
off keep these in
uh a shady area but enough light for
them to germinate like on the porch but
you don't direct hot light on them from
the sun because it go through there and
burn the little seedlings up and in 3 or
4 days you'll start maybe up to a week
to two weeks depending on the seed
you'll have little plant growing in each
one of those little
pipes if you got the markers you can you
can do a just a few at a time of
different things you can
you can write the little markers down
and you can start more than one kind but
make sure you know what you sewing where
they sew
that and you can keep these like
this under I like to use under trees or
under porch and those uh get a hold of
moisture on these seeds they start to
germinate once they start to germinate
and coming out of the take this off
because if you don't the seed it uh damp
fall pick up some fungus or something
these supposed to be ster but
everything all kinds of fungus fly
through the A and stuff so uh this keeps
them good and healthy and water them
about every 3 or 4 days depending on how
dry this gets and then if these little
FS get bigger with the seed the plant
you plant you can po them in a bigger
pot and then when they get big enough
you can take them to the Garden or put
them in a bigger pot so this is a you
it's two or three step ways of growing
them to a bigger
pot as it grow always increase the pot
size you can grow herbs on the front
porch or uh different places around your
house you can have them hanging you can
uh it just like you would a potted
flare so when you get ready what this
does is hold the moisture on them till
they the seed germinates and then you
can they ready to transplant and
somewhere else when it gets about maybe
a inch high maybe less than
that and but you after they get up you
don't want to keep that on there do you
no it uh it uh how about when it rains
what do you do
well uh once they get up pretty good you
can take them out and set them under a
tree without this you can set them on
a maybe a place on the ground that you
got till they start grow up a little bit
bigger and
then in the winter time you can on pay
attention to seed cause U and check the
internet for germination info on all
plants but in the fall of the year I do
this
on seed that needs cold
treated I'll plant them like this and
just set them out under tree of course
the tree will lose its leaves and it be
cold all winter but you'll be surprised
the little seedlings that pops out of
the
ground when when the temperature hits
around 60 70 degrees in the
spring this
uh and not all seed generates uh
germinates the first year I have had it
the seed go through two or three
years and maybe germinate a few and then
the next go through another winter they
germinate a few more and Pok salad is
the worst one in the world it's uh it'
Take 5 to seven years I have C cases 40
years that it before it popped out of
the
ground my sister under around her house
had this scrubber here all around her
house she pulled all that
out exposed the seed to the sun and the
moisture and she had it thck it's dog
hair all the way across her
mop they had been in the laying dormant
40 years in the
dirt he
[Music]
and it takes a long time lots of reading
lots of study and
experiments it it's uh lots of seed is
is real really hard to germinate they
they many little tricks but one thing
about it when when you put them outside
in nature and they in the right spot
they don't
germinate example of that they was
cutting a
pipeline up side of Sand Mountain they
took all the trees down Leaf cover for
40 years had been completely ignored I
put out all the forestry service had put
out Forest it didn't have a chance to
burn off but when they cut the trees and
started digging them trenches they B
they boogered all ass up and the next
spring it was billions and billions of
seed come up as far as you could see up
the side the mountain what plant all
kinds anything in the
woods they wanted to change the get out
from under that Leaf cover and they
wanted light and they wanted moisture
and when they got it they
exploded and then they
died uh like crowd too many of them
crowded each other
out and why I think J thing grows in the
woods it's a it'll grow in a pot real
good come here gal get her Sarah is
around root of trees and around Rocks
come here Sarah go get Sarah
