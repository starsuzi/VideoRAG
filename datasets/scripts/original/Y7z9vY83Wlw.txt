come come and listen to the sound come
closer listen listen to that ready ready
oh oh my oh my god
wow
[Music]
hello i am welcome to
the enchant sauce plate today i want to
take you
to genova in the region of liguria today
we are making the focaccia
genovese the original focaccia
where everything started we have so many
focaccias in italy from north to south
and all of them are beautiful but lots
of respect for the city of genova
the place where the focaccia was created
the town of genoa so i've got my
beautiful mixer
right now here and we need to mix our
ingredients
the first ingredient which is probably
the most important is the extra virgin
olive oil
good quality extra virgin olive oil put
about three to four spoons up to you the
more the better
and then i like to brush it a little bit
i like to brush it around
the mixing bowl just i just like it
so we want to use about four spoons of
good quality extra virgin olive oil
and then we add 200 mils of
just um room temperature water we put
just a little bit of flour and then we
put the dry yeast
the reason why i put a little bit of
flour is because the
yeast needs to eat when it's in action
so
the flour would be the food for the
yeast
like i said i want this focaccia to be
very nice and light
so we're gonna raise it for a few hours
um and i'm only using
one a little satchel of a dry
yeast it's about seven grams okay
so you put it in uh you mix and mix and
mix and mix it very well
so now we need to add about one spoon
of honey if you don't want to use honey
you can use
two teaspoons of sugar
and then we add the flour so i've got
350 grams of flour including the flour
we
used before so we only put half of this
for now
just half we keep the other off
for later now we add the ook
and we start mixing so mix slowly
at the beginning and then we
go all the way to the maximum
after about five minutes we want to add
[Music]
a little bit of salt about
7 to 10 grams
and the rest of the flour
and now we need to mix the dough
extremely well
for at least 15 to 20 minutes so put it
up
and go and do some something else if you
like
looks fantastic look at that
look at that nice moist
all right this is where the magic begins
we want to put a little bit of flour
on a kitchen bench or maybe just use a
wooden um
table if you can uh put some flour on
your hands
and then we want to get the dough
and we just put it on top of the flower
there
yeah this is so nice
and now what we do
we rest it we want to make sure
we rest it for about 15 minutes
let's do a cross and
cover it see you in about 15 minutes
there is a very important rule in this
recipe
you need to wait we need to be patient
because we need to wait for the focaccia
to rise
rice like a star we
need to cook the focaccia in a tray
and you want a non-stick tray and not
too deep
see this size is pretty good it should
be about this much
the reason why is because we want the
inside to be moist
also it needs to cook fast and the top
part to be
not that crunchy but just slightly
crunchy you know so if you make it too
thick it's not going to be the right
focaccia alla genovese
so what we do now we need to add the
extra virgin olive oil
this is another part very important part
and this is where you need the extra
virgin olive oil
and then we use a
brush or you can just use a paper towel
to just spread the oil everywhere
so after 15 minutes remove the
kitchen towel and what we're going to do
we want to make sure
our dough doesn't stick to the table
and then we want to fold it enough
and just spread it so
actually i can do it one more time maybe
fold it twice and just
spread it just like this
all right that's nice that's nice
and now we can put it in the tray so now
when we put in the tray we want to make
sure we spread the oil
on both sides it's going to be a great
focaccia
the reason why we add the extra virgin
olive oil on top
is because it helps after when we want
to spread the dough because we need to
make the focaccia shape
and also it prevents to get the crust we
don't want to have a crusty on top i
want the top to be a little bit crusty
but soft
so you need the extra virgin olive oil
so we just want to cover the dough just
um to
avoid the though to get too dry
after one hour look how much this
beautiful
focaccia dog grows look at that
look how beautiful and moist
and now it is important that we create
the shape
for this focaccia so you want to push
push push push against the sides
make sure our focaccia is nice and flat
well this is how the forgotten should
look like now we want to make sure we
add
salt to our focaccia
of course to give the nice flavor once
you put the salt
you want the focaccia to rest to rise
again
for maybe one more hour or even more if
you if you want
um and these will make it
the focaccia will make it very very
light you will love it
i don't make sense
guys is it rice or race i have no idea
what's going on here i'm learning please
let me know in the comment below rise or
race
you need to let it race all rice now you
need to let it rise
because it will be much lighter when you
eat it
and it will taste better so the
traditional focaccia is just made simple
with
salt and extra virgin olive oil but i've
got these beautiful
cherry tomatoes in the fridge and
they're beautiful and sweet so
why don't we use them huh so do you
agree with me
okay so after one hour this is what we
get look how beautiful it is
so as you can see the top part
still nice and moist nice and soft
the focaccia is almost ready but now we
need to add
some room temperature water on top
the water helps not to burn the top part
and it will give a nice a nice color
to the focaccia you get the nice white
color inside the holes
and then we want to put extra virgin
olive oil
yeah that's nice and now
we want to make sure the water in the
oil goes everywhere
every every way you need to apple all
your power in it
because we want to create the holes so
you press
press with energy you know press add
in order to create the holes you want
the water and the oil
to go inside the oils don't worry about
the water
because the water will disappear when
you when you cook
this beautiful focaccia
[Music]
now we want to put a cherry tomatoes
inside now the focaccia needs to rest
for about
one hour so until we have um until we
you know the dough
keep rising and it almost covers the
cherry tomatoes
um if you don't want to cook it in one
hour what you can do you can actually
put it in the fridge
but you need to take it out from the
fridge two hours before you want to cook
it now you don't need to cover the
focaccia
because you have the water on top it's
very moist and wet
on top so you don't need to worry look
how beautiful this focaccia is
see the way rice is perfect
so don't forget
the more you wait the lighter and maybe
more delicious
your focaccia will be ah smells so good
we need to put this in the oven at 220
celsius degrees
for about 15 to 20 minutes but keep an
eye on it
the water helps see it's not burned on
top
and it's actually gonna be just enough
uh
crunchy for us you know so nice
oh yeah
oh yes begging is not easy guys it's a
difficult job i need to be very
passionate about it um
you need to have a stand where you can
put your focus on
so we can let it breathe you know the
focus needs to breathe underneath
and on top look how stunning it looks
i'm very proud of this
look at the bottom what kind of this
look at that
golden golden at the bottom the top is
nice
see it's not burned thanks to the water
oh my god
and don't forget we have to say thanks
