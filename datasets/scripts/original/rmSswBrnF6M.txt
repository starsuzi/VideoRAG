Hi this is David from The Big Easy Catering
Company in Santa Barbara California for expertvilliage.com.
Right now we are doing the chocolate fountain
and we are melting the chocolate on top of
the double boiler. I have just added the oil
to the chocolate chips and you want to keep
a eye on this now. Make sure that you are
melting evenly and just is...and you would
see it smoother and smoother as it goes. The
reason that you want to add oil to this is
the chocolate fountain would be able to the
auger would be able to lift the chocolate
much more easier when it is more fluids. So
this is a real important step. Now you can
also use the microwave for this. I recommend
this method. It is easier to keep a eye on
and it is kind of fun. As you can see it is
melting very nicely. You want to keep working
from the bottom also so it doesn't stick.
