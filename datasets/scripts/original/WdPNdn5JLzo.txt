hi I'm Sally today I'm going to show you
how to plant out a terrarium first of
all I'm going to show you the products
we need our potty mix we're using Bonsai
mix today because that's appropriate for
the small plants we need the
Horticultural charcoal very small
Pebbles using a very small little Spade
today because we only got small plants
gloves very important a little plants
spray bottle and very important
our little terrarium once you've chosen
your container make sure you clean it so
that it's free of grime dirt and
stickers that may affect the life of
your plant first thing we do is put a
layer of pebbles in the terrarium for
water drainage you can use small stones
or gravel smaller the
better want this level to be 1 to 2
cm our next step is to add the
charcoal just do a small layer just
enough to cover the Rocks this is to
keep your terrarium alive and healthy
and next layer is the potty
mix you put in enough to cover the
plant's
Roots now because of the shape of this
bowl I'm actually going to be adding
more at the back than the
front once you add of the potty mix you
Pat it down to make sure you get rid of
any air
bubbles and next step is to dig small
holes to put in our plants you have to
make sure the holes are big enough for
their Roots you can use your hands or
your spade for this this terrarium I'm
going to use my
fingers when you're taking out your
plant you always be careful fingers
either side of the
plant and gently ease from the
pot once you put your plant in there
push the dirt back around your little
plant making sure you Pat it down once
again to take out any of the air
bubbles after you have your plants in
the terrarium you might wish to add some
decorations I'm just going to add some
more of these little
Pebbles made a bit of a decoration in
our terrarium
I'm just going to have it in a bit of a
line there so it looks a bit like a
little pathway coming down from in
between the
plants then you might add a little
figurine or even some
pretty larger
rocks after you've added your
decorations give it a spray to water the
plants and now you have your completed
terrarium
