Sleep is fundamental for our quality of life,
and for us to be healthy, both physically
and mentally. We need to sleep at least 7
to 8 hours a day. It’s important to renew
our energy every day, and we can only do that
by resting. It’s only during this period
of rest that this renovation happens, through
activation of many important functions.
As we know, nowadays people rest less than
ever before. Our lifestyle, bad eating habits,
stress, and other factors, contribute to the
development of sleep related problems. The
fatigue and lack of energy that come from
insufficient sleep can one day lead to cognitive
disturbances.
To treat insomnia, some people turn towards
stimulants that help them sleep, but these
kinds of pills cause dependencies and create
more problems than solutions. So, how can
we fix this problem without affecting our
health?
There are other naturally healthy ways to
help you sleep, without experiencing the side
effects common to industrialized pharmaceuticals.
Banana and cinnamon tea is great at treating
insomnia. It has become very popular due to
its relaxing properties that relieve stress,
improve sleep quality, and don’t cause addictions.
Bananas are rich in potassium and magnesium,
making them an essential part of our diets.
These minerals are responsible for regulating
our blood pressure, reducing liquid retention,
relaxing muscles, and reducing cortisol. Cortisol
is a hormone that causes stress and can be
harmful in large quantities.
Here is where the banana comes in. It also
has an amino acid called tryptophan that increases
serotonin production. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter
that aids sleep.
Cinnamon also has several healing properties
due to the eugenol that regulates your metabolism
and reduces blood sugar levels, making it
perfect for type 2 diabetics. Eugenol is what
gives cinnamon its strong flavor, aids digestion,
and balances your circulatory system. Digestive
and circulatory problems are normally related
to sleep, and cinnamon can help with that.
This tea is easy to make and super cheap.
Drinking it helps with stress and anxiety
related problems, giving you quality sleep.
Here’s how to make it:
Ingredients
1 banana,
½ teaspoon of cinnamon,
1 liter of water.
Instructions
Cut the ends of the banana without removing
the peel and put it in a pot with boiling
water. Turn the stove on low and let it steep
for 10 minutes. Then turn off the stove and
let it cool.
Strain the liquid, add the cinnamon, and mix
well.
Drink a cup of this tea 40 minutes to an hour
before going to bed and repeat this procedure
every night until you start falling asleep
easier. Your battle against insomnia will
finally come to an end! Don’t forget to
try and improve your eating habits and create
a stress-free environment. If you do all of
this, your lifestyle will be healthier, and
you will feel great.
