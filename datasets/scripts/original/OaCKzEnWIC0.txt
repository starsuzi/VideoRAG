hi I'm Chris Vorhees executive Su Chef
here at contemporary catering and I'm
going to show you how to make fuzzy
naval punch basically take your
Shaker some
ice about 6 oz of OJ
typically 2 O of peach
snobs these items are kind of subjective
uh you can obviously uh change them in
uh their volume as much as you want or
decrease them as much as you want based
on the taste preference um most these
are all subjective I like a little more
alcohol in my drinks but you may not
we'll also do a little bit of fresh
sliced peaches couple ounces and one
fresh sliced wedge of orange juice take
those seal them up tight in your
Shaker give them a good shape for a
couple
seconds
release ice in your glass
strain that then we'll garnish it with a
little bit of fresh sliced
Peach and orange wedge I'm Chris and
that's how you make a fuzzy naval punch
