welcome back to you pended I tried it
today I saw this
amazing pen I've been wanting to do on
Pinterest um it's pretty much wine
bottles filled with lights and I saw it
on my boyfriend mom's wall and I just
knew I had to do it so we decided to do
it today stay tuned okay so we're going
to do the clear lights in the bottle so
here's my wine bottle and then um we
have the drill bit right here the size
is 38 and here is the Min lights that we
just got at Walmart for really cheap it
was only

$2.50 have to be
careful so right here um Zach is holding
on to the bottle um very securely it's
very tedious so you have to be extremely
careful because the glass can still
break with the drill beit it is 3/8 and
it is for glass and tile but you still
have to be
careful um that's the brand that we use
it was actually Century
brand and that's him continuing to drill
it you can break you can break the
lights and I will just get the mini
lights
also while you're
going a little bigger you have to

the CH there's a better one than
you in that last part you probably saw
my boyfriend have some icing he actually
added it to the bottle so it'll be a
little bit better when he broke a hole
to it so the drill bit won't slip and we
can actually have a
more now we're putting the lights in one
by
one you have to be really really really
really
careful was really cool too is
um my boyfriend mommy actually would pin
this on her board and I saw it so we
just decided to come over and do it
together I'll help her hold the
bottle okay so what's a really good tip
too is what my boyfriend's mommy said
was you when you put and the light
have try to align the string and the
light together like what she's putting
doing right now and then slip it through
cuz we'll go a lot easier Don't Force It
Through cuz this does take a good while
to get all 50 lights in the
bottle
there we
go okay so here's the end result of our
bottle of
fairies this is the one that um Zach's
mom made and she pinned on her wall and
this is the other one that she helped me
with and Zach dral
