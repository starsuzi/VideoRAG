- This is How To Drink,
a show about making cocktails
and how to drink them.
I'm Greg and I have never
been a professional bartender.
I've never even had a job in a bar.
I don't worry too much about
precision and technique,
because at the end of the day,
if the drink you like is in
the glass, you did it right.
Let's get going.
(soft jazz music)
This week, we're partnered with Luxardo,
we're gonna make an Amaretto Sour.
The Amaretto Sour is
actually a really tasty drink
but you have to make it the right way.
Amaretto is a Italian
liqueur made from almonds
and a few other things.
Probably dates back to about the 1500s,
there's a couple of myths about
who invented it and where.
I won't dive into that.
The Amaretto Sour is kinda one of the
bad old drinks of the 1970s
that has been recently updated
by Jeffrey Morgenthaler
into the Morgenthaler Sour
or the modern Amaretto Sour
which is made with bourbon
and it is so much better.
So let's shake it up and make it.
So we need a shaker,
we're gonna put an egg
white into the shaker,
then an ounce of lemon
juice, whoa there it goes.
Then one and a half ounces of Amaretto.
I need three quarters
on an ounce of bourbon.
I'm gonna use this bush bourbon.
I need a quarter ounce
on rich simple syrup.
So we've got all of our
ingredients into the tin.
I wanna dry shake this drink
because it has an egg white in it.
You don't have to dry shake
it, as a matter of fact,
if you shake the heck out of it,
you'll get to the same place.
But it can help you get a little bit more
of a head on your drink.
Some people like to take the
spring off of their strainer
and toss it into the shaker.
And when it shakes, it
kind of helps to aerate it.
I don't know, I don't do that.
I think its more trouble than it's worth.
I just shake really hard
and then I don't need to take apart,
clean, and put my strainer back together.
If you like to do that,
that's a great way to go.
I like to have my sours in something
with a little bit of a stem on it.
And as it sits, it's going to develop
that nice frothy head.
I'm gonna garish this drink
with a little cherry action.
Can't really go wrong with that.
Just lay it right across the front there.
And let's give it a taste.
My garnish fell in but...
That doesn't matter
because it's delicious.
Oh my god.
(laughs)
Oh that is nice, that is nice.
It's sweet, but not too sweet.
It's not syrupy at all.
It's just really a light tasty drink.
I kinda wanna drink all of it.
Um, I kind of wanna drink all of it.
Yeah, that's good, we're
gonna finish this one.
I'm definitely gonna finish that drink.
Wow, that's good.
Jesus, that's good.
That...
You know what else is good?
These cherries.
I think I am...
Oh!
Oh my god.
Thanks for watching the show guys.
I had a really good time
making this drink for you.
The Amaretto Sour is
definitely one of my...
It's in the pantheon, it's a good one.
Thank you to Luxardo for
helping us make this episode.
If you like the show,
I hope you subscribe.
I like to hear from your comments.
It looks like I need
another Amaretto Sour.
I guess I better get to work on that.
