all right this is something I just
thought of might be pretty important to
mention to people when you start to take
your washer out you know once they're
kicking it and beating it and asking it
why got to screw up today ain't enough
stuff going wrong just uh make sure you
turn both these off you know you're cold
and you're
hot and you know me I put bottle caps on
it cuz you know if you'll notice they do
drip water still even when you cut them
off all right just figured y'all need to
know that
also make sure that you try to get as
much water out of the washing machine as
possible
because it gets water everywhere as soon
as you try to move this
thing all right uh here's my broken
washer and pretty much what happened is
that I tried cutting it on and it washed
my clothes but it just decided not to
spin for some reason so I was going to
call some random dude to fix it but now
I'm like you know what screw that I'm
just going to do this thing
so I looked around and I found
this see if my phone will
focus and uh I did some research on it
and apparently it's called a
coupler and they turned out to break on
a lot of people's washing machines and
so every time that you call that
mechanic to come out here
and fix on it for like hundreds of
dollars you're pretty much just getting
screwed out of your money because it
really only costs like 20 bucks but
anyway I guess I'm going to just show
y'all how to fix it I don't know how to
fix it yet but you know I'm going to
give this a shot see how this turns
out
so pull that off
somehow I'm pretty sure you'd have to
take this all cuz you know I mean it's
at the top of it that thing's way down
here apparently I got to get to
it just give everybody a full view of
it and just take out the back
clamp and Pull It piece up this is
really hard to do
onehanded
just
wow this is going great so
far what did I do with that other
clamp y i oh it's still hooked on there
go and pull that off
too I was just going to fix this and be
like no I don't make the embarrassing
movie but now I'm like somebody else
could have their crap break
and end up like me and just end up
tinkering with stuff and y'all may not
fix it I'm GNA fix it though
because because I'm going to I don't
know how yet but I'm going
to mostly cuz I can't afford to be
calling some
guy also one of these comes in
handy all
right what is wrong with you all
right apparently that looks like a motor
to me from all the
cools I could really scrap this thing
but I'm
not just pull that screw
out you know I'm starting to really
think maybe they may have done this on
purpose so you know you call them and
they'd be like hey yeah we'll fix this
thing I'm whereare I'm wearing a kitchen
glove that's cuz I
don't really want to be messing around a
big Rusty area hadn't had a tetanus shot
a while
and don't need my girlfriend freaking
out again about the whole tetanus
thing you don't have to wear glove I
chose
to all right
God this is hard to do with one
hand just really investing like
something to hold the
camera
yeah God this would be so much easier
with two
[Music]
hands uh screw this hold on a second all
right so got two gloves
now can't really hold the camera while I
take that up but pretty much I'm just
going to remove this clamp and there's
one right behind
it back here that I'm noticing it's all
seems to be big thing of common sense
going on here but uh just going to do
this and get this out the way so I can
get done making this
movie
whoa oh come
on
okay just noticing there are some screws
in in the bottom of this thing or
something so apparently I'm going to
have to take those out
too cuz this can't just be
easy all right hold on by the way best
thing to use for the clamp so you do not
cut your hand screwdriver just found
that out just saying okay so got the
motor out turns out those aren't screws
they're just pads I'm apparently just a
special person I don't know
and that is the cup I was talking about
see how this residue it's cuz apparently
I was shredding this thing the piece is
trying to figure out why it was not
going to work and uh punch in a washing
machine it doesn't fix it does not fix
it at
all
yeah
see there's a broken leg on
it why would they make this out of
plastic see this is what I was saying
before about the never mind I'm just
going to fix this thing
okay it's hard to remove than I thought
apparently I have wedged that thing in
there pretty good there's one on this
side too and all of the legs have been
broken off of
it cuz I was stubborn and instead of
fixing I was just like no I'm just going
to keep hitting this thing and punching
it and constantly cutting it on and off
because that's what I
do it just kind of Pops off but the
problem is is is you know if you have a
you know wash machine like this it it's
old so it's all rusty crap but
this is part of a coupler I did research
on it show yall the web page probably I
don't
know hadn't really figured out where I'm
going with this video
yet
Also may clean this thing out a little
bit usually the cleaner stuff is the
better it runs I don't
know okay here's the other part of the
coupler see how it's got arms on
It come on camera Focus
here oh my
God anyway y'all can see a good enough
screw it
this is another part of the
coupler what did I do with oh
yeah all these pieces sort of just like
fit
together
like I mean it's common sense I mean you
know how it goes
together you know other side other side
you know whatever boom so I got it
out as you can see this is the
coupler
it's pretty obvious how it's going to go
together when you order the other
one really phone and uh there
is I'm pretty sure that SARS or somebody
online's going to sell this
or I don't know I don't know her name
but Cody Griffin's grandma she like
works over there at
wal well not at w like the quick stop
but uh what is that place called it's
place got all the fridges and stuff out
so I'm pretty sure she may have one of
these but uh I'm just going to get that
part and you know going to just put it
all back together and I'm pretty sure
this thing's going to
work
hopefully all right and I'm
back so I went to the store and I got
the
part and like I said earlier Cody
Griffin's Grandma she's got all kind of
different stuff I mean yeah the store
isn't that pretty or anything but uh
she's got all smash didn't go away she's
got all kind of different parts so I
guess I'm going to just put this thing
back in there and hurry uping in this
video all right pretty much what I'm
going to do is
just put this thing in
there
and goes right right in there just going
to put it in the same way that it came
out
all right that piece a little hard to
put on there but so I'm going to just
tap it on all right so got that piece on
now I just got to put this piece in
there which I'm just going to leave the
rubber part
on see if y'all can see this and it just
kind of pops on
there
all right I was
wrong it's just a pad goes right in
there apparently they do not just go in
there real easy because that was really
tight fit it's probably CU this is this
may not be the right kind but uh you
know it's still a coupler and I'm pretty
sure it's going to
work all
right I just got to pick this thing
up and put it back in in
there yeah probably be safer to do to in
all
right got the motor back in there uh if
you'll look now see how the coupler is
in there pretty good it's tight it's got
the rubber piece around
it and it looks like we might be in
business
here everything seems to turn with it
now now that's a good
thing wasn't doing that earlier at
all now we just put everything back
together the way it came off
so
clamps all right pretty much y'all know
the deal we put a clamp here I'll put a
clamp
there all right so got the clamps on
and now best thing remember is to screw
it
down
okay just get my little adjustable
out
all
right now we got the screws
in all right so we're going to put the
white piece
on and uh these are my rusty clamps so
I'm going to be using hold it
down probably could have cleaned those
off but you know what do I care my
clothes aren't touching
it so you find little slots like
this they're easy to spot they stick out
and and you just put the clamp in and
you twist it and then you got a
clamp
amazing white piece down line it up pick
your clamp up clamp that side
down now you got one side down but you
have two
clamps makes
things easy if you got it clamp down I
guess and uh just clamp this side
down and there you
go I guess that's it it's fixed so
so guess the best thing to do is drag
this thing all the way back into the
linger room and see if it
works all right so I got the washer back
in the laundry
room and there was something I forgot to
mention once
again your drain hose I took that off at
the beginning I just forgot about it uh
pretty much oh my God uh pretty much
just you know goes there it's real
simple tighten the clamp down
and once you get done with that uh I'll
show you what happen all right once you
got it in there pretty
snug here comes the grand finale it's
time to hook all this crap back
up just get my
hoses
now this can be a problem because I
really do not remember which one came
off which cuz I was pretty angry when I
took this part
off well I know this one goes to cold
water and usually cold water is on the
right so I'm just going to go with that
and I'm going to test it and I'm going
to see how that
works by the way you can probably take
the hose off right there if you wanted
to uh I didn't cuz it's way easier just
to get it from right
here so whatever you do I don't
know all
right tight enough I'm going to get the
other
hose and I'm going to do the same
thing
now we got your drain
hose and mine's kind of ghetto but I'm
just going
to it's not really how A lot of people's
drain hose is going to look but that's
how mine looks so you know don't
hate just going to pull this washer a
Little
Closer
so I can reach it
better so
now nothing left left to do but you know
plug it in all right here's the
washer and it's completely finished
now fixed it
and you know it does all it stuff now
and best of
all spinning again
which was the problem it was not
spinning early now it spins so there you
go all right well I mean I can show you
how it's spinning
again completely fixed completely
fixed zero training whatsoever in this
just kind of winged it it's really easy
to do it's mostly just common sense and
you do it yourself I went to Cody's
grandma she gave me
like God I forgot I saying I went to
Cody's
grandma and she gave me the coupler that
I needed and we're online you know it's
going to run me like 20 bucks to have it
here the next day I just went over to
her got it for like 12 bucks popped the
thing in and you know has it
scen
spinning I know I keep doing that over
and over but I'm just so proud that I
fixed this thing cuz I've never worked
on one of these
before
