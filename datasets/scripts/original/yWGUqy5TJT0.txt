we're going to show you how to clean and
care for a Blanco Sil granite porador
sink
stains and signs of daily use can easily
be removed with a scouring sponge water
and a little washing up liquid
after cleaning just rinse with water
and wipe dry
often greasy residues remain in the sink
after washing up greasy items
a little washing up liquid on a sponge
is all you need to remove even stubborn
greasy stains from your Sil granite sink
again just rinse when you've finished
and wipe dry to prevent lime scale marks
metal objects can leave visible marks on
the hard surface of Sil granite
these marks are easy to remove with a
little washing up liquid
ideally use the Rough Side of a scouring
sponge
incidentally the best way to avoid land
scale marks is to wipe your sill granite
sink dry with a microfiber cloth after
every use
for stubborn lime scale marks or
discoloration we recommend cleaning the
sink thoroughly with a standard
detergent or Blanco active
designed specifically for Blanco Sil
granite poradura sinks it provides the
most effective results
first close the sink and then
sprinkle Blanco active powder liberally
around the bowl
then fill the bowl with at least 60
degrees Centigrade hot water from the
tap or ideally from a kettle
sprinkle a few cups of the solution over
the drainer surface and anywhere else
where there are limescale deposits
leave Blanco active to work for at least
two hours and ideally overnight
when you finish soaking the sink clean
it with a scouring sponge and wipe it
dry
and you can be sure of the perfect
cleaning results
if a sink is used for several years
without being cleaned and cared for
regularly it can be left with marks on
the surface that make it look as if it
is discolored
Blanco active dissolves this layer of
dirt and restores the sink to its
original color
to retain the quality of your Blanco Sil
granite porador sink please observe the
following
wipe your sink dry after every use
clean the sink thoroughly at least every
four weeks with Blanco active or a
standard detergent
