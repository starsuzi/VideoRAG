beautiful and delicious cheesecake. You will
need 1¼ c. graham cracker crumbs ⅓ c. butter,
melted 2 tsp. sugar ¼ oz unflavored gelatin

2 c. chocolate chips 14 oz. condensed milk

pan. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom
of the pan to form the cheesecake crust. You
can use two 9-inch graham cracker crusts instead
of the springform crust. Step 2. Combine the
gelatin and water in a small saucepan, and
let it sit for 1 minute. Then place it over
low heat, stirring constantly until the gelatin
melts completely. Then remove it from the
heat. You can also substitute orange juice
for the water and garnish with grated orange
peel for a twist on the traditional cheesecake.
Step 3. Melt the chocolate chips in a small
saucepan, stirring constantly. Step 4. Mix
the melted chocolate with the cream cheese
in a large bowl until it's fluffy. Then add
the condensed milk and beat until the mixture
is smooth. Step 5. Stir the gelatin into your
cream cheese mixture and fold in the whipping
cream. Step 6. Pour the mixture into the graham
cracker crust and refrigerate your cheesecake
for 3 hours. Step 7. Run a knife around the
edge of your cheesecake to loosen it. Remove
the side of the springform pan, garnish the
cake with chocolate shavings, and serve. Did

ancient Greece. Small cheesecakes were served
to athletes at the first Olympic games in
776 B.C.E.
