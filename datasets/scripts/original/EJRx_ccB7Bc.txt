welcome to cake playground where it's
all about the
fun this lesson is on how to make a
magnolia from modeling
chocolate the modeling chocolate gives
the Magnolia a beautiful waxy look and
are delicious they can be used on top of
cupcakes and on top of cakes in an
arrangement you will need the following
materials and
Equipment white and dark chocolate
modeling choc a small rolling pen a
cutting mat corn starch a five petal
cutter and a leaf
cutter a forming cup a small knife
gumpaste tool ball tool and a small
spatula you will also need a thick piece
of
foam a paintbrush some gold Luster Dust
and a paper
towel we will start out by Rolling the
modeling chocolate out to an even
thickness of about an eighth of an inch
when you start working with a modeling
chocolate it's a little hard and crumbly
so you will need to press it between
your fingers and warm it up in your
palms and knead it in small little
batches and then mix the little batches
together till it's the consistency that
you want when the modeling chocolate is
about the consistency of Play-Doh kind
of flatten between your hands and then
finish the flattening with a rolling pin
you're going to roll from the center out
and turn 90°
if you have trouble lifting it from the
mat just use a small spatula get
underneath it and loosen it from the mat
that way you can lift it and turn it
90° continue rolling to an even
thickness of 1/8
in cut the petals with a small
five-petal cutter press the cutter into
the
dough and then you're going to rub the
cutter against the mat to help cut the
modeling chocolate away from the cutter
hold the cutter while you pull the
excess modeling chocolate
away turn the cutter and smooth any
rough
edges press the petals out with your
fingers now we're going to cup the
petals using a thick piece of foam and a
ball tool press pretty firmly on the end
of The Petal to form the cup and then
roll toward the center do the same with
all five
petals when you have completed all five
petals and they look like this you can
move them over to a forming cup while
you work on the next set of
petals when the petals are in the
forming cup use the small end of the
ball tool to press lightly in the
center roll and cut another set of
petals but we're only going to use three
of them for the inner petals so cut away
two with a small knife and set them
aside
cut the other three petals into
individual
petals and then cut the tip off of each
petal for each of the three inner
petals we're going to roll them on the
foam and then pinch the
end and then flatten the
end add these three petals to the petals
you have in the forming cup I'm going to
use my finger and the gumpaste tool to
press these petals into the petals I
already have in the forming cup all you
need is a little pressure to stick them
to the other
petals so when you're done the petals
should look like
this next we're going to form the dark
Center so take a piece of the dark
modeling chocolate and roll it until
smooth this is about the size of a PE
put it in into the center of the
Magnolia and then press with the small
end of the ball tool so that you form a
little cup in the dark
chocolate next you're going to make some
little dots on the outer edge of the cup
with your gumpaste tool to make the two
leaves roll out some white modeling
chocolate and I'm using a small leaf
cutter to cut out the two leaves again
I'm rubbing the modeling chocolate
against the the mat to help cut it then
press out the two
leaves use the narrow end of your
gumpaste tool to make some veins in the
leaves you don't have to be exact these
are kind of fantasy flower leaves but
make sure that the veining is all going
the same direction and give some veining
down the
center your Lea should look something
like
this if you want to you can add some
gold highlights
put some Luster Dust onto a paper towel
and with a paint brush apply a small
amount of highlights start in the middle
and work out but not too much in the
highlights a little goes long
way you can also add some gold
highlights to the leaf just go down the
center and put the heaviest amount on
the center of the
leaf and on the tip of the
leaf again don't be too heavy-handed
and here we have the finished
Magnolia now you can do this in a
variety of Shades and variations on the
petals and on the centers as I've done
here they make a great decoration that
is tasty and
beautiful come to cake playground.com
