hey are you Savvy naturalistas welcome
to DIY Saturday today is the second
installment in our mosquito repellent
series AKA I ain't getting no zika no no
no no zika although
I did get bit my mosquito when I was
working in a garden that's why I made
these lotion bars initially I usually
put mixed coconut oil with a little
citronella oil and I use that when I
work in a garden but this time I'm using
these lotion bars and they're really
working well for me so I'm making a few
to give away to my co-workers because
they all have Gardens as well and they
tend to work in their Gardens it's a tip
for you guys who have Gardens you should
try putting long sleeves clothes on but
you know what I'm not going to give you
that tip due to the fact that I did that
and I still got bit you guys I still got
bit and when I I first moved to Arizona
we have this like tiger mosquito and it
used to bite me and I would get bites
like after it will bite me the bites
would get this big on my legs like they
were huge because I don't know I think
apparently I was allergic to the tiger
mosquito or I had a really bad allergic
reaction but I would have like
golf-sized mosquito bites and they would
be really really hard and lumpy so if
you're that type of person that gets bit
you really want to try these lotion bars
citronella oil is a very strong scent
and some people don't like it and I just
want to give you guys a variety of
scents you can use besides citronella
oil so let me show you what you'll need
DIY you will need coconut oil
I'm using this coconut oil we're just
you just need just a little bit of
coconut oil for this tutorial you guys
you will also need beeswax now you can
use the pellets these are easier to make
this recipe with uh but I will be you or
you can use this type of beeswax this is
the uh type that wasn't bleached this is
the all natural kind should look this
color I did get this on amazon.com so
I'm Gonna Leave You guys links as to
where I got this at but it's Amazon and
it works really really really well in
the recipe
you will also need
um shea butter and cocoa butter now I
made this myself so it's one part shea
butter and one part cocoa butter but if
you don't have shea butter or coconut
but uh cocoa butter you can use any uh
you could just use all shea butter if
you now let's get to my favorite oh you
also will need miracle glow oil because
this is a moisturizing uh bar so you
will need miracle glitter or you guys
now let's get to the essential oils my
favorite part
is a wonderful essential oil to get rid
of flies so flies really don't like
peppermint and it's worked for me in the
past so I'll be using just a little bit
of peppermint
um I will be using citronella oil of
course I got this at a different website
um I did get my peppermint on amazon.com
I will be using lemongrass for you guys
um now with lemongrass oil I'm going to
use more lemongrass than the rest of
them because lemongrass is known
mosquitoes do not like lemongrass
whatsoever so I will be using lemongrass
I love the smell of lemongrass and you
will also need lemon essential oil now
with lemon essential oil is it okay
there you go you will need lemon
essential oil mosquitoes do not like
lemon essential oil they do not like
lemongrass and they do not like
citronella essential oils
the lemon family is seen
or mosquito lotion bars okay so we're
getting ready to make our mosquito
repellent lotion bars and of course I
don't have the proper utensils as always
so you will need
um a tablespoon and a half a tablespoon
so we're doing
two one tablespoon and I'm just gonna do
two scoops but this is a half a
tablespoon so one tablespoon of beeswax
you will need
uh four tablespoons of
your coconut cocoa butter and Shea
Butter mixture
so
I have already pre-measured it so I'm
just gonna put it in
now you need
two tablespoons of coconut oil
um you will need
10 drops of Miracle glow oil and you can
find this at savinaturalista.com we're
no longer on amazon.com so now you can
only find it at Sammy naturalista.com
one two
now let's get into our essential oils
you will need five drops of peppermint
essential oil
thank you
will need
now when you use a pipette you can use
different drops I'm just not going to do
that this time because
I don't have
any right near me
you will need just make sure it's really
clean because you don't want your
peppermint to mix with your
lemon you will need five drops of lemon
essential oil this you will need
citronella oil and I'm using about 10
drops of this
citronella oil is very very potent so
you don't want too much and you don't
want too little you want just the right
amount to keep the mosquitoes away but
you don't really want to smell like
citronella oil a lot of people don't
like this scent they find it to be very
um not pleasant it's not a pleasant
scent
so if you find citronola oil not to be
pleasant you can just replace citronella
oil with lemongrass or more lemon if
you're just not a fan of citronella oil
and you will need 20 drops of lemongrass
you need 20 drops I just took the tab
off because it was a little too thick
and I'm going to put 20 drops in
now we're going to put this on
um in the pot you can use a double
boiler but I'm just going to use a pot
and I'll see you guys when we put it on
the pot
okay so right now our
mosquito repellent lotion bars are
melting you want to have oh just if
you're using a large pot make sure you
have just a little bit of water
let me zoom out a little bit for you
guys
there we go make sure you have just the
uh water is filled not all the way
because you don't want the steam to get
into your uh bars because this is our
all moisturizing oils and you don't want
any water in them because of course oil
and water doesn't mix and it'll make
your bars um look a little washed a
little uh they won't be as solid so
that's what you want to do so we're
going to melt this down on medium heat
color lotion bar mixture has been melted
now with will say with these ratios it
smells so good you guys
um it smells like almost a rainbow like
rainbow Skittles
and I haven't had Skittles in forever
and this smells delicious uh now I added
Shimmer for visual effect not only did I
add Shimmer for visual effect also I am
giving a few of these away as well as
using them for myself so
um the ladies I work with tend to like
Shimmer on their body so I just added a
little Shimmer
um I got Shimmer at online uh and it's
body Shimmer um I forgot the website so
I'll probably leave it the link down
below or in the blog post and make sure
you guys check out the blog post so this
is what it looks like
and we're going to pour
now that our mosquito repellent lotion
bars have been poured in our mold I'm
gonna let them cool down a little bit it
really is pretty hot so I may have have
to add them to the freezer but this is
what they'll look like and I'll see you
guys when they're done oh our bug
repellent our mosquito repellent wax
smells have finally dry so I want to
show you guys what they look like
they have a bit of a shimmer
see how beautiful they are
and what happens is this Shimmer you
just rub the Shimmer on you and it's
just beautiful
the Shimmer
and you rub it into your skin
and you Sparkle all day
so a lot of people in my job really like
Shimmer so that's why I did it
um
this is a really easy recipe beads uh I
added just a little bit of citronella
oil so they won't smell so I really hope
