Welcome to Show Me the Yummy episode 34.
Today we're making an easy shrimp alfredo.
Now, you may notice that things look a little
different today.
And that's because today is a special day.
Today is our one year anniversary.
Happy Anniversary.
Happy Anniversary.
You look beautiful.
Thanks.
So today's recipe is especially important
to us because it's the recipe that I first
made for Jennifer on our first date.
We also had it and I cooked it for her the
day we got engaged.
And now, we're making it for our one year
anniversary.
So, to celebrate we were actually provided
with a really nice bottle of merlot from Avignonesi.
I'm not Italian, I'm sure I'm not saying that
very well.
And so we are going to have a little wine
while we cook dinner because that's what we
like to do when we're making dinner just Jennifer
and I.
We like to have a little wine while we cook.
There you are.
Cheers.
Alright.
Mmm.
Ooh, that's... that's really good.
That's really good.
Let's get started and I'm gonna prep our veggies
and then we'll come back and show you how
this things put together.
[Music]
Alright, so all of our ingredients are all
prepped and ready to go.
Are you ready?
I'm so ready.
Ha, okay.
Alright, so we're just going to start with
some extra virgin olive oil.
Get that in the pan and then we're going to
add in our butter.
And we're just going to let all of this melt.
It smells amazing already.
Okay, then we're going to add in our diced
onions.
Now, we are just going to cook these until
they have softened.
And now while I was cutting up all of the
veggies, Jennifer and I started talking about
the night that we got engaged.
And we thought...maybe we'll tell that story
and that would be fun.
Mm hmm.
So it all starts when we were heading to Maui
to get engaged.
I had been hiding the engagement ring for
about a month.
Was it really a month?
Oh yeah, I had it for like a month.
And these are looking pretty translucent so
I'm actually going to add my red bell pepper
and that is my cue for when I drop the pasta.
That means we're about eleven minutes from
being done.
So I'm gonna get this stuff in there and I
am going to drop our pasta in our pot of boiling
water.
I wish you guys could smell this right now,
it smells incredible.
So I got that going back there and I'm just
going to soften up these red bell peppers
a bit.
Back to the story.
So I hide the ring and then Jennifer unbeknownst
to me at the time, goes searching while I
was on a conference call, I had to do a little
work.
And goes searching through all of the luggage.
No, I asked if I could unpack the bags.
That's right.
Because I thought maybe he might be asking
me to marry him.
So, I was like, if he lets me unpack the bags
then we're not getting engaged.
Because there's no way he'd of hidden the
ring at that point.
So she was convinced that we were not getting
engaged on this trip.
Yup.
Which was brilliant for me.
Flash forward about four days.
I decided this was the day that I'm gonna
ask Jennifer to marry me.
And I needed to get everything set up.
But the problem is, we're with each other
twenty four seven.
We're on vacation.
So it's difficult to sneak away.
So we're down by the pool at the resort that
we were staying at and the only thing that
I could think of was to say that I was having
some issues and I needed to go find a restroom.
Oh my god.
It's embarrassing but it worked.
Alright, those look like those are getting
nice and soft so I'm going to add our garlic
in.
And we're also gonna add in our portobello
mushrooms that I've just roughly chopped.
Jennifer at this point thinks that I'm in
pain which is fine.
I'm running around trying to get this whole
thing organized.
I'm talking to the pool, the cabana people,
saying can I rent one of these beach front
cabanas.
Yeah.
That are normally just used for people with
lounge chairs.
I was like, can I move the lounge chairs out
and get a table.
They're like, we don't have tables so I gotta
go to the restaurant.
In between each of these I gotta go back say,
I feel much better.
And then thirty minutes later, oohh, more
trouble.
Gotta go.
And I'm doing these like mission impossible
style meetings with all these different people.
So I have it all set up.
Of course there's no stove.
All we have is this like.. what was it?
Like a skillet.
It's like a skillet.
That you plug in.
Like a powered skillet.
You know it's got the two plugs that go in
the side.
Yeah.
I don't know if you've used one of these before.
So, now this is all incorporated nicely and
it's, it looks like it's to a nice place so
I'm just going to add in our shrimp now.
Now we're just going to cook the shrimp until
it slightly starts to get pink.
The reason is, this is going to keep cooking
for awhile and we don't want that shrimp to
get overcooked.
So anyway, back into the hotel room.
I'm cooking dinner.
We open a bottle of wine similar to tonight.
And I'm trying to seem like everything is
normal.
But, by the way.
They're not setting this stuff up down at
the beach for me.
I have to go and set it up.
So I'm cooking and then I come up with the
excuse, "Oh, wouldn't it be nice if we had
some candles" So I say, "I'm gonna go down
to the little like convenience store they
have in the hotel and see if they have any
candles."
Meanwhile, I'm sprinting down.
I'm grabbing a table.
I'm carrying a table.
People in the restaurant, like the outdoor
seating, are looking at me like what the heck
is this guy doing.
Carry the table out.
I get the linens.
I set it up.
I'm moving the lounge chairs.
This isn't a short process and so I finally
get back up to the hotel.
Which it had to have taken me ten minutes
to do all of this.
And I'm like how am I going to cover that
I just took ten minutes to get candles.
Again, I was in vacation bliss having a glass
of wine so I was just in heaven at that point.
Had no idea.
No idea.
Had no idea.
So then I'm thinking I gotta get down to the
beach.
How am I going to pack all of this stuff up
without her knowing.
So, I'm like, let's go sit out on the..on
the.. lanai.
The lanai.
And just, ya know, look at the ocean.
She's like, oh that sounds great.
So she's sitting out there.
I'm like, I'll just, I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna check on the food.
I'm like whipping out bags.
I'm stuffing stuff in.
I've got wine.
I've got a wine bottle opener.
I'm trying to stuff like this into some sort
of a transportable dish.
Plates.
Silverware.
Napkins.
It was crazy.
He even remembered the sunglasses.
And now, you can kinda see here.
See how the shrimp is just kinda starting
to get pink.
Now we are going to add in the magic sauce.
I've just got Alfredo.
This is the little secret.
This is just Alfredo out of a jar.
It's just Alfredo sauce.
I think this is a Bertolli Alfredo sauce.
so I'm just going to put that in.
We are going to add our shredded romano cheese.
Not the whole thing, just a good amount.
That looks about good.
And we're going to melt all of this together.
So, I'm stuffing this all in a bag and then
I finally go out to the beach... or the Lanai.
And I'm thinking she's gonna know now.
And I say, okay, let's go.
And she's like, let's eat out here.
And I said, we're not eating up here.
She still has no idea though.
I'm thinking she knows.
She doesn't know.
So we walk down to the beach.
I'm just going to add a little heavy cream
now to this.
Oh yeah.
About a quarter cup.
You guys this dish is so good you have no
idea.
I'm so excited.
I'm gonna mix all this stuff up.
So at that point, we've eaten dinner, we've
had some wine and I'm like this is it.
The sun is coming down.
I tell her, let's take a picture.
I'll put the self timer on and we'll take
a picture right?
Mmm hmm.
Unbeknownst to her, I'm setting up a video.
So she goes out and she's standing.
I started the video.
I walk out and it looked like we're about
to take a picture and then I turned to you
and I said, "We're not taking a picture".
Ohhh, it just gave me goose bumps.
Yeah, I, we don't remember what we said.
No.
No idea.
But we talked for a little while and then
I got down on my knee and I asked you if you
would spend the rest of your life with me.
And you said...
I said yes.
So that's the story of how we got engaged.
The moment she says yes and I stand up and
kiss, erupting from the restaurant.
Yep.
Are hoots and hollers and cheers and we're
like, what is going on?
It was pretty darn special.
Alright, so this is now in an awesome place.
I'm now going to start adding some of our
spices.
Now we really like spices so I'm going to
add quite a bit of cayenne here.
But we do cayenne and when I say quite a bit,
like you'll see, we like it, we like it spicy.
Cayenne, we're going to do a little black
pepper in there.
And then we're going to add just a little
salt to start and then we'll see how this
is tasting once we get this all mixed together.
Oh my gosh, it smells so familiar and yummy.
Okay, this smells amazing.
Let's check our pasta.
We're probably right where we need to be.
Now we just add this right in here.
Look at that.
Perfect fit.
Excellent.
We've got our pasta, you can see it is all
nicely mixed together here.
And the sauce it just going to thicken.
It's just going to thicken as time goes.
Alright, now we're going to plate this up.
So, we are just going to take a nice hefty
portion here.
I'm going to put it right on our plate.
Oh my gosh.
We're just going to sprinkle a little parsley
right on top.
Beautiful.
And there you have it.
You know what time it is?
I think it's time for a taste test.
Mmmm.
My favorite dish ever.
I was just going to say.
My favorite pasta dish of all time.
You have to try it, the cheese, the Alfredo
with the added romano cheese.
Mmm hmm.
And the added heavy cream.
The shrimp and vegetables are cooked perfectly.
And with the cayenne, just gives it that kick
that just tastes absolutely amazing.
Good job.
