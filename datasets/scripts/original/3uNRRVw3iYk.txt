Now I'm going to show you how to polish your
flute. First of all we'll start off with our
silver plate flute here. You can get this
silver polishing cloth at any you know, music
store, any jewelry store, that will work too.
You want to basically start, we want to start
with our little head joint, first and it is
really helpful if you do this after every
time you get done playing, to help kind of
keep it in between times, happen to get it
totally detailed. We'll start just gently
rub. You don't really want to use any abrasive
cleaner on here. Keep in mind your flute is
just plated, so you can work through the plating
of that flute. Start off cleaning that one
there. And now we'll go to the body, you want
to kind of do our keys first, and kind of
be real gentle, try to get in between if you
can. It's kind of hard, there's really tight
spaces. But when you're working this part
right in front of the paths, you want to be
real careful so you don't catch the fronts
of those. You can damage those, and they will
have to be replaced. Yeah, so you don't really
want to do that. And we'll go onto our foot
joint. Get that all cleaned off. There you
go. Now our nickel is a little bit different.
This is kind of not so forgiving, you can't
quite, there's might be some spots on it where
you just can't get it polished. And that is
completely normal. But with this one we're
going to start off with a little bit of Windex
here. And I'll start with our little head
joint. Wipe off all their fingerprints. And
I have a lacquer cloth right here. And the
silver cloth will work good too, but this
one is just made for that. Wipe that off,
and as you can see, the Windex did a pretty
good job in the first place with this flute,
but. And again, you really want to stay away
from the paths. But that is how to polish
your flutes.
