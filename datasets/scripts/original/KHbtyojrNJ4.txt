Hello friends and welcome to Dy TKA I'm
back with another summer special and
very popular Frozen Indian Desert known
as kulfi kulfi is similar to ice cream
but it's dense and has a creamy and
grainy texture it can be made in
numerous flavors like mango Malay and
quer Etc today we will make my favorite
kaju and Pista kulfi this recipe will
make a small kulies so let's get started
for kaju Pista kulfi we need half cup
evaporated milk half cup heavy whipping
cream three slices of bread 2 tbsp
pistachos 2 tbsp cashew 1 teaspoon
cardum powder and 3/4 cup or two taste
sweetened condensed milk firstly we will
remove brown edges of the bread
[Music]
cut it into
pieces grind it into fine
powder and transfer it into a
ball in the same jar now we will grind
pistachios and cashews together in on
and off mode we are not looking for fine
powder for kulfy we need coely grounded
nuts it's done now in a ball which I had
kept in freezer for 15 minutes already
pour whipping cream and beat it on
medium Med speed for 40 to 50
[Music]
seconds cream is beaten nicely now add
in condensed
[Music]
milk evaporated
milk cardamum
powder
breadcrumbs and coarsely grounded nuts
mix everything together with the help of
a
[Music]
spatula once again beat this mixture on
low speed for 15 to 20 seconds until
everything is combined
[Music]
well optionally you may add few drops of
green food color to give lovely light
green color to kulfy
all right this is also done now pour
kulfy mixture into kulfy molds and if
you don't have kulfy molds don't worry
you can even pour it into cups or small
glasses as I
did cover kulfi with silver foil or
cling wrap to avoid ice pistal formation
Place kulfi into freezer for 2 to 3
hours or until it sets up slightly so
that kulfy stick can be inserted
[Music]
it's been 2 hours and kulfy has started
to freeze slightly now insert stick in
middle of the mold and freeze it again
until it sets up
completely it's been 10 hours into
freezer and kulfy looks ready let's
unmold it now to unmold kulfi place it
into warm water for 4 to 5 seconds and
then remove it from mold gently
