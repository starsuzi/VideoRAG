hey guys welcome to the HD channel and
in this video I'll be showing you how to
discale your nest presso coffee machine
and in my case uh I've got a nest presso
latisa plus so if you own one of these
coffee machines you know what it's like
guys you turn the coffee machine on
light's flashing whilst it warms up and
then the orange light pops
up I don't know if you can see it there
cuz my light's quite bright but yeah
yeah the orange light pops up and you
think not again but don't worry when I
first got when I first got one of these
machines and the orange light popped up
I had to jump straight away onto uh the
website and get a the scaling pack but
you don't need to disar it straight away
I mean it won't as long as you do it
within a reasonable time and you don't
just leave
it uh it should be okay but you know
when you do you get a time or when it is
convenient you just grab yourself the
scaling pack I mean these coffee
machines are great I mean since I bought
this machine I've
not I've caught down on Starbucks so
much I used to like grab a Starbucks
every time I I pass one and I always get
urg sometimes just to pop out and get
grab a Starbucks but since owning this
machine I've had had any of those urges
at all to actually go out and grab a
Starbuck so after some use uh the orange
light does pop up there just means that
your machine does need the scaling to
keep it in optimal
condition so what I thought I do a video
to show you guys how it's done because
when you buy the scaling pack there are
actually no instructions in it uh I
think there are instructions in the the
the manual for the machine
but uh probably like me uh and quite a
lot of other people out there is once
they grab the machine they just throw
the instruction manual away or they
can't remember where they put it so I
thought I share this with you guys so
hopefully this video become useful so
this is an espresso dis sking
pack they come in uh a box like this and
there's two saet
inside so there's not much to it
really uh
English
so basically just saying that this SL
get build up your machine over time to
ensure your taste experience is perfect
as the first
day so yeah so come in a box like this
with two sashes inside I've actually
used this part before already but for
this I do it I share it you guys I do
this with one hand
now
okay so that's the so come the S like
this
so yeah will need to use the tripod do
this 100 100 but yeah it come like this
like it's like a liquid
inside so let's get
started on this particular model there's
a flap here so you
just pull that and a little nozzle comes
out this is for the scaling so when you
pop this into the machine it turns the
machine into the scaling mode so on this
machine there's like a little
door here flips
open this plus model it actually comes
with a a
milk uh a carton that plugs in here as
well but obviously it's not I'm not
using at the moment so that pops in like
so and uh the orange light is flashing
that's Cur are flashing which means that
it's in the skining
mode so you grab the water take out and
you need
to empty them water
first right so you get the water your
water tank out obviously empty any your
water so we've got an empty water tank
so what you need to do is fill it up
with uh 500 mL or one or half a liter of
water
so
up right so the mix for the SC the
scaling uh solution is 500 mil which is
half a
liter fill that in
there try not to get
everywhere why did I make make it like
that why is it leaking let me try
again right let's try again
so
try to do this
carefully
so in right okay so just do it slowly
not caveman
style right so it doesn't go
everywhere boom no a drop wasted
okay right so we got half a liter water
in there so you get yourself
[Applause]
s why is it
that hopefully this isn't go
everywhere it's like a nice
cool light blue ice
color actually lot
antifreeze
okay so just just pop the water to back
in right that's
in okay so you need something to catch
the water so I've got
this cuz it needs to that's not staying
there so let's get B
here pull it
in okay let try fo
Pall great okay so I've kind of balance
that on Wedge that on there cuz
basically you need something a container
that holds it says at least one liter I
can't see I don't know why need one ler
but anyway there's plenty of space to
play with there uh the container needs
to be the container needs to cover the
two nozzles here because the water when
it is descaling it uses both of them
alternatively
all right so got contain here to catch
the
water and this is where the magic
happens you press the disc scale button
so three two one let's do
[Music]
it it's actually quite
noisy
that's
so that's choking away
there as you can see the lights are
flashing alternatively at the top
quite surprised the water comes up it's
just like Clear
Water hope I not missed it
wrong oh is do oh it should be
done
waiting while waiting for this this
machine to the scale uh you see here
some of the capsules that I usually
drink they the more well except for
these two at the bottom there I've got
two decaps left from
a from a a multi pack that I bought uh
Nobody Drinks the CF so we've actually
got through quite a lot of decafs cuz
they did come in quite a big box uh only
two left now but at the moment uh yeah
these are the ones
that that we're drinking
regularly for Americano usually I drink
these ones this is the new uh lungo one
which is is quite nice it just
uh T actually tastes like uh a Hong Kong
style uh CH uh Hong Kong actually tastes
like a Hong Kong style coffee and tea
mixture so it's quite intense quite
strong apparently it's supposed to be
like for breakfast breakfast Brew but I
drink
it all through days and
times also we got the variations here as
well which is like popular with
everyone especially when it gets hot
they make great iced
coffees
so these capsules here is for easy
access the more popular ones you just
grab it and just put pop in the machine
then I've got another coffee wall with
uh more different
capsules
after we have seen some uh third party
descaling uh packs as well that are
compatible with espresso coffee machines
as well but I've actually gone down that
route because I mean they're not that
expensive the the skin pack so I don't
want to like skip on um on a few quid
and jeopardized by Machine
really
so this video is a real
time descaling
video so this is the real time the exact
time
it takes the scale on this presso
machine
can't imine if I didn't use his balls to
prop his ball up my will be aching
holding that just wait to catch
water I have uh read online as well some
people have actually said that they've
not bought the skinny packs but just to
turn off the orange light the annoying
orange light here that tells you that
the machine is the scaling what some
people have done have actually theyve
just uh open the flap taken this nozzle
out put the machine in the skinny mode
and just fill the T water and uh dis
scale it that way and press the orange
button and disal that way but I wouldn't
recommend that because obviously the
machine is telling you that in is the
scaling for a reason cuz obviously it's
a fil up a lime scale so I mean if you
do it that way it does turn the light
off but your
machine but your machine is building up
L
scale and uh in Long Turn could damage
your
machine so I won't recommend just doing
that just to turn light off if anything
just just leave it just ignore the
orange light until you can actually get
around to get the skinning kit to
actually the skill machine
properly
is
for
look carefully he can actually see the
water's got a a tinge of uh of
Blue from the from the scaling
solution
all right just got to the end of the
cycle now so the water stops
flowing uh you can see that's the liquid
in the in the bowl in the dish
here that's collected from the water
tank so that's actually passed through
the coffee machine and cleaned the
machine so that's all done now so I just
tip this away quite be careful cuz the
water is quite hot so I take that away
so what you need to do now obviously we
just passed the solution through the
machine so now you get the water tank
again out again what you do you you fill
it up to the max level like on this one
uh the max
level with water just to just to rinse
the the the coffee machine
out so we're almost done
now so uh
just just rinse the container out as
well because I don't want to really be
drinking
any es scaling solution in my
[Music]
coffee
all right so that's a
Max so just pop this in into the back of
the
machine all right so the water tunks in
so just again press the orange disal
button now
again
all right okay and now it's rinsing it
now it's rinsing it it's actually the
flow's actually much more
faster this time
around so before with this this get
solution is actually choking along now
it's actually quite free flowing
actually now now went rinsing machine
out see this time lights
the flash lights flashing alternative
laser on the
[Music]
top
[Music]
I'm actually not sure how many I think
it does depend on your water your water
if it's soft or high water as well and
to adjust the machine accordingly as
well but I'm not adjusting my machine to
be honest and
uh I've actually gone through quite a
few these skiving kits
already so it's either I'm not
set my machine to the water properly yet
or we just been basically drinking two
loads of
coffee cuz every time when I go to this
pretel shop and buy some capsules there
was actually we like a couple coffee and
my most of the time unless it's like a
new flavor that I've not tried before
and I want to sample a new flavor my
most of the time usually is no no
thans I drink too much coffee at home
already
so you can see there there actually
quite
milky the water that's rining that's
coming out of the machine
now going touch that on camera just very
slightly
all right so we com to the end of the
rinsing okay so that's it your
npro machine has been scale and it's
ready for action so let me just so all
you need to do is obviously get rid of
the
water
water put this away uh the nozzle just
comes
out just get a quick rinse so can rinse
it later and open the flap that pops
back in again so you because you've
taken out the nozzle it's got back into
a normal coffee mode now so that
that's back and now we're ready for
action so just grab yourself a capsule
and you're ready to
go so
uh this is this is a dising kit you can
actually you can buy them online and
also uh on at your local espresso
Boutique as
well uh I'll put the price on the
description below I can't remember how
much it was as off top of my head I
think it was about7 I think but um I I
double check that and put the put the
exact price in the in the description
