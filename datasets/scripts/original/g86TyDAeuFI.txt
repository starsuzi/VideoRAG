Hello and welcome to Neeta in kitchen.
Today we will make Dry mint powder.
It is very useful in summers and we added to
buttermilk, mango panna etc. to enhance its taste
Let us look at the ingredients
we require to make dry mint powder.
First of all we will take a bunch of mint leaves
Now separate the leaves of the mint from the bunch
and take it out in a bowl.
Here we have taken 150 grams of mint leaves.
Now we have separated the leaves from the bunch.
Now we will microwave these mint leaves
for five minutes at 80% power
and we will stir it twice while doing so.
Now spread the mint leaves nicely
so that it will dry properly.
If you do not have a microwave at home
spread the mint leaves in a flat vessel
& dry it in sunlight light for 3-4 days.
after drying it for three to four days in sunlight
you can grind it and store it in a powdered form.
Five minutes are completed
Now we will give it a 10 minute standing time
after giving it 10 minutes
standing time.
We will observe that the mint leaves are absolutely dry.
Now take out the mint leaves in a bowl.
Just grind these dried mint leaves in a grinder
to get the dry mint powder.
Store it in an airtight container & use it as per required.
Please try making mint powder at home
and share your experience with me.
