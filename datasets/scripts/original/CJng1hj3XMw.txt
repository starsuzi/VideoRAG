I'm going to show you how to make a
basic Roman shade like this and the one
thing that's a little different than
what you've probably seen before in
roman shades is this has the encased
lift cord shroud tape now the Shroud
tape has a cord inside that runs up and
it can come out and into your lift
system and this is the easy rig shade
system and you actually sew this tape
onto the shade instead of sewing on
rings and the purpose of this tape is to
prevent the cord from being pulled out
and away from the shade creating a loop
so this is a great style to do in homes
with Children what you'll need to make
your shade you'll need to pick out a
pretty face
fabric if you want to use lining you can
add lining to your shade
you will need a board to Mount Your
shade to staple it to on top you need a
weight bar and you want to cut that one
inch less than what your board is or the
finished width of your
shade you'll need some sew on rings and
these are plastic Rings you also could
use metal rings you only need a few of
these then you need the encase lift cord
shroud
tape it comes in two sizes of cord this
is the 1.4 mm cord which is what I'm
going to use because we're mounting on
the easy rig shade system we also sell
it in .9 mm if you're using the soft
shade traversing
clutch and then you'll need basic sewing
supplies scissors needles thread and a
ruler so to start you're going to cut
your face fabric 8 in longer than your
finished
length and you're going to cut it 8 in
wider than your finish
length on your face fabric you want to
turn in hems on each side I'll set the
lining aside for right
now and you can press those in with an
iron these have already been pressed so
they fold right
in and then on the other side and you do
want to measure it to make sure that
there's no take up when you turn the
fabric over but you should end up with a
side hem that's about 2 in
down each
side on the bottom I'm going to turn
up again 4 in and then turn that in to
create a 2in Hemm across the bottom you
want to do the bottom last because
that's where we're going to insert the
weight bar if I did it first you
wouldn't be able to get the weight bar
in
there so now that's ready for the
lining this is a dim outlining you can
use a Satine or a blackout
and that's been been cut the finished
length I mean excuse me the finished
width plus the finished length and add 4
in so it should end up about even with
your face
Fabric and smooth that out and then
we're going to tuck that under the side
hems and under the bottom
hem now you can finish off the hems
however you would like you you can
machine sew them hand sew them or use an
ironon bonding tape or an ironon
adhesive but for now I'm just going to
pin the hems in
place and you want to put the hems in
before you add the Shroud
tape you also if you're doing a wide
shade you'll want to add some pin within
the body of the shade now this is a
little small
sample but that'll help to keep the face
Fabric and the lining
together let's add a few pens down here
so if you want to you can add a few pens
all the way through catching the face
fabric right down the middle that way
when you move it around on the table it
won't
separate so now it's ready to have the
side hems and the bottom hem done just
don't finish off both ends as you sew
around this bottom botom him leave one
end
open and I have one finished
underneath so leave one end open because
that's where the weight bar is going to
go and you need to have a good weight
bar in the
bottom to help the um shade system
operate better having a little tension
and weight helps the clutch work better
so that's in the bottom and then you'll
close up that end as well so the bar
won't fall
out now we're ready to add the Shroud
tape you want to allow enough shroud
tape to go from the bottom the top of
your hem all the way to the top of the
shade plus whatever you need at the top
for whatever lift system you're using
for the easy rig shade system I probably
want to add about 6 in extra and then
cut it off because it's going right up
into the system and wrapping around the
drums but if you're doing a cord lock
and uh screw eyes or pulley you will
have to come up with your shroud tape
come over and then come back down
however far you
need before you put your cord condenser
and we do have a video about this on the
website but for the easy rig shade
system I'm going to allow about 6 or 8
in cut that
off and I'm going to need three pie
pieces for this shade you want the shr
tape to be spaced about 9 in or less
apart if you're making a plain shade
like this you'll want them closer
together if you're making a shade that
has stitched folds or ribs within the
shade you might be able to space it out
a little bit more but a flat shade you
need to have
it closer together better to have too
many rows than not
enough so there's the three rows the
first row I'm going to center of the
cord and you can see the cord that's
inside the Shroud tape so the center of
the Shroud tape is going over the edge
of the side
hem and I do that on both
sides and then find the
center and Center this tape all the way
up the
shade that's in place I'm going to stab
some pin so it doesn't move
around then at the bottom you have to
have something for the cord to tie off
on so we're going to sew shade rings
on so that's why we had these little
plastic shade rings so I need one for
the bottom of each
row and at the bottom of the Shroud tape
about 3 inches from the bottom I'm going
to pull out the cord I'm going to fish
it out using a
pin and then trim off the tape leaving
about an
inch and that's going to get turned
under tucked under so there's no raw
edges and if you pre-plan this you
actually can put it into your hem and
Stitch across it so that's going to end
right there I'm going to go ahead and
put a pin hold that in
place and this is where I'm going to sew
ring so the cord is actually going to go
through the ring and that'll get sewn
right here to the shade so I have a
needle
already put a knot in the
end and sew this ring
on so you're going to repeat this for
all rows or Columns of your shroud
tape you try not to catch the cord
itself let me pull that out of the way
you also want to stitch the tape down as
well so that it doesn't Fray on the
bottom you could also glue this in place
I'm just going to add a couple
stitches then go through to the other
side and Stitch the other side down I'm
not going through to the face I'm just
catching the tape to hold it in place at
the bottom of the
shade and make a knot
and you want to do that for the other
rows I'm going to leave this undone for
now because I want to be able to adjust
the length of the shade and it's nice to
have some loose cord but it's probably a
good idea just to pin it in
place just in case you forget you pick
it up or you pull on it you don't want
to pull it out of this casing because
then you'd have to thread it back in or
get a whole new piece so I'm just
pinning that in place for right now you
want to tack the shr tap to the shade
I'm going to do that at every 6 in so
I'm going to measure up 6 in place a
pen place a pen all the way up to the
Top If you have a couple of
rulers you can put them across the whole
shade and Mark it all at
once and then pin through the Shroud
tape now this will allow me to take it
off the table if I wanted to go and
Stitch this maybe um sitting at the
television
watching a
movie and you don't want to get too
close to the top the last tack Point can
be about 6 to 12 in from the top of your
shade so that's one row on I'm going to
repeat the same process for each row of
the Shroud tape and to sew it
on you're going to stitch all the way
through to the front because you need
the stitches to catch the fabric at the
front to pull up those Folds
so I'm going to start on one side I'm
going to start underneath so my knot
doesn't show and I'm just whoops my knot
came out there we go I'm just going to
stitch on the side the left and the
right remember that cord is in the
middle we don't want to catch the cord
because that's going to travel up to
lift the shade and I'm stitching all the
way through to the
front so that's
one and make a little Stitch for a knot
and then you can pass the needle under
and come out on the other side and it's
not going through this time it's just
hiding behind the tape or you can start
a new piece of thread which I think I
need to do because this is a little
short piece of
thread and Stitch the other side so
you're going to do that all the way up
at all of those 6 inch
marks and you'll want to do that on each
column of tape
so I'll put a knot in and finish this
one so you can see how that looks you
are going to have these little tack
points coming through to the front of
your shade so you want to use a matching
thread and you can feel with your hand
the needle coming through to the back
side so I'm putting in a
knot so that's how that's going to be
done
at each tack point at each pen on each
row of the Shroud
tape when the cord comes up through the
Shroud tape see there's the ring at the
bottom it's a little hard to see because
it's white on
white the cord comes up and into the
lift system so it's really a simple way
to do it once you get the tape Zone on
all your cord is already in place so be
sure to look at our other videos on how
to put your shade on the easy briak shad
system and how to assemble the easy rig
shade system to make Roman shades
