you do have to pull the benefited yak to
get the edge of the roots all you have
edges clean
Nomi you're not going to get a vertical
surface clean
a little bit of an angle you found that
anything above 8 gallons a minute
oh forget yet
meaning below Mandan gonna want
everything edge with
the majority of the pol unit
end up having
like you
different geographic areas
you're not going to do this in Ohio or
or anywhere where you don't have this
kind of mo bro how have you there
obviously proving tropical environment
you know
another
I mean there is an airport II each of us
support lotto exactly of it may have to
do with aviation fuel exhaust whatever
yeah
shut up
Oh
like eight pounds away
you have a new frock sure we can have
now available than a half inch longer
by having the right claritin and neither
clearance on the gray bar you know
that'll give you a benefit on that
you can see why I want another tension
maybe something could be added another
two for longer that way they can stay
away from the edge of the roof you see
him getting down the edge you'll be the
relatively close I mean not terrible
yeah
yeah
come where people come off falling off a
roof that they knew the rate for profit
just taking a risk
matter may be it so like right now we're
on a good group mildew or mildew on it
there's another root coating it's like a
rubberized
that mildew and wet it's like an
ice-skating rink out there is extremely
dangerous someone isn't prepared and
know that in this van who comes out to
you the wrong cleaning solution
that could be another issue for people
that are doing we can see his empire
through the paving the way they're
knocking this thing out and how
professional they are you know
a day if you grab one a million not the
gun situation for you
all the newbie they never get up here or
anything kill themselves trying to do it
including me
though
happy I don't do this day in and day out
like I said our training instructor I
kind of went out there's a good program
at matter fact a lot of his training
trainee he owned it on business and
ended up selling it emergency nothing
really emerging in this went to work for
be because it does so much work lined up
and he's right now good they have
something that knows what they're doing
see what you need the clearance and all
that
