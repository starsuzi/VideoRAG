what's up everybody gmax here um I went
out and got me I was actually looking
for a a gas flap actuator and I came
across the sky with a parting out a 04
Maxima uh went up to see him had a
couple of Parts bought off of him and
wanted one of them was the headlights I
know these headlights are pretty
freaking expensive it even came with the
ballast and hid bults everything
connected to it so I didn't even
hesitate to take it off of him these
things are going to come in handy for me
so what I'm going to do with it is
modified I'm going to open it up as my
older videos and try to see if I could
customize like a ring or something even
like a LED strip inside of here so y
y'all want to stick around for that um
that video um as far as this one this
one is pretty pretty badly haed and I'm
going to show youall a really simple and
effective way to clean that up what I
have found is um this
product I guess it's a Canadian company
cuz you could see all the Canadian stuff
on it it's probably the
easiest stress hasslefree way to clean
your headlights it works I just tried it
um one day and it worked really really
well I got it from uh car shows if
anytime you see this product you should
probably pick it up for about $10 $15
don't pay any more than $20 for it in a
single can they usually sell them at car
shows or you know your auto stores or
whatever but look for this product this
product is a very good product so all
you need is your orbital
sander and this oh yes and a a cloth you
need need you definitely need a clo um
I'm going to show you all how easy it is
so I'll buff one of them and compare it
to the other side if I find it's a
little bit too scratched up as you can
see that there's a lot of scratches on
the lens what I would do is take like a,
1500 grit sandpaper water sand it out
and then use your your um buffer so I'm
going to show you all how easy it works
see
so for the first one you just want to
buff that up first then you wipe it
down what are you doing oh hey using
to keep an eye on my spicy
buffalo see one application and already
starting to look
pretty pretty clean
with basic phone service you can make
unlimited Crystal CLE domestic calls for
just $9.99 a month every month but if
you don't believe me listen to this
Englishman the British accent quite
right basic talk just 9.99 a month call
click or go to Walmart today I've always
seen no no on TV and I
right so we have a side by side
comparison you don't just want to know
there's an alarm you want to see what's
unlike traditionality
systems so as you can see the major
[Music]
difference
simple way to not pay somebody to do
something you can do yourself
cut it side by
side that's just two
applications I didn't have to use no
water no sandpaper
nothing if you see the
difference that's some two
applications this is going to last you a
really really long
time so I got those two
headlights cleaned up as you can see it
looks pretty brand new right now that's
just with
two two
buffings I'm pretty sure if I went a
little more I would get a really really
really brighter shine but again this
product is fw1 it's pretty good easiest
way to clean your
headlights if your Haze is you know
really really bad you might want to
start with a a 1500 grit water sand down
and then use
your the wax cleaning wax but again this
is the finished product
