hey guys welcome to my shower and
welcome to best hot mess the only show
where we try things that we find on the
internet so you don't have to why are we
in the shower because I'm about to put
beer in my hair now the whole point of
this is it apparently deep cleans we've
we're going to try two different beers
we're going to try regular person beer
and then we're going to try Fancy Pants
beer uh expensive IPA versus good old
Coors Light tall booy I have a lot of
hair so we have a lot of beer um and I'm
going to do it on half and half so I'm
going to
start IPA on this side
[Music]
ew I hate beer I hate this
smell I am not enjoying myself I smell
like a pukey college
boy all right so now we're going to try
Coors Light
[Music]
[Music]
oh my God it's in my
eyes I have beer in my
eyes oh
no ow who knew that that stuned so much
I can't
see the things I do for science
[Music]
[Music]
all right so I have my beer in my hair
I'm
soaked I'm I'm soaked in beer um Coors
Light on this side so remember righty
Lighty righty Lighty Lefty IPA I don't
know I'm going to wash this out I smell
like a drunken Frapp Bo I we will be
right
[Music]
back oh man I do not recommend showering
with your eye makeup
on so we're going to ignore the fact
that my makeup is a mess and that the
entire bathroom smells like a teenagers
broke into my apartment and had a party
we're going to see how my hair looks
this supposedly makes your hair um uh
more manageable I think
conditioned um and I remember as a kid
like the old wives tail that it gave
your hair more body but I don't know
let's see if it worked so I've towel
dried my hair for like 2 minutes um and
I'm just going to dry it as I normally
would I'll use a little bit of product
but um not a ton and we'll see what
happens so let's go
um
so definitely
still has a slight beard smell to it but
not terrible I if you guys were here for
the mayonnaise not nearly as bad as that
that was disgusting all right
now now the fun part
so there we go there's the IPA side um
it's pretty much dry so I'm going to
stop here um I have nothing bad to say
about this it dried really easily it
kind of dried straighter than it
normally did which I'm not at all mad
about because that's a big pain point
for me um I think it looks I think it
looks good again doesn't smell this one
smells a little more beer but maybe
because I've left it a little bit damp
but as far as this is concerned I've
tried other things where you put food
products in your hair and they feel
gross and different and this my hair
feels pretty good it feels well
conditioned I'm surprised to say that
this was for both
cases the best definitely give it a shot
if you guys need a better conditioned
hair this is like a cheap and easy way
um this one especially and I have
nothing bad to say here this is a little
bit more expensive but I guess if you if
your boyfriend husband uh friend drinks
these and they give you one and you
don't feel like drinking it yourself I
would say just like pour it over your
head I mean give it a shot
