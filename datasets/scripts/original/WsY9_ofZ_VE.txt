thank you for purchasing a Benny Barker
bow
tie depending on the collar you will use
with it the bow tie may fit a little
loose this video will demonstrate our
solution each bow tie includes a velcro
strip the velcro strip will be located
behind the bow
tie detach the velcro strip from behind
the bow
tie grab and unhook the collar you will
be
using place the edge of the strip
perpendicular to the
collar and begin to tightly wrap the
velcro strip around the
collar we recommend to wrap the velcro
with the soft side on the outside
once the velcro strip is all wrapped
around place the collar through the Loop
behind the bow
tie if the velcro strip is too thick to
fit through the
loop you will need to trim off off a
piece of the velcro
strip unwrap a small portion of the
strip from the
collar and cut a piece of the strip off
as
needed do this until you're able to fit
the bow tie Loop over the
collar this should give your bow tie a
snug fit on the
collar and keep your bow tie stable in
one place on the
collar we hope hope our demonstration
was
