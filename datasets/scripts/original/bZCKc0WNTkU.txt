day two of the egg experiment
this is the raw egg that we put into
some more vinegar two days ago
and we're just gonna see if the shell
has completely dissolved what do you
think max
what does it feel like it feel really
soft
yep oh it does right pop it on there now
you're supposed to be able to bounce
these aren't you
yeah so go on see if it bounces
oh wow it does go do that again
oh my goodness i'm gonna go max it's
bouncing egg
yay catch it quick
blooming that that's like a rubber ball
so that means that you can take
a raw egg and make it bounce
how cool is that oh
should we chop it in half and see what's
inside
i want to careful with the knife because
it's a very sharp knife just
chopping off because it's all it's
coagulated on the outside
bridge make a bridge
oh and then on the inside it's a proper
egg
but then the part of it that was
touching
the um vinegar has coagulated
we've got egg skin cool
let's have a look at the hard boiled one
this was the one we hard boiled
and this left a little bit of the shell
sticking out the top so that is that's
hard isn't it still hard
and there's a ridge around there
where the um
the egg's been inside otherwise it's
soft chop that one in half so that one's
like
that should be i'll go and see if it
bounces first
does that bounce as well does it bounce
as well as the raw one
no it doesn't it kind of thuds doesn't
it so raw egg
makes the best bouncy balls bridge
is it hard to cut
let's have a look inside
oh a perfect pickled hard-boiled egg
that might taste really yummy in a
sandwich
so what do we think of that then max is
that cool yup yup
