hello i'm john from rescue paint bars
and today i'm going to be making you one
of our little twists my classic cocktail
which is the amaretto sour
now a sour is a member of a broader
family of cocktails called the sours
and a salad normally consists of a
spirit or a liqueur with fresh lemon
sugar syrup possibly a dash of angostura
bitters and maybe a little bit of egg
white but for texture we're not going to
bother with the bitters or the egg white
what we're going to do is just a
straight amaretto sour with a little
hint of cherry
and the cherry we're going to use a
chevy jam and a little dash of cherry
syrup in there as well instead of any
sugar content so
we're going to start off with our boston
glass we're going to shake it and strain
it
and we're going to go for
a nice spoonful
of our cherry jam they might sound a bit
weird using a jam in a cocktail but at
the end of the day it's it's the essence
of the fruit with a little tiny bit of
sugar and a little bit of acidity in
there
it's a great way of getting flavour into
the drink without adding that much
volume to it there's a brilliant drink
by um saboteur calabrese called the
breakfast martini which is gin cointreau
lemon and uh
marmalade and it's awesome it garnishes
with a lot of tiny pieces of toast as
well which is quite quite cool trust me
anyway so we've got the sweetness of the
cherry going in there then we're going
to go in with
three quarters of an ounce of fresh
lemon juice
so that's that in there
now we're not having any other alcohol
content apart from the amaretto so we're
going to go in with a full ounce of
three-quarters or 50ml if if you prefer
thinking the continental way so
yeah
now in a traditional sour you'd have at
least
10 ml of sugar syrup in there just to uh
to sweeten it up but what we're going to
do because of the sweetness of the
amaretto we're going to have slightly
less of that and we're just going to use
a little cherry syrup just to again
bring out the flavour that tiny bit more
so we've got the amaretto we've got the
lemon we've got the cherry
whacking a bit of ice
and shake the hell out of it
there we go tin's nice and cold glasses
mixed
ah there we go so get a straw
right to the bottom finger over the end
and a quick taste
it's really good
it's like a
sort of a cherry
marzipani bakewell tart sort of a drink
really good you're gonna try a drink for
your christmas parties
this is definitely up there on the list
the ones you should give it well too
so
i support glass
if you've got easy access to crushed ice
pack a bit of crushed ice in there why
not
uh i just need my
hawthorne strainer
which is going to be winging its way
into
shots and then we're just going to pour
it straight through there see look at
the color of that beautiful rich cherry
color
fantastic cocktail
a couple of straws
and just a dead simple lemon wedge to
garnish if you've got some fresh
cherries wall up one of those in there
as well why not
could use some maraschino cherry but if
you ask me
it's pretty much poisonous sticking one
of those in it
there you go fantastic cherry amaretto
enjoy
