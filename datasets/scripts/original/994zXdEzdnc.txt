hi guys what's up its your boy ants
Canada here
welcome to the ants Canada and Channel I
just wanted to share this special video
with all of you guys because one we're
launching a new product called the n's
Canada habitat nest it's our latest
version and it is so awesome and it's
currently our best designer for material
and as well I have a new mature colony
that came into my possession and I
wanted to document how I move and
already mature colony into one of our
hypothetical tetanus has a band of
whatever repellent you're using whether
it be baby powder mixed with rubbing
alcohol which I find works here in the
Philippines Vaseline doesn't keep ants
in the basin and it doesn't keep them in
the unit so you can use baby powder and
alcohol which seems to work really well
or you can use PTFE also known as flu on
also known as insect the slip which you
can purchase from a website called bio
clip with a paintbrush I simply neatly
painted it along the top so there's at
least a one and a half inch one inch
thick band only the tops of the can't
escape I mean I did that both for the
habitat nest and the up world to
introduce to you the habitat nest can
have a look at it here this is the new
version of habitat nest
take a look at that awesome right
basically it's a unit with an
underground part can't get any more
natural than that and we feel like this
new ant colony is gonna love the new
space of course here's the habitat out
world right there
really naturalistic redesigned connected
through tubing which connects to there
now there are two ways to hydrate this
habitat nest you can either manually
soak the surface of this ground area
here and then it'll make its way down
into
chambers or there's a hole in the back
where you can actually fill with water
and it will hydrate the nest that way
very revolutionary and that'll be
available at the store very soon
makes a great Christmas gift so what I'm
gonna do first is I'm gonna cover this
habitat nest like so so it's dark and
then I'm going to uncover the nest now
here's the challenging part the fun part
having to disconnect a very active
colony from their already familiar space
so what I'm going to do is I need to
detach this from here and attach this
tube to the tube which attaches to the
habitat most I'm always a little nervous
at this stage of the game because you
gotta act quickly because these ants are
fast make sure all my connecting tubing
is ready ready to connect now
I'm gonna want to have continent on hand
to block the entrance where I unplug I'm
gonna have two pieces of cotton and you
got to be quick to that's the thing two
pieces of cotton ready one two block the
tube and then to block the entrance I'm
gonna block the entrance first now this
species of ant is solid OPS's Germanotta
so they do sting I'm not looking forward
to this okay here we go
unplugging happening now and you want to
do this when they're in an inactive
state right because these are tropical
ants I can't exactly kill them which
causes them to be slower sometimes you
know if you're from North America you
can do that you can stick the ants in
the fridge for a bit but because these
are tropical ants I can't do that build
a there's so many they're ready to
expand okay blocked block go go go go
okay we have two escapees and a bunch of
ants biting my thumb
they're all over my hand so got that
okay you can place any ants into the
unit
just flick them in into the habitat nest
the open habitat nest okay so we've got
ends of escaping here so now what I'm
going to do is attach this tube to the
two which leads into the the nest here
oh boy it's escaping out and they're
biting me oh oh
hurting whew ouch
out out out turn
he's bite hard okay
