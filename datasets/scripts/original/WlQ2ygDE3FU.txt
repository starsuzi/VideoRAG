We’re Adam and Joanne from inspiredtaste.net
and welcome to our kitchen!
We’re making Moscow Mules - one of our favorite
cocktails!
It’s hard to believe, but you only need
three ingredients for this - vodka, ginger beer and lime.
Simple and so delicious!
Fresh lime is a must in Moscow Mules, and
lots of it — we use half of a lime in each drink.
Squeeze the lime into a tall glass - or copper
mug - then drop the it into the bottom of the glass.
Fill the glass with ice then add vodka.
Now grab your favorite ginger beer and fill to the top of the glass.
And that’s it. We told you it was easy!!
Enjoy!
Thanks for watching!
