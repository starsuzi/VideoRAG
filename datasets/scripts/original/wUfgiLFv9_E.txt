Hi I'm Johnny from Gianni's NY Pizza
And today we're gonna talk about something
really simple that
You can find in almost every pizzeria in the
country.
Especially in a New York style pizzeria
And that is the infamous garlic knots.
Now the question is, "What makes our garlic
knots different from everyone else's garlic
knots?"
First off, it all starts in the dough.
The way you ferment the dough is going to
cause an explosion flavor within the dough
itself.
Once we let our dough rise, and they come
to a certain growth,
We put them inside the oven and
The finished product looks like this.
We have a golden brown fluffy garlic knot
It shouldn't be too heavy, it shouldn't
be too doughy,
But it should be nice soft crispy on the outside
and moist on the inside.
Like you can see the steam coming off of this
one here.
Once we do that we get our garlic knots here
and we use
Real olive oil, real fresh garlic, along with
some of our
Proprietary spices that we always use,
We're going to gently place them on top
of the garlic knots here,
We like to dose them on the garlic knots so
we make sure we get a good amount of quality
of fresh garlic and oil.
And then we finish it with real Romano parmesan
cheese and oregano.
And that's what makes our garlic knots so
delicious.
Uhmm.
