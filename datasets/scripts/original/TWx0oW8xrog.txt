there this is the watermelon wine about
uh 15 hours after we pitched the yeast
uh it's fermenting pretty hard it looks
like going to
town so we'll update you in another day
or
two this is the watermelon wine about 40
hours after we pitched the
yeast starting to slow down a little bit
but still fermenting
away okay guys so as you can see the uh
airlock has stopped on the watermelon
wine so we're going to go ahead and
crack that open and there's a look at
it uh primary is done fermenting so
we're going to go ahead and transfer
that now down into a
secondary Okay so we've got our
sanitized Carboy which is going to be
our secondary our sanitized uh siphoning
hose we stick that down the inside there
and we'll give this a couple
pumps and away she goes and that's going
to transfer from there down into
there so uh we'll take a look at it once
it's uh finished
transferring okay and there it is as
it's racking into the car boy um the
foam coming out of the top is just
sanitizer that's normal uh
so we'll stop it when it fills
up okay and here it is all uh rocked up
into the carboy we've got the uh
sanitized air lock and bung on it uh as
you can notice we filled it up just to
the bottom of the neck this is just
sanitizer in here it'll dissipate after
a little while um now we want to keep
oxygen out of it at this point so we'll
go ahead and leave this in here for
about a month and then we'll rerack it
to another car booy um it should start
toan or some and that's about it for the
next month here is a look in the
bucket at all the leaves on the bottom
of the bucket that's left
behind all that
Gunk and now we're left with uh 6 Gall
of uh fermented
must so here we have the uh watermelon
wine um as you can see it's still got a
pretty good color it's uh not clear
yet but it's been sitting in here for a
little over 2 months
now and as you can see once we get to
the bottom you can see all that sediment
at the bottom so we need to Rack it off
of that sediment so we don't get any off
flavors so uh we'll show you how to do
that okay so first off we've got our uh
clean jug here we're going to go ahead
and put some uh star sand in
there dump that down in
there and then we'll fill that up with
the cool
water we'll fill that up with cool water
as you can see It'll Suds up and uh
we'll get this all
sanitized okay and then once we've got
it all full of sanitizer I go ahead and
uh take my racking cane and uh rack the
sanitizer down into a bucket so we can
uh San anything else that we need to
sanitize and also that way our racking
cane will be all sanitized and ready for
the transfer okay so once you've got
your uh jug sanitized and your siphoning
tube sanitized you'll just uh bring your
jug over set it on the ground slide your
siphoning tube down in and uh pop off
your air
lock and we'll stick that down in there
and we'll give it a couple of
pumps to start it
and that'll start siphoning down into
the other jug you want to be careful not
to disturb the sediment at the bottom
we'll uh go ahead and rack this off as
much as we can into there and then we'll
be
back just uh kind of a tip for you guys
I uh stack a couple things and put them
up underneath there to kind of tilt the
uh jug and then uh I will put my siphon
to this side of the jug so we can get as
much liquid as we can um if you can see
that it's uh leaning this
way just kind of a tip for you
guys as you can see uh racking it it uh
looks fairly clear you can uh pretty
much see through the tube there so it's
looking uh fairly
clear it's getting there
as you're uh racking it over as you can
see the star Sand's coming out of the
top of the jug it's uh continuing to
sanitize as it's pushing up which is a
good thing this is normal just uh
letting you guys know that okay and then
uh here's kind of the gunk that you're
left with in the bottom of the jug we
will uh see if we can see through the
top
here that's uh kind of what you're left
with in the bottom of the jug
and
uh here is the new jug all filled
up okay so now we have it all rocked
over and uh we've got an air lock on top
we will just let it age
