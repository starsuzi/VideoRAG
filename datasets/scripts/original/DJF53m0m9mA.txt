so first you're going to make this cute
little tube start by getting an old
pringles container wrapping paper of
your choice pet safe glue and a pen or
pencil so first you're going to mark out
um where you want to cut your tube
and if you're using a paper tube then
you won't have to worry about this and
then you cut that out
next you're going to wrap that in
wrapping paper cut that out and then
glue that down and make sure to press
really hard so that'll stick and this is
so cute but so simple for the next one
we're going to make a cute little burrow
hold so first you're going to need
toilet paper a toilet paper tube and
seeds
cut out little fringes
and
just you know just do what i'm doing
then fold it over on the other side put
in shredded up toilet paper and a lot of
seeds
and then make little fringes and then
fold that over as well this is so cute
but you have to make sure because it
drops seeds a lot
next you're going to make this cute
little hanging toy that you can hang
your hamster's cage it's so cute so
you're going to need a paper tube
a pet safe um string
cardboard and a pen so first you start
by tracing out a toilet paper tube onto
cardboard make i made 18 so
and then you cut all of these out and
this might take a while and your hand
might crank up but it's totally worth it
because this is adorable
once you've done that to all of them you
make a little hole right in the middle
and then take put that out with a
sticker
and you may want to make sure that the
twine can go through it
and then once you've done that to all of
them you just thread the twine on these
and
you may see that this is kind of like a
monotonous but this is so much fun
and then you just tie the end
and this is like literally all that you
have to do this is so
cute
for the last one we're going to make a
cute little i don't know what you call
this but
you're going to need a tube
or cardboard
treats
and a pen
so first start by marking where you want
your
how long you want your cardboard to be
and then once you cut this out then you
make it into like a little zigzag
pattern this is absolutely really fun to
do but it kind of gives you paper cut so
watch out
once you've done that then you just
stick this inside your tube and then let
it go
and you can make more of these if you
want to fill it up and then making tiny
little ones stick those in to fill in
the gaps
and then you just put in little seeds
and stuff in the little gaps
so yeah guys thank you for watching this
video and i'll see you my next one bye
