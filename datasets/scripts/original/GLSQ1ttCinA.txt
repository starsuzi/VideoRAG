if you're using ice you you put the
recommended time is 20 minutes
to uh to ice down but in this case with
our product you know it's only necessary
to put it on for 10 to 12 minutes and it
does the job
it takes you through what's known as a
physiological pump which is basically an
endorphin release a vasoconstriction and
a vasodilation
and a lot of people don't know this but
when you use cold on the body you're not
putting cold into the joint or the
muscle you're extracting heat just like
a refrigerator you're pulling the heat
out on a localized basis
and you want to do that long enough
to for the to sustain the cold long
enough to reach the deep tissue and so
many of the products are gel based and
don't stay cold long enough and then
consequently they don't re reach the
deep tissue and they don't do the job
sufficiently
