tail what these ones are kind of cool a
this is like the guy that we just lost
in our tank look at these fish there's
like a group of five fish just swimming
in one
spot not every fish here can go in our
tank okay so we can only get community
fish cuz that's what we have so some of
these fish like those ones right there
those are goldfish and goldfish produce
a lot of slime so they can't go with our
fish cuz they'd end up killing our fish
okay and some of these like the cichlids
here they're semi-aggressive and that
means they' be mean to our fish so we
have to find fish that are community
fish guys so that's going to be like
mollies the Guppies the Neons I like
these they have Mickey on their fi yeah
the Mickey Mouse on would be good with
ours we should get some Neons these ones
are really cool these ones will get
along with ours W on get one of these
those ones down there are barbs so
they're semi-aggressive and they would
not get along with ours so we can't get
those on how do you know all the stuff
about fish I know she used to work in a
fish store I did Mommy worked at a fish
store for 3 years wo it's a long time
huh look that fish store I never know
that know that if you ever get to get
and scoop them out like this I was so
good at catching fish you grab your net
you scoop them out really fast and you
put them in a pic bag and you catch the
air and you have the air in the bag but
now a lot of the fish stes have these
little blowers and they can blow air
into them that's totally cheating oh it
is that go through the net if you try to
buy that fish oh look how cute come it's
like the smallest fish ever guys our
fish would probably end up eating it I

table yeah I love making brownies are
you making brownies with Anan yeah my
sister came over cuz we're going to make
brownies we're stirring the eggs and the
sugar and so that they form a beautiful
crust on the top we used our Easter eggs
for
[Music]
this
peppermint here's our chore chart I made
this and we seem to have lost my marker
and the kids have wiped some of it off
in the meantime but it's got all the
main things they want the kids to do
every single day and we finally got
magnets for our shark so you guys pick a
magnet that you like and you guys can
put your magnet in your spot things you
guys have done today I know everybody's
brushed their teeth
today everyone should have their own
color I think yep there's five different
colors I'll have pink
oh I'll just have whatever green so here
it is the things we want the kids to do
every day are clean up their bedroom
make their bed do their schoolwork or
homework practice the piano practice
their voice and their other instrument
that they play read and then help mommy
and finally brushing their teeth three
times a day right guys yeah so one two
three everyone's brushed once so far
today which is good right now the kids
are writing letters back to everybody
who mailed us fan mail this month and
who included a postage paid envelope
with it so some people write as letters
and they include stamped envelopes so if
you do that then we can write a letter
back if you make a really big envelope
then we can put something a little
bigger in there we do have a few though
that did not have stamps and because I'm
really really busy I do not have time to
go to the post office and get stamps on
everybody's envelopes so if you sent us
something without a stamp then that's
probably why you might not get something
back but if you had a stamp on it we'll
definitely write back and there is a
stamp that's like a worldwide
International stamp that you can put on
them so you can mail it from anywhere
it's like a dollar yeah it's like a
dollar a dollar yeah are you guys making
nice letters
[Music]

envelopes Heather's still working on the
