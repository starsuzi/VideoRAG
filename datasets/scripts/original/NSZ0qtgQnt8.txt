hey it's Megan I'm going to be showing
you how to paint a tiey
picture let me just aim my camera I'm
going be showing you how to paint a
tie-dye picture with water color
paint all right
first you take your water
and you
um get it next to you you take a piece
of
paper put it
down and then you cover it in water I
suggest
taking some toilet
paper getting it wet
and brushing it
on the more the merrier in this case
because because the easier it
spreads with the amount of water you use
so I suggest using as much water as
possible without completely ruining your
paper now once you've got that done take
you're going to do this in the col with
the
rainbow so you're going to take either
the lightest color or the darkest color
and go from the inside all the way out
so you can start with red orange yellow
green blue um and you go Violet but I
like to do purple which is violet violet
indigo blue green yellow orange red
because it's just the purple in the
middle really stands to pop out and you
see how it changes and like spreads when
you drip it on you just want to do that
in the shape that you want your tie-dye
to
go and then you'll grab your next
color which me be
blue and you do that all the way around
and then you want to like spread it
out and you will continue to do
this getting new paint every time your
color Fades to match the color it
is until you have it covered in the
rainbow so skip to the very end like the
last 10 seconds to see the finished
product um if you want want to continue
watching you uh you free to stay and
watch if you get to the point where your
Rainbow has run out and you're not off
the paper yet go backwards like if you
end at Green start going back like let's
say right now I ended at Green I'd start
doing blue and then back to purple
but probably by the end of this I'll end
it red and I'll probably start going
back orange and then all the way back
around the rainbow but this one's going
to be a fat one the fatter you do your
um
sections the quicker f space I'm sorry
about my puppy she's insane sh
when you're done also you can sprinkle
like drops of water all over the place
and it'll like spread and ruin certain
parts of the
um painting and the shape of the drop
which will leave a really cool effect or
you can wrinkle your paper up really bad
and then wet
it and then do it because it'll leave
white splots where the wrinkles are and
then you can spotten it back out when
you're done painting when it dries and
it leaves the white marks and where the
curves were and it really makes it look
good if you like this and leave me a
comment asking me to I will post a video
of how to do the wrinkled one with the
white
lines it won't be very dark when you do
it but when it dries it should darken up
depending on your paper if you use
regular printting paper
it's going to lighten but if you use
like parment paper it'll
darken I suggest using the most generic
shade of each
color because if you don't it really
doesn't match like if you use a deep red
and then you go to a bright orange or
like a neon yellow They Don't Really
match so I suggest using the most
generic of each shade you
have and if you don't have that shade
you might want to um mix colors and get
the shade you need because if you don't
have the right Shades together it kind
of looks
awkward it's like hey I'm bright like
purple goes hey I'm bright blue goes hey
I'm bright too green goes I'm bright too
yellow goes I'm bright too and then all
sudden you get to Orange and it's like
I'm deep burnt
orange and it's like what the fudge are
you doing here it just doesn't make
sense but I'm G slow it down because my
laptop doesn't go that fast to do the
Motions you take your paintbrush and you
go and you do it all the way around
as thick thin as you want and as much
paint on there as you want the more
paint the darker the effect but the more
water down your paint is the more it
will spread out and leak like tie dye
should I have one drying over there once
you get to where it's touching all the
way around and you've got only the Four
Corners showing you can just fill in the
four corners with your favorite color
but I like to finish mine all the way
out to the very edge because it makes it
look like it really was
tiedyed if you really do want a TI dyet
you're going to have to actually use ink
because you can't
soak that much um watercolor through
paper without it just completely ruining
the paper and like by the time you open
it it'll shred you actually have to use
inking cloth but that's really out of
your way so I suggest just using
paper and if you're going to blend your
colors like everybody loves to do you
have once you put like I just did Red so
if I wanted to blend the next color into
it I'd have to do it now because if I
blended them all at the end they already
be like half dry and it won't
work just a
hint see like now I'm starting to use
orange again I'm just going to keep
going all the way around until I have
new space
left but if you don't like to repeat
colors you can always fill the
background with pink or black or
white whatever you
want I don't care you can even update
this and make better version send it to
me and be like hey in your face I made a
better version than
you but I will always be proud of the
fact that I gave you the easy version
how to do this all my friends are like
mystified by it I'm like you have no
skill what soever with paint do
you oh and did you know that non-toxic
watercolored
paint will not make your face break out
when you paint your face with it
because um face paints they break your
face out a lot but if you use thickly
mixed watercolored paints they come off
really easy with um like soap you can't
just get it off with water nothing
really works with that but you can get
it off with soap and it comes off easier
than um face paint too and it doesn't
sweat off like if you can you sweat it's
not going to small but it's a lot easier
when you're short onto time
to just mix up some watercolor and not
use that fancy paint that you have to
unlock each different jar of and all
that but it it's a lot better for your
face too it doesn't clog your porest
with the thick serum that
uh face paint
does see for you people that are
watching the entire thing you'll learn a
few tricks that be lazy and rude people
that just skip through won't learn so
you guys have an
PE
coud oh that's another type of orange
oops wrong color if you do a wrong color
it doesn't matter because you can just
blend it and it'll blend right in and be
like hey they Blended doesn't make a
difference I turn every situation into a
person to person thing because you can
understand it a lot better when I'm like
treating everything as a person like
orange and yellow like each other
because they're both warm colors so
they're like hey what's up and they mix
but then
like yellow and purple they're like on
the other side of the color wheel and so
they're just looking at each other like
what is wrong with you you're too close
and when you put them together they
stand out
more I'm almost to the end
see but at this point if you want to
start filling these
Corners with
uh your favorite color that's acceptable
because no one really finishes theirs
they always like to stick the colors in
the corner make it one solid color and
be like Oh I'm done but I like to take
mine to the very
end just because it gives it a little
more it will never be symmetrical you
will never have one
that is perfectly like symmetrical and
won will end at the same spot like I can
keep going with blue on this corner and
this corner but this corner and this
corner are already about be
finished so it just depends on what
shape you do on how it turns out you can
even do like shapes like hearts and
circles and stars you just have to do
the middle shape that shape and the
outside
Yow if you do it right
I think some of my Corners will actually
end purple which makes the
perfectly even
um input of
colors which works to my
advantage and this video is just about
to be over so I just want to talk all
you viewers which there aren't many of
you and I wish there were more but I
love the ones that are here now we'll
take that as a like offensive thing that
I want more everyone wants more viewers
but you
know can't always get what you want when
you have videos like
mine so there's my finished
product a watercolor
TI you can't really see the yellow but
trust me it's there and if it's not
enough for you you can always rewet the
paper after it dries and add
more all right so that was my tutorial
on how to make tie dye
paper so then end
