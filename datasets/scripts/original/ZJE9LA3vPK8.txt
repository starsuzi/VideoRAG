all right here is one of my projects
that's going to be coming up soon it's a
bureau it's a
dresser was covered with a
hideous green paint plus probably a
couple coats of other colors that um we
have to get rid
of here's the
drawer beautiful
accessories on
this so we're going to take the paint
off and make it into something
beautiful all right let's
go okay the first thing we're going to
do is use a stripping
gel and this stuff is the best stuff
that I found so far that works really
quick within 24 hours you can start
scraping
and it doesn't smell that bad no harmful
fumes so let's get started with
that just going to spread some
out and paint it
on and immediately my brush STS
deteriorating into
nothing let's go quick
all right I might need a new
brush well this is what it looks like
after about 15 minutes of
sitting and we're going to keep it on
for a couple hours at
least these are the ones that I've
already
started and I come now coming along
nicely I just need to redo them a little
bit with some
more stripper
all right we'll come back later and
start
scraping okay it's been about almost an
hour since we put it on the
stripper and um we're going
to start seeing what we can get off here
and we're going to use a regular little
scraper like
this see how good it comes off
just scrape all that
[Music]
way usually scrape it into
a a
box so I have to clean it up just throw
it out in the trash
and after this we'll be
sanding so stay tuned and follow me for
a sanding part portion of it thank you
