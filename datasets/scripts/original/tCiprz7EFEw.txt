crazy
i'm living on the edge
no i'm not hey guys how's it going so
today i'm going to share with you one of
my favorite drinks of all time which is
the green tea latte by starbucks
and as we all know starbucks can get
pretty expensive if you go there on a
regular basis
and i have a friend who used to work at
starbucks so she gave me a lot of tips
and tricks on the proportions and
the products and this is super
super easy and it and i i'm not lying to
you it tastes probably 95 like the
starbucks one and all these ingredients
are adjustable to your taste preference
do
do
i hope you guys like this recipe and let
me know if you try it
it is super simple and i'm super thirsty
anyways if you guys have instagram

my um name here below as always and i
post a lot of food pictures for all you

keep in touch that way and i will see
