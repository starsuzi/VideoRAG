hi everyone and welcome to everything
DIY the channel that's dedicated to
helping you do it yourself and save some
money in the process
um my name is Ali and today I'm going to
help you change your brakes let's get
started okay first things first I'm an
energy c2 the tools we're going to be
using today for this project so we have
a craftsman ratchet 12 millimeter socket
some standard brake cleaner RC clamp
which is optional but we'll explain
later I have a coarse brakes some brake
grease tire iron which is very important
for this project and the jack that came
with the car first we have some safety
precautions very important we need to
make sure that the car is in park and
the security brake is on followed by
placing a piece of wood tires
now that everything's secured it's time
to lift the car
you know jack in place
make sure it's hooked in securely
now it's time to take off the Tucker
so if you have a tire lock key is a good
place to start
head and put it in there
or go ahead and start twisting these off
now that we have all of the bolts off
we're gonna go ahead up with this higher
put it off to the side for now
so changing your brakes is actually
pretty basic we have three pieces of
metal the rotor the pads and the caliper
so today we're going to be changing the
brake pads which are held into place by
two bolts in the back so I'm going to go
ahead and take those off
then we have the one on the bottom
so now that both the bolts are off we're
going to go ahead and take off the
caliper
I'm going to go ahead and put it up here
get out of the way make sure you have it
in a good spot so I won't fall next I'm
going to take off the brake pads
ah
here we have the new ones
so you can tell mine are pretty rundown
I have no meat left on that pad this is
what a new one looks like can tell by
putting them side by side the difference
so now we're going to go ahead and clean
the brakes we're going to put some
plastic down to catch any drippings grab
your brake cleaner and you're going to
spray anything that the brake touches
basically so we're just going to clean
off the brake dust and everything else
that's on here we're gonna grab the
caliper and we're going to go ahead and
clean the piston now once everything's
dry you're going to grab when your old
brake pads and you need to get this
piston back in its original place
because as these brakes wear down the
piston is going to push out to make up
for the lack of meat on your brakes so
we need to go ahead and push that in I'm
going to go ahead and put our brake back
I'm going to use a c-clamp here to push
it back into place
sure it's secure let's start pushing it
back in you can see it slowly start to
move back into its spot okay once it's
back in its spot go ahead and loosen it
up take away the clamp we're going to
put our brake pad down and you can see
that it's all the way pushed in so now
we're going to go ahead and prep our
brakes for the installation so we're
going to grab our brakes and our grease
and what we're going to do is we're
going to grease every part of the brake
that touches the caliper including these
little shims here which are the metal
pieces on the sides around the corners
around the corners and we should be good
now we're doing this in order to reduce
noise from the brakes go ahead and open
this real quick
I'm on there
just make sure it's all covered
grab a little more
on your finger and we're gonna grease
the edges here
it's like that
a little more on this
now I'm going to go ahead and do the
second one we'll put this one down
okay
grab your grease
all right so go ahead and wipe off the
grease that you just worked with we
don't want to get those on the brake
pads themselves is somewhat dangerous
for your brakes so we're going to go
ahead and put the front one on first
these little slots here now put that in
like that
sure it's secure
I'm going to go ahead and install the
second one in the back
ah
so now it's time to go ahead and replace
the caliper
make sure that the backings match up
because that's where we need to put our
bolts again so we're going to go ahead
and put this one in make sure it matches
and then we need to put the one on the
bottom in as well
now we're going to use our ratchet again
and we're going to go ahead and tighten
them
as tight as you can do it is just fine
down to the bottom
again make it as tight as you can
so now you're done changing the brakes
on this side so we're going to go ahead
and put our tire back on and get started
on the other side so once you finished
with the other side you're all cleaned
up you're going to want to do one more
step and that's pump the brakes until
they're firm to the touch so you're
going to go ahead and do that now
okay so they started to stiffen
I can fill it with my foot now
and that means that you're all done with
your break change so if you like our
