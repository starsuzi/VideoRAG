hello everyone welcome back to another
great episode of rana's Cuisines before
we get started I would like to thank
each and every one of my subscribers out
there um thank you for you guys have
been absolutely great I am also um you
can keep in touch with me through
Instagram Google+
um
YouTube um what else what else what else
what else email and Facebook so that's
how you can keep in touch with me but
really really really thank you so much
for um all your
support um today we're going to be doing
my most requested recipe um and that is
learning how to make puff pastry from
scratch now I know this can be very very
intimidating cuz I was intimidated for
the longest time for making this but I'm
going to make this um I'm going to make
this really step to step by step I'm
going to tell you exactly what to do and
it's going to be very very simple I like
to have my um videos very very simple so
let's get started we'll review all the
ingredients and then we will also while
I'm um doing the dough we will also talk
about the difference between puff pastry
and shortcut pastry so let's get started
number one what I have here is four cups
of white flour just white flour bought
from the store just put it in here four
cups I have here one pound of unsalted
butter now don't panic because this four
one lound of let me go back one pound of
butter is going to make 50 pastries so
it does go a long way so
um here I have half a lime we're going
to be squeezing half a lime in it my
butter is unsalted so we are going to be
adding some salt in there and I have ice
cold water here about 2 cups I think
we're going to need all the whole two
cups but we'll see once we start binding
our
dough
now I have a really bad cough so you
guys will just have to bear with me
okay all right so
once and the other thing is also I
wanted to point out that your butter
does not have to be frozen it does not
have to be cold it can just be room
temperature but also I mean it shouldn't
be where it's like melting away but it
should just be enough where it's holding
its shape and it's nice and you know
nice and firm so now I've got four
sticks here making up 4
lb so one stick is 4 oz so we're going
to put 4 oz of butter first into our
flour with the salt and then what we're
going to do is we're going to rub it
together and make it like um where it
resembles a crumbly mixture the other 12
oz we will after binding our dough we
will put it inside our but or inside our
dough so let me go ahead and add salt in
here and you just kind of want to
eyeball the salt so I would say I have
put in a good 2 teaspoons of salt and
I'm just going to put this on the side I
just want to mix the salt and the flour
well before I um start mixing the butter
okay so now with your hands you just
want
to start crumbling the butter just like
so just
like so do you see that it's not really
soft um like melty soft but it's it's uh
it's good enough for us to work with
now this step is very important cuz you
want to get that crumbly mixture it's
important to massage the um flour and
the butter together really
well so going back to discussing I've
had lots of questions on me wanting to
talk to you about shortcut pastry and
regular
pastry now when we make regular pastry
which is this here this this is used
mostly for like
cookies um in Gujarati we also say Cara
biscuits um you can use it for like
making those pin wheel cookies you can
use it for um just rolling it out
putting like chicken or whatever you
want on it natilla or whatever roll it
up make slices and then baking it so
basically you kind of want something
that's going to layer up a little bit
it's going to be crispy it's going to be
golden Now shortcut pastry is done a
little bit differently where you know
you're going to use it mostly for like
putting it on like a chicken pot pie or
making tarts with it or using it mostly
just like a pie crust mostly like a pie
crust so or you know that's mostly what
I use it for and that's how I
differentiate the two in my kitchen okay
so do you see here it doesn't take very
long but just you have to make sure that
you kind of so when you see here when
you do this it's going to like hold its
shape see that it's going to hold the
shape and that means that the butter has
really gotten into the
flower okay now to this what I'm going
to do is oops sorry about that going to
add the
line and you really want to stick to
half a line you don't want any more than
that
okay and then we are also I have one
sitting in the refrigerator so we're
also going to um be uh baking up some
pastries to show you exactly what it's
going to look like okay so now we're
going to slowly don't put all the water
in just slowly slowly we're going to
start and we're going to start binding
the dough okay
now there's steps that we need to do for
this once we roll the dough out and put
the butter in it I'll show you how we're
going to start rolling it then it needs
to um go in the refrigerator so
basically got my ring stuck there um
basically what you want to do
is remember six always remember six
that's how I remember it so the first
time we're going to fold it two times
and then and I'll show you exactly how
then we're going to stick it in the
refrigerator after 20 minutes we're
coming coming back we'll take it out
we'll roll it again two more
times then we'll put it back in the
refrigerator and then we'll take it out
one more time so one more time so that
means that we've got this the next two
the next two steps STS we're again going
to roll it out and that's it so always
remember pastry six I always remember it
that way that's how you know I uh
remember how many times we have to um
fold it once you get that down seriously
this is like a breeze it's not that big
of a deal to make it at home and I love
the home pastries just because they stay
crispier for a longer period of time
they're a little bit more harder and
they don't like they're not soft where
it flakes out completely because you
want the texture of the pastry to you
know be you know um nice and a little
bit stiff not like too soft cuz you also
want to uh you know want you want to
taste that filling whatever you have in
the middle and the filling can be you
know really up to you you could either
do um ground beef where you just sauté
ground beef with um onions and bell
pepper U sorry onions and ginger and
garlic and
you know uh just dry sauté it you can do
it that way or you can make a vegetarian
one where you just um do potatoes and
and I will do a video of just the
vegetable filling that can be used for
either this or Punjabi samosas so um you
know so it really the the and you can
also use these to make apple turnovers
oh my God they turn out so good homemade
pastry you have less preservatives it
free freees for about 6 months and you
get two two two blocks of you're going
to add two blocks of these which if
you're just doing the
pastries you're going to get out 50
pastries
so um and it's going to be way cheaper
than buying it from the store so see how
we have our dough here you know it's not
really stiff It's Not So Soft it's I
mean it's just in the middle and you
wanted where it's just you know um
cleaning up your bowl all the way on the
side now this dough we're going to let
it rest I'm going to cover it we're
going to let it rest for at least 10 to
15 minutes um let the gluten and
everything and flour is like it has like
little pockets in there just remember
flour is having little pockets right now
it's going to absorb everything that we
put in and that's exactly what we want
to do and um I'm sorry I've been
jabbering a lot but there's a lot of
information out there and I've got Cooks
from really 10 years old to you know
seniors so really um the information I
think is very important so now we're
going to let this rest about 15 20
minutes when we come back we're going to
start folding this and I'm going to show
you how it's
done so we're back here and I just let
it rest for about 20
minutes and it's good see that's
good just going to put it
down
okay and what we're going to
do
is I think I'll be more comfortable if I
have my gloves
on okay
okay okay so now what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to slice the dough
like this
so we're going to open it up just like
that now we're going to
add our butter in here and this cannot
be made with
oil this cannot be made with any
oil or any other margarine or anything
like that this is puff pastry and you
know to get the optimal result results
you have to have to use butter
okay so
now okay now what you want to do just
want to bring up all the sides just like
that and this recipe by the way was T to
me by my mom
so thanks Mom if it wasn't for you I
wouldn't know how to make this okay now
I'm just going to add some
flour and you want to have a little bit
of a working surface so if you see I've
used I usually use my other little uh
smaller not little smaller cutting board
or um kneading board I'm going to use a
big one now just so that I'm comfortable
cuz we're going to roll this out so in
fact I have to move this forgot that
we're going to be rolling it more this
way
okay now you just want to keep on
rolling first the middle I would say cuz
all that FL um butter is in the
middle okay you want to keep on dusting
it with
flour and then also don't forget to turn
it around so you don't are not just
kneading on one area and then you're
going to have all that butter come out
on you now if you have a little bit of
butter that comes out don't worry you're
fine just either put flour on it and
just keep on
rolling
okay so if you can see here there's an
air bubble here just going to pop
that okay there we
go okay
going to go ahead turn it around go
ahead and fold it just like
that so this is fold number one
important fold number one so we got how
many more folds to go we've got five
more folds to go so now from Rolling it
like this I'm going to turn it around
and I'm going to roll it the opposite
way
and these folds are very important and
it's also very important to put it in
the refrigerator for 20 minutes if you
plan to do the all the um folds at one
time it's not going to work the gluten
is really going to build up and you're
really going to have like a very very
hard stiff dough and it's not going to
work okay I'm just going to keep it like
this I don't want to confuse you just
want to um roll it out so it's also not
only just oblong length but also we've
got the thickness here and this here um
you'll it'll go to normal once it's just
a butter that's sticking out
okay there we
go so I'm also going to be using this
pastry dough to make a leak and onion
casserole um type of thing so make sure
you watch out for that so if you haven't
subscribed so we're going to get the uh
pastry
out 20 minutes it's been 20
minutes so what I usually
do is I just remember it so we we
already folded it
twice right so
now now see how it's folded this way so
we're going to go and we're going to
start with the opposite way okay so now
again we're going to put some flour so
we don't have any of that uh um um
butter oozing
out okay we're going to start
rolling
okay turn it around
okay you just want to make it long
enough so you can fold it so there we go
that's fold
number three now again we're going to
turn it out
opposite flour it just a little bit
here okay
okay I'm just going to turn this just a
little bit so I can get the
with
done and and this foldings are where
we're going to get our layers from so
when we cut into it cuz like I told you
we're going to have
two um pastri uh two um two pastry
bunches where that's how they're going
to go in the freezer so when we take one
out one will make about 24 to
25
so just want to make it just a tad bit
longer here
you can just eyeball how um long it is I
have a measuring here we can do that we
can measure it so it's exactly 14 in so
that's
perfect so now again
opposite and this is fold number
four so now again we're going to put it
back into our foil and we have the last
time that we're going to put it into the
refrigerator I'm just going to put a
four there sometimes when I get really
really busy I wonder well you know how
many times how many folds do I have to
do so I know I've already done the four
folds and now again I'll stick it into
the refrigerator so I got this out and
remember how I marked it for that means
that I've already rolled it four
times I'm just want to be careful I want
to save this foil cuz we're going to use
it use it to wrap here all right so see
how it is wrapped like
this so what we're going to do is for
the last time flower our board and go
the opposite way
again so now there are other videos out
there they don't show the whole three
and some of you might be bored but I
really had to show this because the
comments like I said I have got viewers
as young as 10 years old that watch my
videos and you know um had to show the
whole procedure because this can be
really really really confusing for those
who are not um Advanced Cooks so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
roll it the fifth time got some black
sesame seeds on here cuz I was rolling
it out for the other one here so okay so
that's five all right so now we do six
and again we're going to do it the
opposite okay so this is the last time
we're going to roll it now I'm not going
to make this really really big
I'm just going to make sure that it's
thick and my middle is also rolled
out
okay so at this point now what I'm going
to do is I just want to measure it it
has to be around 12 in I've got just a
little bit to go
okay so
now you just want to put it right there
and I'm going to measure six right there
and I'm just going to cut
it okay I want you to see this want you
to see all these layers it's really
important for you to see the layers and
this is what's going to give our puff
pastry um the puff basically so this is
done another very important thing that I
want to tell you is when the packaging
of your pastry I cannot I cannot
emphasize enough that please please
package your pastry properly if you just
put it in foil sometimes the foil breaks
up in the uh in the uh in the freezer
cuz you might move things around and
then you've got pastry with freezer burn
and it smells icky so what I usually
do is what I usually do is I package it
twice so I'm going to put it in here and
I'm going to put the plastic on top of
it I'm going to wrap it up really nice
and
tight
okay and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take my heavy duty foil not
going to put it in just any foil it's
really important that you use heavy duty
foil for this okay so you want to put
that right on just like
so and don't skimp on the foil when
you're making your pastry cuz you know
it takes a lot of hard work to get it up
to
here okay and then the only thing left
now is that I will make sure that I date
it so
6 to 8 months in the
freezer so we're going to put this on
the
side okay now I'm going to show
you it's hot let me just put it right
over
here our pastry see how it's
done and what we're going to do is I'm
just quickly going to show you I'm made
one video in um Gujarati which was my
mother tongue language and it's on
YouTube and I got so many comments um
emails saying well why didn't you um
show us the end product of when the
video is
done so um for this video I feel like
I'm just going to show you the end
product here so even though I had made
those score uh it looks like I can't
really see well I can so I'm just going
to go ahead and you know um do it just
like like
that
okay and I'm not going all the way
through right now I just want to make
sure that I've got my pieces
right 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17 18 19 got 20 out of this one I should
have rolled it a little bit more when we
first did it but okay
so you just want to make pieces like
this and you can see you can still see
the layers of the butter see how they're
all layers it's going to turn out really
really
good once you start making this you're
not even you're going to stop just
buying pastry Al together because the
taste is just something else so here we
go
I just like pushed it down so I can have
a little bit of oops I need this
one okay just going to roll it into a
square
shape there's um a couple ways that you
can make these you can either make them
into like a triangle shape or you could
make it into just a a
quick you know just like that just looks
like um okay I need to grab a you was
for getting something need a
fork okay so now I've got two types of
fillings here I've got here um just a
ground beef mixture that you know just
uh mixed it and just um dried up the
water added ginger garlic I've got a
video in Gujarati in my mother tongue
language if you just want to see the
procedure done and then here I have a
potato in peas mixture which is
completely vegetarian now as you can see
it's smoking cuz I just made it and this
video is also uploaded on you Youtube so
if you want to see the vegetarian how I
did it you can see it on there right now
I'm just going to be filling it with the
ground beef mixture just because the
other mixture is really hot right now
and I need for it to completely cool
down before I can start stuffing them in
here so you just want to put about a
tablespoon of mixture in here and I'm
just going to go ahead and just fold it
like so so okay now because this was our
end piece it's not going to be like um
completely triangle but it's good enough
and I'm just going to close it up
here with um just a fork just like
that and then what I'm going to do put
it on
my um in my tray and I'm going to give
it an egg wash so I'm going to egg put
it putting egg wash in it now let me
just quick quickly roll out one more to
show you um the other way that you can
fold
this so you could do the triangle shape
and then you can
do
okay put about a tablespoon
of mixture maybe just a little more just
like
so just overlap it so it's like in a
square
shaped now I'm also going to be
uploading a um recipe of how I make a
filling from dates and it's an amazing
mixture so it's going to be a sweet
concoction of uh filling for these kind
of pastries and they turn out absolutely
amazing so you've got the pastry and you
bite in it and it just hits you with
like fennel and dates so make sure you
check out that video as well so do you
see here I'm just going to do two here
for you to see I've got one in triangle
shaped and I've got one in more of a
square shaped so basically that's it for
this um when you put your make sure you
put your egg wash on there and now
there's one very important thing I'm
going to quickly close the video video
but um one very very important thing and
that is that when you want to bake these
pastries up you want to make sure that
you put it at 400 or
425° if your oven is extremely low in
temperature like if you put it at 325 or
350 what's going to happen is it's going
to have too much time and all your
pastes are going to open up so by having
the temperature of the pastries higher
um pastries are going to stay intact
now I want to show you a little bit of
differences hereo it's hot okay
so what I did was I just like dressing
my food up so with this one I had um
dried parsley and I had sumach that I
put on here on here I put black sesame
seeds and sumach on this one I just did
just sumach this one I just did um green
uh The Parsley dried parsley
uh again dried parsley and this one here
is just black sesame seeds this here is
are plain ones now this here I want to
show you is how you make your cookies at
home if you want the pastry cookies
which is also called carab biscuits this
is how they're made look at the puff in
it see and if you try
it it's still hot but look at the puff
in there look at how
it's look at the layers in there it's
just beautiful it's just it just tastes
really really good homemade now a quick
pointer before I close and I promise
this will be the last pointer if you
want to make these like you know Curry
type of thing like a curried um Kira
biscuits or curried flavor in it just
put in a little bit of turmeric and um
you can add like a little bit of um
crushed um Crush fresh coriander a
little bit of Sesame or sorry coriander
and a little bit of um turmeric you know
your salt some giga garlic paste when
you're binding the dough and that will
give you a really nice um flavor of like
a curried puff pastry so that's it I'm
not taking any more of your time I'm
sorry if this video has become long for
you guys I really apologize for that but
I hope um that you guys enjoyed this
time with me I thank you for sharing
your time with me me thank you for so
