hey guys i want to do a really quick
simple video for you
um i notice a lot of people have a hard
time for some reason getting off
vinyl stickers on their uh on their car
as long as it's on their glass
they think that you need all this goo
gone and everything like that so i just
want to show you a quick
simple way that all you need is a razor
blade
coming like this first you want to take
off
the letters
like that just expose those
and then you have this glue residue
that's left
and you don't even need goo gone for
that if you actually just go
back over it with your razor blade and
no you will not
scratch your glass and you just come
down
and that's it grab a uh
grab a microfiber
just wipe it off
you cannot even tell it was there so i
just wanted to make a quick video for
that
to help out some people because uh there
are some people that get pretty confused
and get concerned with it
so just thought i would make this for
those people thanks
