hi Rick Patterson with the handyman
toolbox thanks for coming to my video
today
I have a situation where I'm remodeling
a house and I'm in the bathroom and I
put in a new vanity in the sink and now
what I've done is I've got a space
um let's say about a quarter of an inch
on either side that does not touch the
walls it's not flush I don't want to run
caulking of any kind or anything like
that I just just don't want that look
so I'm going to try to solve that by
putting an extension in there let me
show you how how what this is going to
look like
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so again as you can see you've got I've
got a little bit of a space here on
either side and I don't want to put any
caulking on here just because I just
don't want that look if it was tile I
might do that but this is a formica top
and it's got a bull nose to it with a
beveled Edge
so I'm going to show you how I'm going
to overcome this on both sides okay so I
have a manufacturer called countertop
and this is a countertop in Splash kit
and as you can tell this right here will
match the bull nose and then this will
match the other end as it curves down
so what I do here is just go ahead and
set it up there to make sure it matches
and everything's good on it and it looks
beautiful looks a lot better than having
that exposed Edge on there so what I'm
going to do here now is use what I call
power grip and this is all purpose and
if you haven't seen my videos on how to
use a caulk gun go ahead and look for
that when you finish this video here in
the meantime
I'm just going to take this Edge right
here and
apply some of the
power grip caulking
and just know that any excess that you
have you want to make sure that you wipe
it up immediately
so I'm gonna go ahead and apply
here on the bottom side as I go
all the way around don't need to do any
of the bottom I don't want to do any at
the bottom because I don't want anything
to get on there but I don't need
anything on the very end because
uh well I might do a little bit right
there okay now what I do is
take this
and I'm not going to slide it in I'm
just going to fit it in
and just push it on
really nice and neat there
and you're going to want some paper of
any kind to wipe it up
I'll just grab some toilet paper here
push down in the corner
this is going to dry clear
so there's no real
danger of oh my gosh you got wide
everywhere
anything crazy like that
so you just keep wiping until
get all the excess off
okay
and then you're done
there
on that side
and then I'm going to repeat that on the
opposite side as well
now what I did not mention is you want
to go ahead and put another bead along
the edge so it's going to be the bottom
Edge over here to make the stick to the
wall better and of course I did the same
thing right here as I did on the right
side again just going to take it
push it
all the way up
there we go
just want to make sure everything fits
tight the way it should
and it looks like I have an obstruction
right here in the very corner so I'm
going to have to take this up
and then remove that obstruction
and then reseat this
so it looks like I've got some debris or
something right here in the very corner
so I'm going to take care of that
okay so I've taken care of that
obstruction there
and I'm just going to take it make sure
it's completely
seated
everything's good I am putting a little
bit of pressure
and of course
along here
I'm going to come back and wipe this
down really really good
with some
wet paper
this stuff does stick and if you're
giving you this
adhesive
on the countertop while it's drying you
can just pretty much roll it
with your finger it'll roll up
so I'm going to go ahead and clean this
up now
oh there you have how to install the end
cap on the countertop for the vanity in
the bathroom
