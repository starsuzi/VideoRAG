[MUSIC]
Woah, are you seeing this guy right now?
That dude's rig is fully slim.
Thrasher hoodie.
Is that Theotis Beasley?
Yo!
Is that Tabasko Sweet over there?
He knows who I am?
What's good?
Trying to play skate?
I know somebody at home,
I gotta go to my crib real quick.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Really?
[MUSIC]
All right family, what's up?
It's your boy Nate, a.k.a Tabasko Sweet.
You're watching Cheap Thrills.
You already know what it is, right?
Cool.
Now I'm about to show you
how to bless yourself,
with the most crucial part of skate
wear out, the iconic thrasher hoodie.
As seen our boy,
Theotis the legend, back there.
Now this hoodie is a fall
street wear staple.
Simple, versatile, and hard as [BLEEP].
Now the legendary chest logo has been
a symbol of skate culture since 1991.
Nowadays, skaters aren't the only
ones rocking the thrasher hoodie.
It snuck its way into
the high piece of mainstream.
I'm talking Travis Scott,
Lil North West, Sage the Gemini.
I mean your boy Tyler the Creator
has like five of these things.
And we can't forget Earl Sweatshirt,
now you know that man knows
his way around a pullover.
Now these joints retail at about $60, but
they're always going up
because of that high demand.
These hoodies stay selling out.
60 bucks is a little pricy.
[SOUND] I don't know about you but
your boy is out here trying to
clock these gains,
unless thrasher gets wise and sponsors me.
So what do you say family?
Does it skate or die?
[SOUND] So here's what you're gonna need.
A plain black hoodie.
And remember family, it's XXL or nothing.
An XACTO knife.
[SOUND] White fabric paint and
a thin brush.
Large stencil paper.
[MUSIC]
A cutting surface, pencil.
So your first step is gonna be to draw
your iconic Thrasher logo on your
stencil paper.
Now I just free handed this one for
you guys to save some time.
But when you do this at home,
you're probably gonna need some reference.
Now to get the sizing right,
you wanna measure the front pocket.
The width of the chest logo
should be about the same.
Now, before we cut this guy out,
we're gonna wanna tape the corners so
it's not sliding around everywhere.
[MUSIC]
Speaking of sliding around, pro tip.
Never choose Luigi when
you're playing Mario Kart.
That fool's always sliding around,
like [SOUND].
Very clean.
Now it's time to get it cut, but
remember this are sharp as well.
[SOUND].
As always precision is key, rip that CVD.
[MUSIC]
Remember a steady hand and a steady mind.
I'm just cutting out my letters.
You already know what the [BLEEP] it is.
[MUSIC]
Even though I'm in a hurry,
I'm still taking my time, family.
If I [BLEEP] this up,
it's a dead giveaway.
[MUSIC]
Now I've been seeing a lot of comments,
people saying your boy
Tabasko Sweet doesn't try anymore.
Damn, chilly.
[MUSIC]
A lot of people were talking
about how dirty my nails were.
Sorry, my nails get dirty.
Your boys out here crafting all day.
You'll be happy to know today
they're nice and clean.
And speaking of clean,
I'm serving up a very clean piece for
your collection today.
I hear you family.
I'm out here doing it for you.
Now let's get to painting on our hoodie.
[MUSIC]
Now I'm gonna take my
cardboard cutting surface and
put it inside the hoodie where
the chest logo is gonna go.
[MUSIC]
This is gonna give us a sturdier surface
for painting and prevent bleed through.
[MUSIC]
Not we're laying down our chest piece.
And remember, placement is critical.
[MUSIC]
This stencil paper can get slippery.
Slippery, excuse me.
[MUSIC]
Lock and load, baby.
Now let's get our fabric paint.
[MUSIC]
Now I'm using my paintbrush
to lock in our logo.
[MUSIC]
Now I recommend the small brush for
precision, but I'm in a hurry so
I'm going with my fat tip.
Get that pinner [BLEEP] out of here.
[MUSIC]
Yeah.
Speed mode.
[MUSIC]
All right, all done.
Now we're just gonna let this
thing dry for about 20 minutes.
Let's see how we did.
[MUSIC]
Hoo!
Fuego alert.
Somebody call 911.
Now since I'm high key running out
of time, I'm just gonna come in and
quickly freehand the skateboard
magazine lettering under the Thrasher.
[MUSIC]
Don't go anywhere Theotis,
I'm on my way back, dead ass.
[MUSIC]
Are you seeing this right now?
I've really outdone myself this time
anything for my cheap thrills fam.
Gang gang.
While this is drying let's
get ready to go skate.
I'm about to bust some mad ollies and
pop some like kickflips.
Yeah kickflips, trust.
Your boy learned everything he need
to know from comping mad hours on
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater two.
You know I stay on my grind.
Triangle, triangle, triangle.
Now when you roll up to a skate
park with this thing on everyone's
gonna think you can bust
a six stair gap like nothing.
Onto some god tier [BLEEP].
[SOUND]
[MUSIC]
All right, let's get back to the spot.
Come on dude they're waiting for me.
Sound guy come on let's go.
Get out my way dude I can't blow this.
[BLEEP] Got my board.
Outfit's on ten.
I hope Otis is still here.
I'm ready to skate or
die family let's do this.
Yo Theotis, what's good?
I'm back man,
I told you I was coming back.
Yo, I see you've got your boy,

Come on man, what's your team up.
Let's go, let's go.
[MUSIC]

[MUSIC]
Dude, I gotta tell you something man.
What's up?

But I was kinda hoping maybe you
could teach me a thing or two.
So I'm not just another
poser wearing Thrasher, man.

Any advice on how to land one?
Listen, first you've got to get the flame
logo like your boy, that's number one.
Second you gotta learn how to
keep those feet off the ground.
You gotta learn how to alley.
Land the trick, then land the chick.
Absolutely, you got it.

I've got time for all that source.
I mean, agree or disagree.
Okay, that's fair.
Everyone knows you as a skater.
So what are you doing when you're not

What's skating with lawn lane like?

Til like 7, you just gotta go to sleep,
I'll be tired around that time.
Damn, a sneaky skater.
So you think its maybe, because he
doesn't want to get spotted or what?
That could be that.
The homie like to be out there creeping.
That's pretty sas, but also lit.

Dead or alive, who would you sesh up with?
Shane Cross Legend.
I know you were hella young when
you first got picked up by Baker.
But when did you get
your first skateboard?
I was about 10 years old.
Damn so I'm already like 22 years old.
Is it too late for me?

to sign up for the Theotis Academy,

I don't want you to sink.
Don't come off the board,
stay on the board.
[MUSIC]
Yeah that was.
That was one of the hardest
