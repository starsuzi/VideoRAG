hi Dan Vincent from Laguna Beach
California you know not all chocolate
martinis are made the same I'm going to
show you how to do with the original way
the best way cuz the whole illusion of
the chocolate martini is it's supposed
to be clear and tastes like chocolate
you can't figure out why but I'm going
to show you how okay we're going to
start right now with this glass cherry
garnish we use
vodka white cream to Cocoa that's the
secret right there equal parts of this
[Music]
lean a little bit more on
the the white creamy Coco lean a little
more than that less
vodka again sh it very
vigorously this is a fun fesive drink
you am light taste you'll love
it Pour this into the glass and to add
just a little bit of flavor or a little
bit of color also add a little bit of
col it goes to the bottom of the glass
so it covers the Cherry nice looking
drink huh you'll love it
enjoy I have a lot of them
