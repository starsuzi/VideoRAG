hello everyone today gonna show you how
to unblock drinks at home by yourself so
will save you a lot of money that is the
tools we're using today they just screw
on in to each other but things to pay
attention to for example this one once
you connected them make sure you only
turn your tool clockwise or
anti-clockwise if you don't do it this
way you will lose the head of your tools
for example this one into the hole
that will cause you a lot of trouble and
hustle if they go to the gutter after we
use this make sure you wash them then
put them into the plastic bag mine is
quite old so I bought from B&Q and weeks
weeks also sells them is not expensive
okay put them together in the back so
job done a lot of people also buy this
bamboo stick ones but personally I
prefer this hard plastic ones because
they are lasts more longer years okay
let's start take one out today use this
one I won't need all of them probably
two of them well two let's see examine
the situation now full of poo dirty
water we connect this plunger is very
popular this round black thing that's
what we're gonna use today okay
what we are doing now is at the bottom
of this sink we find the gutter so make
our suction do not I mean if you know
you got that white ball
well that's that's a palm tree like you
doing there on the bar Jimmy to
jump-jump-jump that's what I'm doing on
that side pipe
for is funding the other day I first
could I think a wire must be put to my
collars good David just quite annoying
though
[Music]
but the hoes in there
you gotta run down that
to that I'm doing so putting that I can
feel it
yeah down there an antenna Jeong Jeong
Jeong gets a bit of suction you're
pushing like that you'd find that gully
up down and you sort of there you go
if at your home is exactly the same like
mine which is quite old I have measured
the emergency cover in the middle of the
little north to the ground is exactly 47
centimeters so try not to open the
emergency late trying to do this way
first if it doesn't work you had to use
a little pocket shifted a out then
rinse it out once you see the emergency
lady you can pull it open I have been
told to make sure the emergency laid
cover is always closing like this hope

best thank you very much for watching
