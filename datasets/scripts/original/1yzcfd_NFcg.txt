scared you did that hey uh good morning
YouTubers uh today uh I'll be showing
you a technique I develop how to destroy
those golfers or mold in your backyard
we be ediz the repellent some people
have said that the repellent doesn't
work at all I'mma show you a proven
method that will work no matter what you
do observe what I'm going to do all you
do you go to your nearest store and
you'll probably purchase you a stick of
gum a pack of gum so you're going to cut
it in half like
so this is my gum I'm going to cut my
gum in
half and as you plant this on the ground
you can put several pieces in one of
their goers hole or you can put just one
and preferably
every 24 in I place one down what I'll
do is I purchase some hot shot which is
like a roach killer or M boric acid you
get it from your more supply stores and
I'll shake a
little the powder in here on the gum
just a little you don't need much at
all just a little that's boric acid just
a little now some people uh purchas
already purchase their
uh repellant already the duax repellant
that works from the ground on top down
to the bottom in the past this is not
work for me so I've developed a better
way that it will work you can still use
your uh repellant like
[Applause]
so take a little bit of your repellent
out slide it through the silver and the
gum like that right there here now as
you notice this the I got the repellent
in here plus I have a little bit of the
hot shot boric acid in
there now normally you'll probably walk
around and you see a tunnel duger up
around the neighborhood or dug in your
backyard once you see that tunnel
observe down on the ground please once
you see that tunnel on the ground all
you got to do when you see that tunnel
is take a sharp object stick it straight
down and you'll feel a Hollow Path once
you feel a Hollow Path you stop that
means that you've just reached this
hunel ease back up make sure the air is
kind of clear like so same time you have
your stick of gum keep it
closed and easy straight
down all the way down to the
bottom dig the hold little more
deeper
there you go now once you dig the hole
deeper you don't have to cover it up
just take a a pebble or Rock piece of
dirt and place it on
top you want you try not to disturb that
area much as possible and I guarantee
you without a shadow of a doubt within
two weeks come back and check the whole
backyard wherever you put those areas at
and you will rid of
your mole and golfers
thank you
