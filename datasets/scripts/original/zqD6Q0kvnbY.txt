hi everybody and welcome to the first
episode of Dave's kitchen this is
actually a spin-off of our grade recipes
we're just coming up with a new format
and trying to make things a little more
personal for you and we're going to kick
this first episode off with some goulash
now goulash is actually a Hungarian dish
by origin and it's kind of a hodge podge
of everything and it's been adopted by
many cultures uh specifically American
and Canadians and is primarily hamburger
based with some noodles and some tomato
sauce and this is my Canadian version of
goulash I'm sure you're going to love it
so let's get
started let's begin by adding a bit of
oil to a preheated pan and I'm just
going to place the beef in now I'm using
a fairly lean ground beef here cuz you
don't want it too fatty and we're just
going to break it up a bit here in the
pan I'm going to fry this over medium
high heat just until it begins to turn
brown now the meat is beginning to turn
brown let's add in the
onion the chopped
garlic then I'm going to stir this and
cook just until the onions begin to turn
translucent and this should take I'd say
oh 2 to 3 minutes
now we're going to pour the water
in add in the stewed tomatoes now these
are our very own stewed tomatoes and of
course I'll put a link to these below if
you don't have stew Tomatoes you could
use diced or even tomato
sauce then the
peppera followed by the chili
powder the soy
sauce and the worst sire sauce which
like many people I can never
say the tomato paste which gives it a
little bit of extra body and texture
fresh basil now if you don't have fresh
basil you can always use the dried stuff
I just find fresh basil gives it a
little more
kick some freshly ground
pepper and we'll just give this a stir
until everything is well
Incorporated bring it to a slight boil
and add in the
leaves and we're going to slip a lid on
this and allow it to simmer over low
heat for about 20 to 25
minutes after 20 to 25 minutes what
we're going to do is add in the macaroni
noodles now you can use just about any
noodle you want in this but macaroni
noodles are pretty traditional in
goulash and I'm just going to give this
stir until the noodles are well mixed
in then we're going to place a lid on
this again and allow it to simmer over
low heat for an additional 20 minutes or
until the noodles are
tender after about 20 minutes and the
noodles are tender we're going to give
this a taste test and if it needs a
little more salt and pepper go ahead and
add it and there we have it you're ready
to
serve and here is our simple and easy
goulash great for a weekday meal you're
