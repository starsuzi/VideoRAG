hey guys Eric from Vinyl mayam here I
wanted to show you the easiest way how
to remove stickers off glass or off a
window um so we got some old stickers
here going to change them out first
thing you want to do is clean the glass
get rid of all the dust dirt everything
that's on the
glass so using some glass cleaner and a
microfiber towel just going to
get all the dust and dirt off
now I have a nice sharp clean razor
blade on one of these little flat blade
holders and essentially what you're
going to do is just going to start
scraping
away if you've gotten rid of all the
dust and dirt Your Glass isn't going to
scratch you can start
to scrape it away with the flat blade
and then also
peel the sticker away
sometimes if
you scrape as you're going or scrape and
pull as you're going you can eliminate
some of the the glue being left
behind you just want to be careful that
you don't slip and go into the body or
the painted surface
either so generally on the edges you
want to go kind of
slow all right so I've removed several
stickers now you have all this glue left
on and uh if you leave it dust and dirt
will stick to it you might see that on
some of some of the other cars on the on
the roadway but what I have here is a
goon um dissolve it any of those other
products will work what we want to do is
just spray on the
Goan and you can let it set or you can
scrape it as well with a flat blade and
you can see all the adhesiv all the
adhesive starting to gum up and be
removed
all right it's looking pretty good all
right so now we got to get all this uh
goog on and adhesive off so I use the
glass cleaner
spring it
again and the microfiber or any any
other towel lintree
preferred you can see how clean it looks
um there's a couple spots I'm going to
go back and hit uh after the video and
remove the rest of them as well and time
to renew and replace all of them so
thanks for watching
