isn't it frustrating when you see that
it's raining outside and you haven't
brought your cushions in so you start
screwing around and try to do it in real
big hurry so they don't get wet well you
don't have to do that with ours
there's a lot of fabric out there that's
what they call water-resistant ours is
waterproof check this out so the rain
goes on the cushion and you can let it
sit there for as long as you wish it
will penetrate through just the top but
it'll never actually hit the cushion
itself inside and because of that it
dries very very quickly so within just a
few seconds you're able to sit on it and
it has a guarantee against mildew and
mold so talk about the perfect type of
fabric for your outdoor living space
