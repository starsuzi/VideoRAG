so there's always a lot of question on
what particular dyes to use for tie dye
there's quite a variety available
depending where you live in the world uh
today we're going to take a look at uh
three basic types got an off-the-shelf
tie-dye kit available you know anywhere
Walmarts uh craft stores wherever we
have a regular cold water die this is
very common product this is RIT uh this
can also represent Dion or other cold
water dyes that are available out there
and we also have a higher-end
professional die these are the proon MX
dyes and they're a little bit more
involved and a little bit pricier uh but
we will take a look at all three of
these with the same style of tie dye and
see what makes the best tie
dyes so these Rift dyes sound very
simple basically it's just dye that's
already prepackaged in a powder form
here as well as the salt which I have
added you don't necessarily have to add
the
[Applause]
salt but the the suggestion
says salt adds a deeper color and I'm
definitely into deeper
colors so basically I'm just adding this
dye now the
powder direct to the bottle with salt
and as you can
tell these are just simple Gatorade
bottles no big deal anything will work
glass mason jars whatever you got you
just want to make sure you can get
enough water in
there now they also suggest hot water as
hot as possible that is what I'm going
to go for and I'm not going to quite
fill these all the way
either I'm going about 2/3 of the
way and that's about it I'm going to mix
these up and we'll see uh what we get
out of it hope for the best
okay so the kit dyes are very easy they
suggest just adding water up until this
line but for deeper color Add Water less
than the line and that's what I'm going
to go for I'm going to go about 3/4 of
the bottle they don't speculate uh
whether it's supposed to be warm or cool
so I'm just going with uh somewhat in
between and hope for the best
always wear gloves if you can I mean
well always
can okay so we're going to shake all
this stuff up make sure all this powder
is mixed as much as possible and that's
basically all it says for this kit D for
making the dyes at
[Applause]
least that people in a People
[Music]
Choice okay so here we go
we do our rinsed these are the RIT
dyes on the
spiral I'm just going to use cool water
here and we'll start her up runoff is
not a big deal don't be worried about
runoff you're going to get some runoff
let's just Dy that has not set into the
shirt there's always going to be some I
try to keep the shirt tied up as long as
possible while I
rinse uh I'll just squeeze it out for a
while here and then I'll uh open her up
keep rinsing her and then toss her in
the washing machine we'll take a look at
that in a
sec okay so we got it rinsed up pretty
good here it's not perfect but most of
the residue is gone it hasn't stuck in
the
shirt a little bit of color still coming
out not too major we'll just take a
brief look
here yeah not too bad all right okay and
here we go now we're going to
rinse the kit D I must say I'm very
impressed with the brightness of the
color but not impressed at all with the
quantity in the bottle it's a beautiful
looking D though I must
say so let's see what she rinses like
and it's the same idea you're going to
see a little bit of runoff here I don't
want that to scare you don't be worried
everything runs off not every bit of dye
can Spa spond to the shirt so you're
going to give some run off now if that
all disappears that's kind of a bummer
I've seen that happen too but that's
pretty rare that just means you made
your dies wrong these are pre-made so
how can you go
around we'll take a look in a
minute all right so we'll take a quick
look here we runched her out pretty good
the run up stopped right away I'm very
impressed with this uh particular D but
I'm not too impressed as I said with the
quantity it's kind of a ripoff but the
colors are Beauty
there's a nice one so we'll rinse that
up and we'll take a look at her in a
bit okay well we rinsed are pretty good
here just a preliminary
rinse take a quick look see what we
[Music]
got and the winner is
not bad at all very beautiful colors you
can see how the higher end dyes do make
a big difference when it comes to
brightness
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
was broken down on the side of the road
yeah was draing in the darkness like a
king sck in the woods hiding in the Tall
Grass you are hiding in the tall grass
