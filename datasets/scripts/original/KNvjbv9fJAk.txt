hello everyone how are you today and
welcome to let's go :
today we want to show you how to make a
imitation crab meat salad it's a very
good it's a artificial crab meat they
call it imitation crab meat is the
healthiest things ever and it's very
good to eat it more often every day this
okay is fine so let's start it here what
I have here the crab meat here so they
all become like in the chunks like this
is this flat so all what you need just
either slice them quick or you can use
your hand to separate it and make a
little flaky like this here you go
and voila give it extra chop now let's
get our mixing bowl pour it in and don't
be afraid to use your hand to separate
them make them blow flaky like this it's
nice this is very good meal very good
healthy solution well ah there we go now
let's do some chopping to it here so
firstly because let me add the dressings
for it here so I have a 2 tbsp of
mayonnaise and I have here about half a
teaspoon of allspice
we'll put it and I need some lemon
let me have some lemon zest into the
crabmeat salad here give it a nice
flavor nice there we go now let me use
the lemon juice
it's a weird way of squeezing lemon
don't use it watch your hand and now
it's time to chop our vegetable I have
some the red onion now for the vegetable
in the crabmeat salad you don't have to
worry about you can put as much as you
want because some people they like water
vegetables some people mess vegetable
the more vegetable the better it is
because you add more fiber to your meal
there we go
and I want to add a little bit red
pepper a few green pepper put a little
bit extra beans after just give the
color as well there we go that's a
little carrot as well now let's mix it
and when you're mixing you always salt
and pepper just for the sake don't add a
lot the spaces first and then if you
need a little bit more you can put more
but the imitation crabmeat salad usually
take a little bit more pepper
voila
there we go now let's plated it now what
I'm going to use I'm using the the
spring mix here which is or if you have
any regular salad it's fine to use but
me I'm just using spring mix I have it
available here we go now just the flavor
of your salad a little bit more just
coupler drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette
a little bit of olive oil perfect
and now let's place the crab meat salad
in the middle here
no I see you go it's a very healthy meal
very high in nutrition and I will
suggest this meal to eat it at least
twice a week you'll get to go you're
