hello fellow YouTubers bear prepper here
today I was just making up some laundry
soap and as you know it's a one bar of
Zoda soap melted in hot
water pour it in your bucket
and then of course your one cup of
uh one and 1/2 cups of washing soda to
one cup of
forx but I wanted to show you today is
how to make fabric
softener so let me stop that and let me
show you
so fabric softener is really easy you
take one gallon of vinegar and I got a
fresh bottle of vinegar
here and you take some fragrance
oil you can use these little packages if
you use these little packages you want
to use the whole thing so in one of
these packages it's a half a fluid ounce
if you're going to use the large
ones then you still want to use half a
fluid ounce there's 8 oz in here I'm
probably going to put 1
oz in there and all you do is you take
your fragrance oil can you see that
probably not let me move this up a
little
bit and you just pour
in half an ounce of fragrance
oil now shake it up and get it all mixed
up I know you're thinking e everything's
going to smell like vinegar well if you
take the cap off yeah it smells like
vinegar but when you put it in your
laundry you can't smell the vinegar and
all you smell is the wonderful fragrance
that you put in there and it works
absolutely wonderful between the
anti-static and cleanliness of your
homemade soap and the vinegar fabric
softener and just put it in your fabric
thing or your fabric ball or whatever
you want to put it in or you can take
and um cut little pieces of towel soak
it in let it dry throw it in your dry
Works wonderful it's great on static if
you have lots of dogs like I do it takes
the dog hair off your clothes so give it
a shot I hope you like it
vinegar and a half an ounce of
fragrance blessings
