We will learn how to grow chilli from seeds till end so watch the complete videos
 
Here I have taken cocopeat and compost ( in ratio of 1:1)
 
Seed germination and root development takes place very well in cocopeat.
 
 
I bought these seeds from the market you can also use dry chilli seeds found in your kitchen
 
I have cut a seedling tray in small sections to grow seedlings. In this tray we have 6 cells , hence i will plant 6 seeds.
I will cover the seeds with a thin layer of the potting mix.
 
After 5 days 5 out of 6 seeds have already germinated . I am very happy
Now I will shift these seedlings to complete sunlight!
 
Almost 1 moth has passed and I am going to transplant my plants in a bigger pot
 
I have taken 40% garden soil 30% compost and 30% cocopeat
 
I will transplant the plant in a 10 inch pot
Be very careful while transplanting the plant , you dont want to damage any roots.
 
After transplanting the plant add 1 teaspoon of epsom salt
now water the plant and keEP it in shade till new growth appears
Do water the plant regularly
After almost 25 days the plant has begin to flower , now I will add 1 and half tspoon of bonemeal.
 
Bonemeal has calcium and phosphorus which is very good for chilli plants
 
This is the second chilli of this plant , I couldnt film the first chilli as I overlooked it
After about 15 days the green chillie turns red like thi
 
 
This is my second chillie plant also grown from seed.
I have kept these plants in full sunlight
It is very easy to grow chillie from seeds but it takes a lot of time,  so be patient and you will get amazing results
Keep the soil porous and add bonemeal (bimonthly) and epsom salt (once a month)
