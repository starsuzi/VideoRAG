hi this is Boon stew and today I'm going
to show you a surprise
Discovery in my container of
oatmeal I usually have oatmeal for
breakfast and I leave a
small coffee cup inside for measuring
out a scoop of
coffee so when I went to look at it this
morning what do I
find what
four meal
weevils well it turns out that this is a
perfect trap for them they don't seem to
be able to get out of it I don't know
how they got into
it they would have to have uh climbed up
the size of that
cup so I'm just going to dump them out I
guess they're protein they won't do any
damage they don't look so great but
I'm not worried about them and so if you
want to catch or even see if you've got
any wevs in any container just leave a
cup like I did in that and like magic
you'll catch
them have a good day
