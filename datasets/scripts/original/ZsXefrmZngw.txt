Hey There YouTube this is going to be a
tutorial or hopefully if it's
successful way to remove Silly Putty
from your carpet as you can see it's a
pretty big
stain I just recently yesterday actually
got professionally clean carpet so all
of my carpet is clean but this spot they
recommended that I cut out a patch or
whatever and then they were going to fix
it but I said that I was going to try to
take it out with alcohol 91% alcohol if
you have it or if not buy it it's like
70 I'm using cotton balls which this
would work if you had a smaller
stain and soapy water and a
rag
okay so what I'm going to do is get a
coton
ball put the alcohol to
it because if you put the cotton to the
alcohol thing you're going to
contaminate it then on your wound you're
going to have silly putty on it so you
don't want to do that so I'm going to do
a small area right here so y'all can see
if it works or
not now I'm rubbing it in a small circle
but I don't think it really matters
which or how what method you use to take
it out I'm going to do the up and down
one
[Music]
and you see it coming out
actually
see see how it comes
up so maybe if I
put a little bit of
will so be water on
it it will come
up and it
did
okay so you're going to try to do that
for the rest of the same and I hope this
helped especially with those who
love Silly Putty just as much as these
kids
do and if you want to make it into a
family activity have them do it thank
you YouTube and I hope everything works
out
