well good day everybody it's Phil from
the High Desert Garden back with another
video and today I'm going to show you
guys how to plant some oregano now you
can grow it from seed I don't have any
what I do have is I have some oregano
cuting that were purchased from the
store so I'm going to be growing those
um I've already got some that I've stuck
in uh some cuting that I stuck in water
and they started to root anyways I'm
going to bring you guys in close so you
can see how I'm going to do this all
right so here are the cuting that I've
stuck in some water and I've already got
some Roots
growing this uh taller one has been in
the water for about a week and so this
one has roots these two I decided to
plant more so I I grabbed these two out
of the fridge and I threw them in here
and they've had a chance to sort of perk
up a little bit um granted keep in mind
they were in the fridge for a week so uh
I think they're still going to be fine
but if you know if one or two die it's
not a big deal this one again has roots
has been in the water for about a week
this is another one that I just threw in
here today and it's starting to perk up
a little bit so I do recommend putting
these in some water uh so that they can
at least have a drink or have a chance
to grow some Roots before you plant them
up
so I'm going to take these I'm going to
plant them in here all right so this is
pretty moisted soil it's just been
sitting here for a while um now for the
the two that have the roots I'm
literally going to stick my finger down
in here nice and deep so I want a nice
big
hole so I want to make sure I'm able to
get those roots in there all right take
your
cutting again look at those roots it's
got some nice Roots
there oh it's latched onto a smaller
cutting let me unlatch
it there you go look at those look at
those roots It's Got
Roots uh by the way I should have
removed some more of these leaves don't
know why I didn't
so that's one of the things is when you
are planting these especially if they
don't have Roots you want to remove most
of the
leaves for the best chance of success so
you're just going to put it right in
that
hole and you're going to fill it
in very loose soil you don't have to
pack it tightly or anything so there
that one's
done you're going to want to make sure
you water it in really well to get rid
of any air
pockets um so here comes the
other and again this is just one week
and some
water this one's getting planted
deeper that actually makes me happy I
like
that so the deeper that you plant it
the less you have above the soil the
less stress it's going to be on the
cutting all right this little one might
actually outgrow this bigger one
okay all right so now we're going to do
a couple of
these these cuting that
have no roots
yet and these are the ones that's kind
of eh iffy you know as to whether or
not they're going to make
it you can just take a pen or what
pencil whatever you have shove it down
in your soil make a
hole
and we got some Peete Moss here and put
it in there there best you can uh if
you're wanting to know how I made this
soil watch my other video on growing
your plants to their genetic Potential
from a Seedling I show you how I make my
potting mix and you don't strictly have
to go by that in fact in this potting
mix I actually added a bit more uh
Vermiculite for better irration than I
usually
do I also added some sand to this
soil so experiment a little bit play
around a little bit and
uh you'll you'll figure out what works
for you so there you have it again I'm
going to water this in really well and
I'll keep it nice and uh moist for the
next couple weeks as these establish
roots and these
grow thank you guys so much for watching
