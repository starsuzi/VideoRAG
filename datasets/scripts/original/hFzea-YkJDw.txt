hey guys how's it going
work work work here
you know uh
i
listen to these uh
radio shows and things like that
periodically
and
i've always been
i always pick things up off those that
are interesting i've always
that and i've always been interested in
the psychology of things i shouldn't
maybe i was missing my call and i should
have been a psychiatrist or a
psychologist or something
on those lines i'm probably pretty good
at it because i've always been curious
you know i always talk about
uh
what people are up to
and i've always been good at you know i
tell people
i say
if you want to know what somebody's
going to do you need to know what
they're thinking
and you know what their thought process
is you know what's in their head
i've always been good at kind of
i guess i guess some people call it
being pragmatic so we call it being nosy
i don't know but that
you know i was
i'm just trying to be
it's kind of what's going on with people
and uh
if you do that you always predict what
they're they're gonna do normally
so i guess i would have been good at
that line of work but i'm always into
psychology and people's thinking and
that kind of stuff and one thing that i
heard on a radio show one time they were
interviewing this lady
and she was uh
she's pretty well known
psychiatrist psychologist or something
like that counselor saw on those lines
but
she digs in people's heads and
she said something that i think is one
of the most accurate statements that
i've ever heard somebody
say
and what it was she was talking she said
you know people tend to be in love with
the idea of things
and what that means is i know it sounds
a little strange but what that means is
it means that people
and it doesn't mean everybody but a
certain segment of people
tend to be
really in the thinking of things
thinking of ideas thinking about doing
things
and developing ideas
and
that's fine you know that's wrong with
that but that's who they are and
you know
the problem is when it comes down to
putting those ideas into
uh implementing them and putting them in
operation you know they're kind of
i don't know now you know i just
don't like that part too well
so
i think that that applies to the car
hobby you know that's why so many people
have
uh
so many people has come back here in the
back so i can keep on working while i'm
talking but some people have failed at
working on old cars and fixing them up
and things like that
relocate here
oh
so
so many people failed at that
and
i think what happens is
people tend to
get into
old cars and stuff and working on them
and
all that and
oh hang on a second
oh sorry about that i had a little issue
here i had to work out
um
anyway people you know guys they get
these old cars and trucks whatever
they're fixing up
and they're all gung-ho about it first
and they
you know even if something's a rust
bucket or whatever
they
just oh man gonna fix this thing up
we're gonna
work on it
no problem man we're gonna go through
this thing and do everything to it
you know
and then
after a period of months you know you
just see the
level of interest and activity just
start nose diving
and
then
end all that they may have the thing
partially taken apart
and it's like they'll come up with some
of those excuses that people always come
up with so well i just
i just realized i just don't have time
or you know i got three kids and three
jobs and i just gotta do this and i'm
trying to start a business and
yeah excuse it's we
know it's but what happens is
these guys you know they get in love
with the idea of doing a car restoration
but they
don't think about the part or they're
not interested in the part where you
actually gotta work on it
and we've always we've all been in there
in that situation at some point
you know i've had my own projects that
i've had that i have
started on and then
abandoned
and that's probably the case there i'm
busy i'm as
you know guilty zombies i started on
whatever it was
and i got into it i thought well you
know
this just didn't mean fun anymore i'm
not having fun with this i don't want to
keep working on it so the way it went
and that's what happens but that's i
think that's a lot of a lot of guys that
you know especially the ones that have
never fooled cars before
and they uh
you know they have you know there's
nothing wrong with guys having big
dreams and hopes you know that's what
makes things
work sometimes but
you know you have to
you have to realize
that
even if you're in love with the idea of
doing something
fascinated with you know
taking an old car truck that's in bad
shape and restoring it
you need to realize it's a hell of a lot
of work it's a hell of a lot of work and
it's a lot of money it's a lot of time
and i tell people when i respond to
these guys that are on these forums and
they're the same old they say
you know i just don't have the time and
this don't happen you should've known
that you should've known that before you
got even got started
and you know you can see my stuff i've
got here i just drag and drag and drag
this because
it's not by my own design
it is up to me i wouldn't have to work
and i would
have a big shop with three bays in it
and all the power tools and all that
plenty of time plenty of room and plenty
of money to do all of it i could just do
whatever but
i have to
work within the constraints that i have
here some by my own design probably most
by my own design you know i've tried to
avoid going in debt
and
you know
in so much as i've wanted to stay out of
debt i've not bought a house
and
i've put that off a long time and so
but down the road you know i've got to
myself i've got to decide for myself
you know
40 43 years old is not that young
anymore and i've got to decide for
myself how do i want to live whatever
time i've got left you know
you don't want to be doing it
in a
crap hole of a rental house with a
single car garage in a single driveway
or do what i want to do so
but
you know that's the thing when you when
you're going to fix something up an old
car or truck or tractor
be in it to win it you know
don't get this involved just don't get
in just in love with the idea of it
and then
you get started on it and you
pick out a little bit and you run as
well this sucks i actually have to do it
you got to actually do it
it's like my buddy up there in
albertville
and some of you that have
uh
watched my channel for a long time
remember i had a 66 catalina for a while
and
uh
my buddy there
he was just
in love with that car you know when he
was gonna
he was gonna restore it
and all that and so
i essentially made him a deal i took in
that um
pala that caprice which
i never did anything with that there's
there's that so
you know like i said i'm just guilty as
anybody but
anyway so
uh
so basically
he got that catalina for nothing and he
had a nice
pretty big garage and everything and he
had
that's the thing that just just gauged
you to death
he had just about everything it needed
he needed to fix the car up up there had
air compressors air tools
two you know air hold down yard welder
and everything he had everything he
needed to do that except motivation
and
i think that was all he liked he had
weekends pretty much free had a kid and
a wife
but you know you can work around those
if you have a healthy marriage you don't
have to sit there and entertain your
wife all damn weekend
just don't think you do but
so anyway so he he had that car for a
while and he added a couple years i
guess and he started out gung-ho he
started out the same damn mistake that
guys make so many times
they think the first thing they need to
do since they're going to do a frame off
restoration they've never done a
freightoff restoration they don't have
any
experience at it but they're gonna do
one
so that's the first thing he did
stripped every last piece off that car
except the fenders
got the glass out of it got the interior
out of it left the interior out in the
rain so it got ruined well of course you
know it's gonna get new interiors that
doesn't matter
and
you know
for all the good points the guy has good
family man i'm telling you what he
didn't need to restore cars because he
just abandoned you know same stuff well
i'm gonna do it yeah i'm gonna get back
when they start saying i need to get
back out there and do it that tells me
like i said you need to take how people
think
you need to watch what
watch
don't listen what they're telling you
read between the lines when they say
and they say i need to get out there and
do it
and what they're saying is i don't want
to get out there and do it i don't want
to get out there and work on it i've had
my fun i was in love with the idea of
doing this but now that i actually got
to work on the i'm not interested
in it now i want to do something else
let me go look let me go look at
craigslist to buy another car that's
what's going to satisfy me right now
i don't want turn wrenches
to be honest about it don't
don't screw around with it don't kid
yourself don't get other people
and he's he went on for the longest time
oh yeah we're gonna do that yeah we're
gonna
i gotta line somebody up to paint it i
gotta yeah i gotta get this rust fixed
out here and
i don't know where that car went i don't
know if he sold it in one piece or
scrapped it or what he did i tell you
what i knew this much
when he was unable to rebuild a
two-barrel rochester carburetor
when he was unable to do that i said
this this ain't going nowhere
this thing ain't never going to get off
the ground i said i have just ruined the
66 catalina by giving it to him
and you know i know there's
rationalizers on the internet to say
well you know
what people's situation is just you know
maybe he just
maybe they just uh
you know wanted to do something
different
that's fine but
don't figure that's crap out after
you've got the damn thing taken apart
you know
so be realistic about it you know
it's the first of these things i do i
want to spend
hours and hours and hours under it
it was dirt my face grinding the bottom
of the car off of the grinder do i want
to be torching bolts off do i want to be
sanding rust do i want to be
doing this do i want to be doing that or
do i want to be sitting on my big ass in
front of the computer looking at
craigslist for cars to buy and then get
out here and sell them what do you want
to do you know
don't kid yourself if you're not a car
restorer don't even attempt it don't
attempt it just let somebody pass it on
to somebody else that's going to do it
you know
i believe quite frankly i don't know
that i'm a car restorer i mean i'll fix
them up and
you know get them going again and stuff
but
my track record on doing paint and body
work and stuff like that ain't too good
right now so we'll see
we'll see if i do it i mean maybe i
won't maybe i'll continue to always have
cars that
are always a little bit rusty and all
just a little bit dented
and stuff like that
i don't know but i'm trying to be as
rational and honest about it as i
possibly can
so
no more even from me
see you guys have a good thanks for
watching
