So you're in the mall. Your baby has a teether
and they drop it on the ground. What are you
going to do now? You really only have one
maybe two with you. You give them the clean
teether they drop that one too. You don't
want to give the baby the teether that?s been
on the floor in the mall because ewe that's
gross and all those germs. So you need to
be prepared to clean your teether. So a couple
different ways to do that. I like the unscented,
alcohol free ones. This one happens to be
flushable too which is great. So you're just
going to take your wipe out and you're just
going to wipe really well all the different
parts of the toy and just make sure that you
get all the parts, especially if it fell on
the floor in the mall or somewhere where there's
lots of people walking because you just never
know what's on their shoes. Just wipe it off
really really well before giving it back to
baby. Once it's clean you can just give it
back to the baby to play with. Another way
to clean your baby's toys and some kind of
antibacterial. I like the ones that are alcohol
free. There aren't very many on them on the
market but especially when you're thinking
about the fact that this is going to go in
baby's mouth you just want to try and find
one that has no alcohol in it. I like this
one because it's fairly natural. It's called
germs zapper and this is a foam so you're
going to just squirt out a little bit of foam
into your hand and then take the toy and rub
it all over the toy again making sure you
get all the different parts. This one's nice
because it kills bacterial for up to four
hours. So nice and clean and then you can
give it to baby and if you want to you can
also wipe it off with your burp cloth or something
like that but this is a great way to quick
clean your toys that drop on the ground before
you give them back to baby
