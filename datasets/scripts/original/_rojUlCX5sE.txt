back today we're in my kitchen because
we're going to be making some
s'mores with the ingredients in the set
you can make 10 mini
s'mores don't these look absolutely
delicious oh my gosh I love
s'mores all right let's get this open
and see what exactly comes inside the
box now this set retails for about $20
and you can buy it at like Walmart or
Toys R Us or I even think amazon.com has
the
[Music]
set so here's what you get inside of the
Box they give you a little Yummy Nummies
plastic
tray this is a spatula and they call
this a campfire
spatula a mixing spoon love the little
fire on top so
cute this is a measuring
scoop two packets of the graham cracker
mix one packet full of the chocolate
mix another packet full of marshmallow
mix your own personal
campfire this is just so so cute now
this does need batteries it does not
come with batteries and so it needs
three
aaa's let's try this out and I just want
to warn you this is probably the only
time where you're ever allowed to stick
your hand into the
fire oh look it I love how it looks like
fire look it's flickering like fire I
love
that
cool these little buttons here on top
are for the marshmallow and chocolate
we're going to use them to squirt the
marshmallow chocolate onto our gram
cracker lastly are some instructions on
how to make your
s'mores in addition to the set you're
also going to need to provide some
water and a pair of
scissors all right so let's get started
the first step is to cut out this little
tiny tray out of the large your plastic
tray now we're going to use the L-shaped
tray open up the packet of graham
cracker
mix I'll put in eight round scoops of
the mix into tray number
one I'll also add 1 and 1/2 Square
scoops of water to the mix
now we'll just give this a little mixy
Mixie and you know what it's been a long

watching all right now we're going to
divide up the graham cracker mix into
these four
[Music]
[Music]
trays
[Music]
this is now going to go into your
microwave for 10
seconds all right we're not done cooking
it we have to take all of these little
squares out flip them over and then
we're going to put them back into the
microwave for another 10
[Music]
seconds
[Music]
these are finally done so I'll just set
these aside and now I'm going to make up
the
chocolate I'll open up the chocolate
packet put in four round scoops of the
chocolate
mix
and also add 2 and 1/2 Square scoops of
water I'm going to mix everything up
really really
good until it looks like dark delicious
chocolate now I also need to make the
marshmallow
mix in this last tray I'll also put in
four round scooops of the marshmallow
[Music]
[Music]
mix I'll also mix this one really really
good
until it looks like
marshmallow well more of like a liquidy
marshmallow now it's time to add some
fire I'll just carefully take the top
off of the fire scoop in some of the
marshmallow mix here on the
left add some of the chocolate on the
right
[Music]
H I may have filled this up too much but
that is what that should look
like I'll carefully slip the top back on
to our
fire now it's time to make our s'mores
I'll put one of the ground cracker
pieces on the spatula and then slip it
right into the fire
I'll press the marshmallow button so the
marshmallow will come out onto my ground
cracker oh you can see
it and then we'll add some
chocolate I think they're getting just
mixed together
inside now we'll just take it
out doesn't quite look like a s'more but
we'll add the top piece of the gram
cracker anyway
I can't wait to see how this
tastes all right so let's see how this
tastes it sure does smell
good oh it's so
gooey wow that is actually really good
you know it's a little light on the
marshmallow but I think I'm okay with
that the graham cracker tastes a lot
like the crust of like an apple crisp
has a touch of cinnamon inside the
chocolate is really good I love how it's
gooey and I could barely taste the
marshmallow but you can definitely taste
the sweetness of the
marshmallow I actually really like this
one it's
good
