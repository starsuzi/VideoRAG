being a pretty aggressive plant in the
garden so
I tend to grow in containers. A 12 inch
to an 18 inch or even a 24 inch pot for one
plant
is actually fine, you could put a few
annuals into
decorate the pot if you'd like, but it
will eventually overtake the entire pot.
Now it's a hardy perennial here in
Central Texas
we can cut mint all year long. It grows
really well in partial shade or filtered
light,
you can grow in full sun if you give it
a little extra water.
It even grows in ponds, so it is well adapted
for most areas. Now mint
likes to be fed regularly
give it some seaweed some fish martian
in part it up in a well-drained
potting soil I really like to choose
named varieties and men like chocolate
manner double manner Kentucky Colonel
spearmint
in Egyptian is another favorite of mine
the
named varieties to have a better little
bit better flavor
smell it before you buy it to make sure
it's what you want
trim it frequently to keep it in the
optimal health
you can cut just the tips out or you can
cut long stems
right now your kitchen so you get it so
you use it really often
one official notice with meant is it has
stems that are square
and the leaves are opposite and that's
true of all the men's
bees like the blooms but I do like to
cut it back before those planes have a
chance to go to seed to keep it really
healthy
you can a given load compost and
fertilize it after you cut it back to
the ground
and that'll keep it in good shape but
every once in a while you're going have
to just empty that part out because
it'll be a massive roots in you'll need
to start over again with another man
plant you can cut men in bunches and
hang it to dry just
did time together with the rubber band
or you can drive mint sprigs in a
dehydrator tip for use in
tease all winter long if you don't have
a food dehydrator you can still dry
meant quite easily
just cut the tops of %uh the meant and
are stripped the leaves from the stems
and put them on a cookie sheet or a tray
and put them in a cool place that's dark
and well ventilated stir them up every
couple days
and when they're really nice and crispy
then you can put them in a jar but you
wanna make sure they're very very dry
because they're mildew
if they have anymore stir at all and
then you'll have plenty of meant for
future use
you can use men and smoothies and
vegetables and fruit salads and tease
and I like to just cut meant like this
and put it in bases
and use it indoors when I'm having
people over for drinks and they can
garnish the drinks with the men to their
choice
ladybugs love meant in they'll lay their
eggs on it
some other pests that our problem with
mint would be snails
worms sometimes young caterpillars will
attack your meant
but other than that it's really pretty
care free and easy to grow
I'm meant is easy to root
and you can just cut the a pistear
movement
and cut some other lower leaves of you
need to reduce the number of leaves that
the plan
as a to in order to get it to produce
roots
and then you can reap this cutting in
water or you can just bought it up in a
pod
and you'll have meant growing before too
long and you can share with your friends
for backyard basics I'm Tricia sorry
thanks for watching
