we're Celera commies fleas he's letting
me soap him up with Dawn dishwashing
liquid
beautiful face now so close do you know
it's focusing mm-hmm
I wonder if he'll get in the water and
let me get it the soap off or if I'm
going to have to just take another cloth
and do it dawn to get the lather going
more yeah
is it tired a little snap
this is what we got in my camera
get into many clothes soaps aren't you
should have brought the bottle in here
to reapply this soap
you're such a good kitty
come around this way it is you got to
stand up Jeremy
the fiddly
Thank You Joel wit but are you getting
the whole cat in the picture and to find
the flea comb now let's try it
combing it out for babies
seriously like infamous scoot back
let's stick him in the kitchens so much
for like a water they're gonna put turn
it off mm-hmm he's not so scared now
that he's getting dry wish it was easier
to give a kidney a bath
right here see the dead flea
there's one that is Paul see the dead
flea can you get it Jeremy right there
our sorry till the flues and the kitchen
chef Eric
okay I'll get it to flake on me home him
out and dry them up so sorry auric but
dumb fleas were killing you
do you see a brush or a flake oh no it's
a plastic one plastic does a good amount
of them are dead but if you look on the
face all the plays are running to the
face and put some more dawn on the wash
rag you know this open up his little
face
look at that flea right there just I
want to prevent it from going in his
what-do-you-call-it
eyes but it seems to be the lather that
kills the fleas so if you can lather
them up really good and then the hard
part is getting the lather off as you
saw in the kitchen sink in there with
this poor little wild baby
it was so ate up with fleas he's willing
to do anything to see that live one
right there
this doesn't kill them all 100% so you
have to keep doing it for a little bit
and it doesn't um repel fleas so they
have a good chance of getting them back
again let's see if we can wipe the foam
off with the side
this is the safest way I know to do it
to for now in the future I'm going to
try diet just neisha certh and see if it
works
the deftly on his nose is definitely
good
this poor little guy has been through a
lot he showed up billiard or starving to
death about toon week two and a half
weeks ago and then he disappeared three
days ago and then showed up about eight
hours ago in starvation mode again we
have no clue what happened to him but so
far it's been eight hours in the house
and we're going to do everything we can
to save this little guy and keep him and
make him happy and healthy this is the
end of this flee saga for now but it
looks like it's working
if I had my flake home um I would be
able to just comb some fleas out of here
but all I have right now is the brush
we'll keep you updated thanks for
watching
you
