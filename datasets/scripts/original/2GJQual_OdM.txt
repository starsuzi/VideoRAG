- These brown sugar,
cinnamon, oatmeal bites
are incredibly simple to make,
and they are small bites of warm oats
with a sprinkle of brown sugar.
They're the perfect on-the-go snack.
(upbeat, melodic music)
(snappy, playful music)
I don't know about you, but
my mornings are super rushed.
Whether it's packing lunches,
getting everything inside of backpacks,
or getting the kids ready,
it can be almost impossible
to grab something to eat
before everyone is off to their day.
And yes, this includes myself.
I hate to admit it, but
some mornings are so hectic
that I forget about eating.
A total tragedy, because
these oatmeal bites
are just the thing I often make,
and thanks to Quaker Oats,
our partner for today's video,
I'm gonna share one of my
favorite morning options.
I love using Quaker Oats
as part of my breakfast
and in recipes like this one,
because their oat flakes
are large, high in quality,
nutritious, and of course their taste.
They make these brown sugar,
cinnamon, oatmeal bites
both delicious and something
I feel great about eating,
specially on the busiest of days,
when it can be so easy to revert
to less nutritious options,
or worse, skip eating altogether.
First I'm gonna preheat the oven to 375
and lightly spray a 24
count mini muffin pan
with cooking spray.
Let's set that aside
and start on the oats.
In this bowl I'm going to combine my oats,
some baking powder,
cinnamon and a dash of salt.
I also love how oats are highly versatile,
offering countless possibilities
so you get nutrition and taste
from the recipes we enjoy each day.
Like baked oatmeal or many
overnight oats recipes.
Now let's add the milk,
eggs, and a little vanilla.
Now you just wanna whisk this
to combine, right in the bowl.
Now using a large spoon,
I'm going to fill the mini
muffin cups with the oat mixture,
all the way to the top.
I also use oats to make
other delicious snacks
like granola bars and banana oat muffins,
because a half cup serving of raw oats
is a good source of fiber
and they contain important
vitamins and minerals
our bodies need.
Now before I place them in the oven,
I'm gonna sprinkle each mini muffin
with a little brown sugar.
This will make these warm, soft
cinnamon oat bites even tastier.
Into the oven they go for 22 minutes,
until the tops are light brown
and the muffins have completely set.
If you make these in the afternoon,
this is the part where you
can get everyone started
with their homework and brew
yourself a cup of coffee,
and before you know it
they are ready to come out of the oven.
And boy do these smell amazing!
That sprinkle of brown
sugar and the cinnamon
combined with toasty oats, never gets old.
In just a couple of minutes,
once they've cooled down
to room temperature,
they're ready to be enjoyed.
Once cooled, they are perfect to be packed
inside a reusable bag
and they are perfect
for an on-the-go snack.
You'll find the recipe for these bites
in the description box right below.
