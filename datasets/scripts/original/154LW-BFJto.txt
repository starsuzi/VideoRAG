Hey Cookaholics chef Kendra here and today
we're making a clone type deal from the American
fast food restaurant, Steak n Shake.
I'm not claiming any authenticity it's just
my take on it.
Alright, lets do what we do.
Head to the kitchen and make it happen.
Steak n Shake is known for all they're crazy
milkshake combos which is to me is my favorite
reason to go.
However, I'll save that for the summer.
Right now let's make our sandwich.
You saw me slice some onion because we are
going to caramelize these boys like a boss.
We have our non stick pan under medium heat
with couple Tablespoons of vegetable oil.
We're going to cook these on low for about
35 40 minutes.
Nope, not quick but straight up worth it.
Now we're just going to set them aside.
Wipe down our pan.
Now for our sauce.
Two part Russian dressing and one part American
French Dressing.
We're just going to mix it up and toss in
the fridge until we're ready to put this boy
together.
Now we're going to season our beef with salt
and pepper and get it mixed up with clean
hands.
Now after we've done that we're going to shape
them into two patties, then slide them on
some parchment and place in the freezer for
20 minutes.
We're going to butter both side of our sour
dough bread and pan toast these boys.
We're going to brown both sides.
Then we're going our bread aside.
For me this sandwich is all about the caramelized
onions, I can eat a whole bowl of that goodness
all by itself.
OK, we're sliding in one of our patties and
it's going to shrink up on us, but that's
OK, flip it .
Now we're going to at a slice of our cheese
cover the pan after about 30 seconds turn
off the heat.
Repeat with other piece of beef and slice
of cheese.
Let's put this bad boy together.
The restaurant only puts sauce on one slice
of bread.
No, man we need sauce on both sides.
Drop down our caramelized onions, just like
so.
The American cheese patty goes next.
And finally our Swiss cheese patty goes down.
Let's cover up our masterpiece.
Look at that.
Heck yeah.
That's all it is to it.
