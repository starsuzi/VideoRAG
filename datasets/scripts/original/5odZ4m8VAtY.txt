Hi and welcome to Bold Baking Basics, this
is where we get into the fundamentals of baking.
These videos are about getting you to bake
with confidence, anytime, anywhere.
So praline is a really popular treat around
the holiday season and although it is caramel
based it is actually really easy to make.
The recipe can be found on BiggerBolderBaking.com
along with all of my other recipes.
Okay let�s get started with our first step.
So for this praline I'm using slivered almonds,
you can also use whole almonds.
And a great thing about this recipe is you
can actually use any nut that you like.
What we�re going to do now is scatter these
on our tray.
So what we�re gonna do now is pop these
into the oven at 350�F/180�C for roughly
8-10 minutes or until they get nice and toasty.
Toasted nuts are so aromatic and it makes
a huge difference to your praline.
So I'm gonna set those aside and let them
cool down.
Now before we get started with our caramel,
here I have a tray lined with parchment paper.
And I put some butter on it and we�re gonna
pour our praline straight onto this and with
the butter it won�t stick.
I'm gonna put this right beside me because
when the praline is ready it�s gonna go
straight onto there.
Okay I've got everything I need, now let�s
start making our caramel.
Into a heavy bottomed saucepan add in your
sugar, and a little bit of water.
Then turn on the heat to around a medium,
medium low, until your sugar dissolves.
At this point you can stir your sugar until
it dissolves.
So praline is based on caramel which some
people can be a bit nervous about making,
I've got a video about troubleshooting caramel,
it tells you what to do, and what not to do.
It�s really really easy to follow, if you
watch that video you'll be able to make praline,
no problem.
So it�s really important for your sugar
to dissolve before you allow it to simmer
and I�ll tell you why.
When making praline it sometimes can be a
little bit grainy, and that is because the
sugar wasn't fully dissolved before you simmered
it.
So just make note of that.
So I can tell by looking at it that our sugar
is dissolved, this is the perfect time to
let it come to a simmer.
Okay so now this next step is the waiting
game.
You're not gonna touch the heat you're just
gonna let it sit there, and continue to bubble
away very gently until it reaches a lovely
amber color.
The timing of this step does vary because
caramel does take quite a long time to make,
so it�ll take around 15 minutes or so.
So a really important thing when making caramel
is to be patient, let it just bubble away
and do its thing, what you can�t do however
is walk away, you always want to be close
by keeping an eye on it, because it can turn
pretty fast.
So we�ve just reached the color that I want,
this is perfect, so I'm going to add in my
butter, and my toasted almonds.
And then just give that all a stir up together,
coating all those nuts.
So once it�s all mixed together, go ahead
and pour it immediately onto your prepared
tray.
Now be very careful at this point because
caramel is extremely hot, so if you need help,
ask for it.
Gorgeous.
So that�s our praline, but don�t touch
it, right now we�re gonna have to set it
aside and let it go completely cold.
So it�s been around half an hour, our praline
is completely cold so this is the fun part.
Get something nice and heavy, and then just
bash it up into little pieces.
Little or big, whatever you want.
So one of the reason praline is so popular
around the holiday season is that it makes
great gifts.
You can make it 4 weeks in advance, keep it
out at room temperature in an airtight container
and then you can just hand it out to your
friends and family.
What you don't want to do is pop it into the
fridge because it can go soft if you put it
in the fridge.
Mm, my mum absolutely adores praline and I
think that's why I love it so much.
You can make any different type you want,
you can dip it in chocolate, use different
nuts, you can even use salted nuts to add
a bit of extra flavor.
