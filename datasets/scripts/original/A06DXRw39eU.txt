hi everyone so i am so excited to show
you how to make this super cute baby
panda charm or figurine it is kind of
like too big to be a charm but too
little to be a figurine i don't really
know but this is so cute i love love
love this design and yes it is my own
original design and i do know that there
are already panda charm designs going
around on youtube but i wasn't very
happy with how my own panda charms came
out when i followed some of those
tutorials so i made a lot of
improvements and modifications to them
and this is what i came up with and so
now without further ado we can now get
started so today you will need your loom
your hook
one c-clip and as many colored bands as
you'd like however i recommend using two
colors and i recommend using white plus
one other color but you can use whatever
colors that you would like
and all my supplies today are from the
rainbow loom web store so first off we
are going to start with our looms arrows
pointing down and we do use the
staggered loom position for this or the
offset loom position so you can make
this on any loom
and so first we're going to start off
with white bands
so
um we're going to be using double bands
for this whole entire portion for now
so first you're going to start and
you're going to skip this top pin and go
to the second pin here and use double
white bands
and go diagonally
and double white bands again
diagonally the other way
and now we're basically going to make
kind of a triple single pattern but a
very
short version of it so i'm still using
double white bands for this
and we will be using double bands for
all of this unless i switch and tell you
otherwise so if i don't specify and
you're not sure then you can trust that
these are all double bands
so just going to continue on
and now at this point you're not going
to put any more on these left and right
pins here or pin bars you're going to go
ahead use double bands and go in the
middle only
so that way this uh section is longer
than the other two on the outside and
now you're going to use double white
band still and kind of close off this
figure here
like that
push your bands down and we have now
finished um part of
our baby panda's head so go ahead scoot
your loom down we're going to start on
the body now so for this next chain
you're going to use double black bands
and again still using double bands for
everything
and now we're just going to continue
using double black bands and you're
going to go outwards here
and outwards here
and then three lines of double black
bands here
like that
so now we are going to go ahead and
switch back to white bands so use double
white bands
and you're going to
make two rows of double white bands
so we are on our first row now
and here is our second row
like that
so now your loom should look like this
and we are now going to continue on and
put on some black bands down here on the
bottom so now i'm taking double lock
bands and i'm only going to put it on
this left pin bar here
and on this right pin bar here
like that
so now you're going to take a single
black band and wrap around this bottom
pin four times
so one
two
three
and four so i have four rings around
this pin here
and now you're going to do the same
thing to this pin right here so wrap a
single black band around this bottom pin
here four times
one
two
three and
four
like that so these two here are going to
be the little uh baby panda's legs now
we're going to go up to our loom to
where the shoulders are kind of here
you're going to take double black bands
here
and you're going to put them going
vertically here on above the left
shoulder
here double block bands
take double black bands again and put
them above the right shoulder
so above on this right shoulder here
now you're going to take one single
block band and you're going to wrap it
around four times around this pin here
so
one
two
three
and
four
and the same thing on this pin here
so single band here and one
two
three and four
so now we have put two cap bands on
these two pins here which are on the top
pin here above the little
vertical bands that we put going over
the shoulders
now we're going to scoot our looms up
and for now we're going to put on the
eyes that go on the panda
so you're going to take a single black
band and wrap it around four times on
this pin here that should be in the
middle of
your
two bands here so wrap it around four
times
one two three and four
push your bands down and we're going to
do one more on this pin right here so
wrap this black band one band around
this pin here
four times
one
two
three
and four
like that and push your bands down
now we are going to put on the ears of
the panda at the top of our loom you are
going to take one single black band
put it on these two except you are going
to double loop it also known as cap
bandit so put it going vertically
like that but you want to pull on it and
twist it
so that way you layer it over itself so
that way you double loop that band
take a single band again and do the same
thing on these two pins here so put it
going vertically
twist it
on top of itself so that way you have
double looped this band
and i have some broken bands here
and so now we're going to go ahead add
cap bands on here so you're going to
take a single black band and wrap around
this pin four times the very top right
pin
so one
two
three
and four
and now we're going to do the same thing
to this side here you're going to take a
single black band and wrap it around
this top left pin
four times so one
two
three
and four
like that now we're going to go ahead
and add our bands that go horizontally
so you're going to take
uh first a single white band and you're
going to start at the top of your loom
again
push your two um black uh cap bands down
and you're going to take a single white
band and put it going across these three
pins here so that way you have a
triangle here
now you're going to take another white
band
and you're going to put it across these
three pins so you have another triangle
right here
like that
scoot your loom down
you're going to go ahead and take
another white band single white band
and put across these oops these three
pins here
like that
so you have this triangle here
take another white band
and you're going to
put this band around the next three pins
below that
like that
and lastly you're going to take a single
white band but we're going to do
something a little bit different
instead of putting it across these three
pins here
you're going to go ahead and you're
going to put it across onto this top pin
but you're going to twist it around this
top pin here
and then over to this bottom right pin
so that way it goes around
an alternative way would be
to put your single white band across
these three pins here in a triangle
take your hook
take this bottom um
horizontal band here
and put it over
this pin here so now we are going to
start the hooking process and i am using
this metal hook that will be available
at the rainbow loom website starting on
march 7th 2014. or somewhere around that
date depending on whether
business gets busy around that time
so now we're going to go ahead and do
small hooking process steps so what
we're going to do is we have to hook
some of the bands inside first
so
first you're going to start in the
middle of your loom and you're going to
find this place where you have the
pandas shoulders here
you should have two cap bands on one one
on each of these two pins here
and those are the bands we are going to
hook first
so first you are going to go ahead and
take your hook and go into the right pin
here
go inside the cap band make sure you go
through all of these loops here
and you're going to kind of circle
around
and grab the band here
the double bands
so what we're trying to grab are these
bands that are right here these two
bands here so stick your hook inside
kind of circle around
and grab these bands here
pull them off of the pin
carefully
and you're going to place them
and hook them downwards which is a bit
of a more awkward hooking process
because usually in rainbow loom we hook
upwards but for this one you're going to
hook downwards onto this pin
you're going to do the same thing onto
this side go inside of this cap band
here
circle around
grab the double black bands
and pull it over the pin carefully
because this part does add quite a bit
of stress to your hook
and then you're going to set it on
to this bottom pin here
like that
push your bands down and now we're going
to scoot up to the head of our panda
and what we're going to do is we are
going to go um and what we're going to
do is take these cap bands here the two
black cap bands and we're going to slide
them over and onto this white band that
goes horizontally so we kind of cinch it
in the middle here these are the pandas
eyes so what you want to do is kind of
separate the black cap band from the
other bands and you want to take your
hook don't go inside of the pin here you
want to go on the outside especially on
the outside of this white triangular
band
use your hook and grab the black
loops that are on here it's okay if you
don't grab them all at once because you
can always pick um a couple at a time
and pull them over but you can grab them
all at once and pull them over if you'd
like
so
uh first i'll show you how to grab um
some of them so if you want to grab them
one at a time to reduce the stress on
your hook
grab them on the pin here do not go
inside of this white
white horizontal band just grab it
pull it over the pin
grab it here and just pull it over the
pin
like that
so now i will show you how to grab all
the bands at once on this left pin so
yes you are going to do the same thing
you can choose whatever technique you'd
like to use
so just separate the black bands
from the other bands do not go inside of
the white horizontal band go on the
outside
grab the black bands here make sure you
grab all of them for this technique just
pull them all over carefully
like that now we have one last thing to
do we're going to screw all the way up
to the top of our loom and we are going
to hook these two bands that are the
ears so first i'm going to start on the
right go inside of this cap band you
have here
circle around and grab this outside band
and hook it
over the pin it's okay if your cap band
falls off like mine is and you're going
to stretch it and
hook it over back onto this bottom pin
so now we're going to do the same thing
on this left side here go inside this
pin
inside the cap band
circle around grab the double looped
band pull it over the pin carefully and
stretch it downwards onto this bottom
pin here
like that
so now we are done hooking the little
small steps in our pandas so we're going
to screw all the way down to the bottom
of our loom and we can now start the
hooking process so first you're going to
take your hook and we are going to go
inside the cap band here
make sure you go inside all four layers
to grab the bottom two layers they
should be double black bands and hook
them upwards
and do the same thing on the right side
inside all four
cap band loops and grab the double bands
and hook them upwards
so now we are going to go ahead and go
inside all of the bands here
make sure you go inside this white
horizontal band stick your hook inside
grab the bottom two double white bands
and hook upwards and do the same thing
on the right side so go inside the white
horizontal band
hook the bottom two double bands and put
them upwards
now on this pin we are not going to go
inside of the bands obviously because we
don't have any bands to go inside of so
you're just going to grab all the bands
that you see here on the pin
and hook them upwards
like that
now you're going to continue on and do
this sort of triple single like figure
so go in make sure you always go inside
the horizontal band so always go inside
this band here
and hook upwards
and on the middle pins it does not apply
because you can't see the horizontal
band but
upwards
go inside the horizontal band again
grab the bottom two and hook upwards
now we're going to do the same thing
just different colors of bands we're
dealing with now
hook upwards
and go inside the horizontal band and
hook upwards again
so now we have these two bands that go
kind of upwards in sort of like an
upside down v shape so what you're going
to do is just go inside all of the bands
here be careful that um you're going
inside all of them grab the very bottom
two um double bands here they should be
black
and you're going to
pull them up and place them onto the
middle pin
push your bands down and now we're going
to go on to this very right pin here
make sure you go inside all the bands
and go to the very bottom and hook these
two black double bands here
okay so now we're going to go ahead hook
this little neck piece here make sure
you go inside all the bands here because
there are quite a bit of bands grab the
very bottom two
hook upwards
like that
so now you're going to go ahead and
you're going to grab the top two white
bands make sure you grab only the top
two and these should go to the right
now hook the next top two bands these
bands should be going to the left
and finally the last two white bands on
this pin should be going upwards
so now we have another triple single
like figure so you're going to hook make
sure you go inside of the horizontal
white band
hook upwards
hook
upwards and upwards again
and do that one last time
be careful not to let any of the band
slip off of your hook
go inside this horizontal band
and hook upwards here
so now lastly we have these two bands
that go upwards in a v shape so you're
just going to stick your hook inside the
pin go inside of this black band that is
here and grab this bottom white band
here double bands
and hook them over to this middle pin
go inside of here
grab the bottom two white bands
and hook them to the middle push your
bands down and now to finish this off we
are going to go ahead and you can either
take one or two white bands for extra
strength i'm going to use two white
bands
here and what we're going to do now is
secure our design so what you're going
to do take your double white bands and
place them on this top pin here
kind of stretch them inside here
like that
so now what you want to do is you're
going to stick your hook inside of the
middle pin and grab these bands here so
i'm going to stick my hook inside
and very carefully circle my hook around
underneath
and try to
grab these bands so
stick my hook inside
and kind of move my bands around so that
way i can see where it's easiest for me
to get those bands
and this is kind of hard to do on camera
so i might have to go off but
like that so i have grabbed these white
bands on my hook as you can see here
so you're going to grab them
and twist your hook around so that way
you can pull them pull it through all of
these pins uh bands here
like that and basically the object of
doing that is just so that way we can
get this one single chain going upwards
that holds on to all of these bands here
on our pin so now at this point if you
are not here yet go ahead and pause the
video if not go ahead and take one
c-clip here
and you're going to go ahead and slip it
onto all these bands here
all the white bands
like that
and after making sure that all your
bands are on the seat clip go ahead and
remove it carefully
and now we can remove everything off of
our loom so first i'm going to make sure
that you guys have all the same things
that i have on my loom so i will
carefully slide my loom downwards
and go ahead and pause the video at any
time if you see something that doesn't
look right or doesn't match up to your
loom and now i'm going to go ahead and
remove everything from my loom and i
will speed this part up
[Music]
[Music]
so this is hot off the loom and so what
i'm going to do now is basically kind of
pull and stretch and adjust it
so that way everything is even on my
baby panda so kind of make sure that all
the cap band loops are even and
adjusting this can do a lot to improve
the look of your charm
just simply stretching
everything out to even everything
does a lot and improves your design a
lot
so
this is what i have now
and that is pretty much it so thank you
