Hey everybody this is Sarah. Welcome back! In this video we'll be making our own
build a bear with this build a bear
workshop kit.
I found the build-a-bear workshop
stuffing station at my local Toys R Us
and they were selling it for twenty nine
dollars and ninety-nine cents.
This kit comes with two bears to stuff
but if you would like to stuff some more
they also sell some additional animals
like these. Aren't these cute?
Alright let's open this up I'm super
excited.
Believe it or not I have been to the
actual build a bear store but I haven't
built my own bear so this is pretty
exciting to see how this set will work at
home.
All right well this is probably one of
the coolest pieces of the kit.
This is your own build a bear stuffing
station.
Isn't this really cute?
The cute little teddy bear on top is a
lid that you're going to twist off and
inside comes one of the bags of the
stuffing.
Let me put the lid back on and I'll show
you the rest of the stuffing station.
Once the station is ready to go you're
just going to crank the handle here and
supposedly the stuffing goes right into
the teddy bear.
Then if we go all the way down there is
a little compartment here at the bottom.
I'll just flip open the door and you can
put any of your build a bear
accessories inside.
So we told you guys earlier that this set comes with two
build a bears that you stuff. You get a
brown one
and these are really really soft.
They're really nicely made and I can't
wait to stuff them. They're really cute.
And here's a pink one.
Oh my gosh these are about the size of a
beanie baby if you guys remember those.
These are no sew so when you stuff the
bears all you have to do is pull down
the zipper and the stuffing will stay
inside of the bear.
The kit also gives you two of these bags
of stuffing.
One for each of your bears.
They give you two t-shirts one for each of your bears.
Here's a really cute pink one. It has a
nice little star and heart design on the
front and then the other one- I saw this
and I just about melted.
This is a little kitty with glasses
shirt.
Oh my gosh isn't it cute? And the sleeves
of this shirt are just so cute.
They also give you these to plastic
heart-shaped lockets you just open up
them here on the side.
I can figure it out I think it's like
this.
There we go. You're going to put a wish
inside the locket and then put the locket
inside of your bear.
You also get two of these build-a-bear
workshop certificates.
One for each of your bears.
Some various punch out paper accessories for your bears.
Lastly some instructions and
how to use this build a bear workshop
stuffing station.
Are you guys ready to build a bear?
I sure am. The first step is to unscrew
the bear lid.
We're going to put in some of this
stuffing. An entire bag full.
Oh my gosh this stuffing is so soft.
This is some nice high quality stuff. No pun intended.
I'll carefully put all the stuffing inside of our machine.
Put the lid back on.
Now let's stuff the brown bear first.
Now i'm going to try to open up this
little bear in the back and then put the
little nozzle inside of the bear's back.
This sounds kind of weird.
This isn't going on very easily.
Let me try doing it this way.
Sorry you guys can't see ok finally I
got the bear on.
Now to get the stuffing
inside the bear we will just turn the
handle clockwise.
Oh it's working! Oh my gosh look at that!
Do you guys see the stuffing going into
the bear?
It's totally working!
As it pushes the stuffing into the bear i can feel the
tummy of the bear getting full.
Whoa ok now the instructions say I have
to push the stuffing into his arms and
legs first.
Now I just need to give him some more
stuffing so I'll put the bear back on the
nozzle.
My machine's not putting out any
more of the stuffing.
I might have to open up the lid and push
some of it down.
There this should work now.
(crash) Oops!
Oh man I just lost my bear!
All right let's try this again.
Hmm looks like the stuffing is having
trouble going into the bear.
I may have to push it down again.
All right there we go. That's working!
Oh alright i guess we got to push some
more now into his arms
and to his head. Since i don't have very
much of the stuffing left i'm just going
to fill him up manually.
You're going to want to use up the
entire bag to fill your bear.
Yay stuffing done! We'll set him aside
for just a moment.
I'm going to grab one
of these little heart-shaped cutouts.
On the back you're supposed to write down a wish.
Let me see let me think of a wish.
Hmm ok.
I wish... I wonder if this is supposed to
be like a birthday wish so you don't
tell anybody.
All right I'm going to write my wish
down and I'm not going
let you guys know what it is. I'll be right back.
Now that I have my wish I'm going to just fold the pieces in half,
grab the plastic locket and slip the
cardboard piece inside.
Make sure the locket is locked.
All right now this is going to go inside
of your build a bear just like this.
Now we'll just zip him up.
So that none of the stuffing or the locket comes out.
Oh look at this little guy. He's really cute!
I love how soft these are!
Oh I love him!
I'm definitely cutting off that tag in the back though.
Just in case you guys are curious
I also stuffed the pink bear.
I love these!
You can either keep both or you could
give one to a friend.
Let's see what the bear looks like with
the kitty cat shirt.
Oh look at this! Ok now that is super
cute and here's the other shirt.
I love these you know the Bears are so
much cuter with their clothing don't you
think?
Well you guys I thought this set was
completely adorable.
The only trouble I had was putting the
bears on the nozzle. you if you do have
If you do have
trouble with that you can always
manually stuff each one but it did take
me a couple of tries to get them hooked
onto the little machine.
Thank you guys so so much for watching
today I super appreciate it and as always
I will see you in the next video.
