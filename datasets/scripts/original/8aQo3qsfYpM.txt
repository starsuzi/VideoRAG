Hi, it’s me again; Executive Chef Fabrizio
Boterro introducing our new waffle makers
from Waring Commercial.
And look at this heavy-duty black cast construction.
We have a single version of 1200 Watts.
We have a double vertical one of 1400 Watts.
And now, we’re gonna make two waffles in
one single unit.
This vertical unit allows you to make two
waffles in one shot.
The way it works is, when you turn it on,
it will beep when it’s ready.
You pour the batter in, and it will beep when
it’s ready to eat.
So, beep when it’s ready to cook; Beep when
it’s ready to eat.
And now, we’re gonna make two waffles at
the same time.
Look at how much space you can save.
We’re gonna make one on top and one on the
bottom.
Very easy to operate this machine.
Here we go.
We have the batter on the top one; I’m going
to turn it.
Beautiful heating element – embedded.
And we have a feature that you can turn it,
and it does it perfect browning on both sides.
Put the other batter in, and the second it’s
ready, it will beep.
And now we’re turning it the opposite way.
Very easy controls, even heat.
And by the way, the embedded heating elements
and the rotary feature really gives it a great
baking and a beautiful browning.
You’re gonna see the minute these are done,
it will beep, I’m gonna open it up, and
show you exactly how beautiful these waffles
are.
You hear the beep?
It’s ready to eat.
And also the green light will come on.
So you turn it on, open it up; gorgeous waffle.
Absolutely flawless.
And now we have the bottom one.
Same thing – turn it.
Voila!
You couldn’t have done a better job with
less space, anywhere.
Some gorgeous raspberries, some beautiful
blueberries, a little powdered sugar.
And…Perfect!
The Waring Commercial Waffle Maker.
