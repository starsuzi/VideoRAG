assalamu alaikum
welcome to my cooking today i will be
showing you how to make a cream soda
that this was a request by a subscriber
and i'm sorry for the delay in the
upload now this is a popular New York
drink and even though the name is a
cream soda
it does not consist of neither egg nor
cream
it consists of three ingredients which
are for fat milk chocolate sauce and
soda water or carbonated water
[Applause]
and the quantity varies depending on the
size of the glass you were using I have
a four hundred milliliter tumbler here
in which I will be adding four
tablespoons milk full fat milk and three
tablespoons of chocolate sauce the
remaining of the glass will be filled
with a soda water add in the milk to the
glass next the soda water pour it in the
middle so it brings up the phone
now add in the chocolate sauce
now with the spoon stir the chocolate
sauce at the bottom
try not to stir the form too much as you
just want to mix the chocolate sauce in
the milk the reason you need to do is
slowly is so you do not change the color
of the form at the top the egg cream
soda is ready to be served
I hope you enjoyed the video do try it
out and let me know how you got on thank
you for your support
until next time goodbye and Allah Hafiz
