welcome back to my channels today's
video is gonna be a hamster diy
and there's gonna be three in total
and let's get started so the first diy
we're gonna be making these paper toilet
strips
and we're going to be putting them
together as a ball and inside
there's some treats
the supplies that you will need for this
diy
is scissors paper toilet roll your
hamster street
and this is optional um
paper toilet so
the first thing you're gonna cut up
the paper um
toilet tube and then you're gonna make
them into small
strips like these and make sure you keep
it at the same size
once you're done with that you're gonna
grab all your strips
and then you just want to put them
together and
i recommend starting with an x and you
just want to keep
putting them together
you might need um you might not need you
might not use all of them
but we'll see where we get here
all right once you're done with that
you're gonna
grab paper toilet this is optional
and then you're gonna put in treats
i got papaya treats and some sunflower
seeds
then you're just gonna put in the middle
of the paper toilet
and then once you're done you're gonna
roll it up in the paper toilet
and make it in a ball and then
you're gonna grab your stripped
paper toilet and then you're just gonna
put it in the gap
and you're going to close it and there
you have
your chew toy now if you don't want to
put
um paper toilet you could just put in
the treats
and you don't have to but my hamster
likes to chew a lot so i'll give it a
little challenge
and then there is the first
so the next diy you will need
popsicle sticks paper toilet
roll and that is it
my bad um you will also need a glue gun
or any type of glue
i don't recommend tape
so you will need three items for this so
the first thing
is you want to grab your glue gun and
then you just want to
glue it on this so you can put on your
popsicle sticks
then you're gonna grab popsicle sticks
and start putting
it on
if you are using a glue one i recommend
you doing it fast because you know how
the glue
gun the glue dries up very quick
and this diy we're going to be making a
seesaw
and since whoa
all right
i'm doing this kind of in a rush so it
might take some while
um there is a lot of plenty diys i find
on youtube
um and if you are looking for more you
can search that on youtube
once you're done with that i wanna make
it a little more secure
i'm gonna put glue on top of here
so i can put another popsicle stick
right across it so they can both stay
together
and then also on the other side
all right so when you're done with that
you already have your
seesaw and there it is
um i actually forgot a part
you want to put like popsicles in the
middle so
it can be like a kind of like a ladder
so your hamster can climb on
it could put its claws so it can climb
and then before you put in your hamsters
cage
um just let it rest for a while and let
the glue dry
i save for like about three minutes
and then you have your seesaw
all right and for this the last one
you are going to need
paper toilet
or paper
it doesn't really matter or an item
that you can work with and we're gonna
be making
a tube so a good size of a zoo where
your hamster can fit in
and you're gonna need uh you're gonna
need water
um britney can you go to my hamster's
cage and
there's gonna be um paper
like a tube there that's chewed up near
the wheel can you get it real quick
sorry about that so only three items uh
paper
um toilet um tube is in my hamster cage
it's near the wheel it's white it's
chewed up bring it all right
so you just need three items so what you
want to do
is grab paper toilet
and then you want to put it to the thing
and then you want to have water with you
i have a spray much easier
then you just want to wet it so it can
stay flat and it wouldn't
move and then you just want to keep
adding paper layers
and then you're just gonna fill it all
up with layers
and wet it all so it can stick and then
you just want to go like that
so i actually done one and then thank
you
it looks like this as you can see it is
so chewed up
my hamster loves these and
it's the same thing it actually fits in
i put a bunch of layers so it can be
strong you can actually see
the holes from
this so
once you're done with all of it you're
gonna wet it and once you're done with
all of it
you're gonna let it um cool down
i let it cool down for like a day and
then when i woke up
it was already dry i just slide it off
and then i just put it in my hamstrings
cage and
i put it yesterday in this hamster cage
and look how chewed up it was
so this is very easy all you need is
paper toilet
water and something that's shaped as a
tube
and then you're just gonna fill it up
and that is it
there was three easy diys
hamster shoes and toys and you can make
it in your home
most of this all supplies is all at your
home
