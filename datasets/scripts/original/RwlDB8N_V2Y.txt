hi my name is scott aaronson and i'm a
private chef
and i'm going to discuss how to use a
mandolin
now
this is my mandolin
comes with a stand which allows me free
of use i don't need to hold it with my
hand it'll it stands up on its own some
mandolins do not come with a stand in
which case you might need to get a towel
wet a towel like such
and
have it
keep your mandolin in place while you
slice this is about a
60 degree angle i would say it doesn't
need to be 60 degrees it can be 45
degrees but you want to have it on an
angle like this as you slice
okay
i don't need this towel so i'm going to
remove this
we have a potato here
now i have a guard some mandolins do not
come with a guard
i recommend a guard so if you purchase a
mandolin look for it to have a guard
it'll protect your hands in the end this
one comes with a guard with posts it's
great you just take your vegetable and
you place your vegetable right on the
post and it holds it in place see
just like that then what you're going to
do is you're going to take it you're
going to put it down on your metal
guard here and you're just going to go
ahead and slice through like that
and we're doing slices
as you can see very thin slices almost
paper thin
like a potato chip
homemade potato chips
if i want
potatoes or gratin i'm going to want a
thicker cut i'm going to go ahead and
dial this down
so it's thicker
and of course when i slice
you're going to get thick cuts
like this
see the difference
potato chips potatoes are groton
we also have blades that can be
interchangeable for matchstick cuts or
what we call julienne
i'm going to go ahead and enter this
into my mandolin
and
i'm going to go ahead and cut some
matchstick cuts
this is pretty thick we're going to go
ahead and dial this down remember you
dial down or dial up the thickness
of your cuts
and you just want to go ahead and slice
through
as such
as you can see
we have these julienne as they're called
or matchstick cuts
okay now these are pretty thin as you
can see
i can go thicker just dial it down
and we can go
to even a thicker maybe
uh
mini french fries
uh i can even go thicker than that just
by dialing it down even more it's your
choice
now you can cut all types of vegetables
with a mandolin
it's very versatile
and
it's
it's very handy
to cut all different types of vegetables
in all different shapes and sizes
and this is how you use a mandolin
