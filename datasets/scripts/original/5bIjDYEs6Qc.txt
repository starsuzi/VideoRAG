hi everyone it's helen here today i will
be cooking fire
for is the most famous vietnamese noodle
soup in the world everywhere has its own
secret
but today i will share with you my
homemade method of cooking for
[Music]
the final product will look something
like this let's get started
[Music]
firstly we will place the beef bones in
a pot filled with water and bring to
boil over high heat
after boiling for about 5 to 10 minutes
you will see the impurities right to the
top
then dump out the whole pot and rinse
the bones well under running water
this is a very important step to keep
the broth clear and it will save your
time skimming up the scum later don't
worry about losing the flavor because
during the first five to ten minutes you
may only get the badness of the bones
after that place the bone into a large
pot filled with five liters of water
make sure the pot is clean because you
don't want anything to contaminate the
broth
[Music]
then add a tablespoon of salt or
tablespoon of sugar and one peeled onion
the onion will help to keep the broth
clear and also add more flavor to the
pot
also add in the beef and bring to boil
then lower the heat to medium and cook
for about one to two hours do not cover
the pot and occasionally skim up the
scum and the fat
to create the amazing aroma of fur
you're gonna need
two pieces of ginger about the size of
your tongue
three star onions
two cinnamon sticks
two to three black caramel
and one onion
so easy to remember right bh04
you can use more spices but those are
the most basic to create for aroma
we're gonna cut the ginger into slices
and the onion into halves
next to bring out the aroma in these
elements we're gonna grill them
directly on the stove
if you're a westerner i hope you're not
freaking out when you see this
but yeah this is really what we
vietnamese do to bring out the flavor of
the spices we grill them open flame
until they are chopped
you can also grill them in the oven but
i just feel it more fragrant this way
now open the window and spread this
amazing pho aroma to the neighbors
sometimes i also use extra coriander
roots
so i'm gonna stack all the small items
into a large tea bag
these tea bags are very cheap and it's
disposable so very convenient
you can also wrap them in a cheek cloth
or
anything to make sure that it's not fall
out
then peel the onion and scrape out the
charred pot you can also use shallots
instead of onions make sure you clean
off all the black box otherwise kind of
make your broth turn dark and that is
not what you want and add all these to
the pot
it smells so amazing right now
what we aim for is a very clear broth
but amazingly fragrant and flavorful
[Music]
depending on the cut of the beef it
might take about one to two hours to
cook when it's cooked
soak the beef in a bowl of cold water
for about 10 minutes this is to prevent
the meat from
turning dark and drying up also remove
the onions because you don't want them
to break and make the broth less clear
then add seasoning powder salt sugar
fish sauce to your taste
then drain the beef and slice thinly
into bite-size pieces meanwhile we will
continue to cook the broth for a few
more hours
traditional foil can be cooked overnight
but if you don't have much time two to
three hours should be okay also slice
some fresh raw beef thinly if you like
for the garnishes we're gonna slice
onion into paper thin slices
then soak in a bowl of ice cold water to
reveal the strong smell and
make it more crunch
for the spring onion i'm gonna detach
the white and the green part and then
chop up the green part
fall in hanoi is only garnished with
onions and spring onions but in other
parts of vietnam like in the center or
in the south you will see a garnish
platter
which includes
asian thai basils and
salted herbs
and also bean sprouts which is blanched
in hot water for about 10 seconds
[Music]
so i blanch the bean sprouts and drink
and then wash the vegetables
and also the next step we're gonna do is
to cook the noodles
if you use dry noodle like i do
soak them in cold water to let them
soften a bit
then i blanch them in boiling water
you can do this for each bowl
or boil all the noodles at one time
after that wash it under cold water and
then hot water
that way the noodle will stay separated
and do not clump
to assemble the dish fill the bowl one
tablespoon of noodles and then place on
your beef slices
the onions
[Music]
and some black peppers
pour the hot sauce over and serve
to each fur sweeten a small lime wedge
add in spin sprout your favorite herbs
some hoisin sauce or sriracha if you
prefer
and then have a sip
i hope you like this recipe and thank
you for watching bye
[Music]
