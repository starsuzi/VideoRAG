hi it's Tomas again back in the Amaretti
Test
Kitchen and we're going to be doing
something special today and my favorite
theme is Southwestern so we're going to
do Southwestern Sunday brunch and the
first item we're going to do the sauces
for a chimy chunga a breakfast chimy
chunga with eggs and uh pork carnitas in
it let's get
[Music]
started first thing we're going to do is
we're going to preheat our
skillet and add 1 tblspoon of cooking
oil this is canola oil you can use light
olive oil you can use vegetable oil
whatever you normally use at home next
thing we're going to do once the oil
starts smoking is ADD chopped onion or
sorted bell pepper and
jalapeno you sauté your vegetables until
the onions are translucent but not
browned once your vegetables are
softened which takes about 3 to 5
minutes you add your chopped garlic
once you've added the garlic you just
sauté it until it's fragrant takes about
45 seconds once you can smell it it's
ready next step is to add your broth
this is vegetable broth you can also use
chicken broth if that's what you prefer
or if that's all you have next add your
chili powder your agave
nectar your cumin oil
extract
now stir this up until everything's
Blended well bring it up to a
simmer once you brought this to a simmer
you want to add your
Tomatoes stir them in real good add salt
and pepper to taste we're going to allow
this to simmer for about 10 minutes till
the sauce gets a little bit thicker and
then we'll be ready because this this is
a two-way sauce this is going to go
inside the Chim changa and then it's
going to also decorate the top of the
chimmy Chun adjust your seasonings if
required in this case we don't need to
adjust our seasonings it's perfect going
put it into this
bowl and let it come to room
[Music]
temperature now that we've completed our
salsa Picante the next step is to make
our hatched chili salsa the hatched
chili salsa will be used to uh decorate
the plate around the chimy changa so
let's get started first thing we're
going to do is add 2 tablespoons of
cooking oil to our sauté pan we're going
to bring that up to
temperature once you get your oil up to
temperature you want to add your chopped
onions and your hatched
chilies and sauté them until the onions
are
translucent which takes about 10
minutes once your pepper peers and your
onions are sauteed you want to take your
corn
starch and whisk it into the vegetable
broth till it's nice and smooth you
don't want any
lumps then we're going to add the
vegetable broth with the corn
starch to the onions and
peppers keep
stirring remember that in order for the
corn starch to thicken the sauce has to
reach the boiling point once your sauce
reaches the boiling point you reduce the
heat to a
simmer allow it to simmer for about 5
minutes and watch the thickening if it
gets too thick you'll have to add more
stock to it once you get this thickness
then you're going to add your
garlic
pepper
salt
cumin and
oregano want to whisk all that
in then you're going to allow your sauce
to simmer for about 30 minutes all right
we've been simmering our sauce for 30
minutes and we're going to check
thickness what you want to do is coat
the back of a spoon run your finger
through it and if the line stays out
that's good so we're going to take our
sauce if the sauce was too thick you'd
want to add a little bit more vegetable
broth to it to thin it out but this is
just fine now we're going to pour our
sauce into a serving bowl and we're
ready to decorate our
[Music]
plates hi this is the last sauce we're
going to make for our Chim chunga it's
called pimento Rojo first thing we do is
we take 6 oz of whipping cream whip the
heavy cream to soft peaks
once you've reached the soft Peak
stage fold in the sour cream this is 8
oz by weight the heavy cream was 6 oz by
volume combine
those add two teaspoons of
garlic okay the last item we're going to
add Mexican hot sauce you can start with
three or four tablespoons should know
what your friends and family can
tolerate
like I said you know what your friends
and family can tolerate so don't put too
much in or they won't eat it right now
I'm going to put this into a bowl but
eventually I'm going to put it into a
Piping Bag and that's it for the sauces
for our chimy
chungas now we've made three sauces here
for our chimy chungas we made a pante
sauce we made a hatched chili sauce and
we made a pimento Rojo sauce these will
be used while making our chimmy chongas
