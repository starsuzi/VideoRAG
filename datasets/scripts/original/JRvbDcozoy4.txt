family okay so we're going to do some
honey glazed carrots um my version
slightly different there's lots of ways
of doing it now I just want to show you
my carrots there you go what I've done
I've got them nice and Big And
Chunky I've kept the skin on I don't
need to take the skin I just give little
scrub and I've just parboiled them for
just a few
minutes in a little bit of salid water
so they're very
crunchy I've just cut one open so they
they're still really really crunchy
here so I don't want to cook them like
my mom
did she used to just boil a life out of
them until they
were a mush sorry M but it's a fact
right in here I've got a bit of olive
oil
uh you could just be doing this with
butter if you want and today I'm going
to be adding some
ginger so nice strips of Ginger fresh
ginger you could chop it a different way
if you wanted I just like the effect of
it that
way and to that I'm going to add a
little bit
of star on these just a few
pieces and I've got some lovely cinnamon
here sticks in that goes
[Music]
so I'm just going to infuse that olive
oil you could use a different oil if you
wanted maybe a sesame seed oil if you
want now we're going to drop in our
carrots now like I say these are really
quite
hard I like M with a bit of Bice on but
we're going to cook these for a while so
they'll get beautifully tender so I'm
going to throw these around in this
gingered flavored oil just for about 3
minutes stirr in all the
time I'm just going to add some black
pepper to
this I'm using a nice coar ground pepper
I prefer to use this in many things and
pl of as
well some
salt I'm using a sea salt but you can
use whatever you
like now I'm going to add a bit of juice
I mean what I've got here I'm using like
a little Tangerine or a mandarin or just
some orange juice a beautiful little s
flavor I love that in
there a few more
there and the Pips coming out the seeds
coming out I I really don't care about
that I mean some people would be
bothered about that not so bothered
myself and again now we got some liquid
in
there as you can see let's just cook
this again for a couple of minutes
giving it little stir every now and
then okay great so still got nice
firmness on my couch which is what I
like I mean you might not you might like
them like my mom used to make but for me
no
thanks now we're going to get some
honey so I've just got a regular jar of
honey
here I'm just going to pop some of that
in
and then run the heat through that honey
just for another couple of minutes
max and that will mix with
that orange or Mandarin
or
Clementine
juice and all of our lovely flavors so
yeah really quite simple just makes a
change from boiled
old carrots I mean try some different
spices in there Touch of chili could be
good maybe a bit of nutmeg I mean
endless really just take it in a
direction you
like so simple off goes the heat ready
to
serve not like my mom used to make I
prefer these hope that helps don't
