well let's do a before-and-after on this
rock I think it's going to be somewhat
fragile you can see the calcite teeth in
through here but I see some pyrites in
behind and throughout the rock not sure
what the base is but we'll we'll stick
it in me erotic acid and see what
happens okay so it's in the plastic
container and it's just covered with
water let's add the neurotic don't
breathe this stuff there we go
bubble bubble toil and trouble okay so
the waters turn green still working away
I can't see what the sample is doing
baby it's almost gone what do you think
oh and it's a patient well this is kind
of neat it's very fragile so some of the
stuff is not stuck on there very well
but look at that in that cool one of
those crystals up in there
big one down here lots of glitter and
then in the bottom of the container she
I don't know if I can show this all that
well see that I did lose some of the
black and some of the pyrite crystals
but all in all I think it turned out
alright thank you for watching
you
