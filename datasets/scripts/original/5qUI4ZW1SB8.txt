hi boys and girls uh this is Daniel bean
from Marvin today's lesson I'm going to
teach you how to use the whammy bar like
I do and uh I think most the stuff I
picked up was probably Jeff Beck that's
obviously in my mind the best guy at
this also Scott Henderson does it and uh
let's Dive Right to it uh there's not
that much to it but the technique is
kind of specific so if you're playing
with your fingers like Jeff Beck the
important thing to do is to make sure
that the whammy bar kind of rests in
this part between your thumb and your
index finger and you're going to use
your thumb and index finger to pick uh
and you it's just like not having it
there so just like you're using normal
finger picking technique uh usually just
two fingers and most of the playing is
done with the thumb but you're going to
have it right there so some of the more
basic things you can do is just you know
Bend notes but in Guitar when you're
bending you usually can just uh you know
push the string up the real advantage of
the wany bar is that you can really push
the notes down in pitch and you know
have a br that's actually making the
note flat so most of the time you're
diving but you're also going up some you
have to set up your guitar certain way
if you take a look at my bridge it's
really a little bit off the body
so you're setting up your G string to go
up somewhere in the range like a minor
third to a major third good like B flat
I think mine set up to B
flat or to B almost to B should be set
up better but uh so major
Third Kind of right in between there but
ideally I think B is the note you want
to set up your bridge to so when you
push it down all the way the G string
goes up to a b and the B string goes up
to a C sharp and the E string goes up to
an F that's like when it's set up just
right that's you know so basically this
E Minor triad e b or GB e goes up to a b
c Shar F to a
b okay so um if we look at like a minor
pentatonic as uh you know like let's say
we're playing a blues z a or something
some Wy bar things we can do that are
cool
um or you know just diving from one from
a note to the note a half step below in
the scale that's something I do quite a
bit so if you have a lick
like you know just like a pentatonic
thing I like to kind of
go so I do that by picking the notes
with my thumb and then bending the
whammy bar with my index f finger so
I'll play it
[Music]
slow so that'll be like playing
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
uh yeah so that's one lick uh another
thing that's really cool to do is um you
can get this almost har Monica sound if
you bend down from the fifth of the
scale which is
e It's Kind it's a microtonal thing so
it's it's really the note that's um a
quarter step sharp of D so you get
this I think that's a really cool SL
like slide type sound Derek Tru does it
all the time if if you take a slide and
you figure out where that is between the
notes you know I'm going to try to play
this in tune so here's uh
a that's
g
e here's that note do you hear
[Music]
that so it's not D it's a little bit
sharp of
d
so you're not quite getting all the way
to D or getting to that note and that's
that not is where it's at that's that
blue sound to me that's really Delta
kind
of it's more vocal so there's all these
microtones you can find around you know
around these scales
that that really sound nice there's
another one between the m major and
minor
[Music]
third so the idea is to be able to play
that kind of stuff with your whammy bar
so you you have to get that sound in
your ear
like so that's a nice thing another
thing that I like to do is play a note
bend it down a half step pull off with
my left hand and then release the bar so
I can get
this so I'm really playing G F sharp
dsharp E but it it sounds
like so G bend down with a
whammy pull off the e but it's actually
a d Shar and then let go so if I'm
playing like a lick and like
a
[Music]
so but you have to make sure that the
notes fit in the scale so like if you do
it starting on an e you bend down to an
E
flat then you pull off to a c but it's
actually a b cuz you're bent down and
then you let go it's a back to it's back
to a c
[Music]
so now uh in terms of vibr I I mostly
pull up
[Music]
like those
kind um and another thing that I you
like to do is uh this kind of technique
where you just pinch the whammy bar up
this gives you the nice rattle that just
back gets a lot which
[Applause]
is it's a nice vocal kind of like I
don't
know another thing is grabbing two notes
B bending one of
them and adding the whammy you get this
nice rattle
happening it's almost like a third note
like
[Music]
a yeah and also with the Jeff back
technique you work the volume a little
bit so you can swell
[Music]
into
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
