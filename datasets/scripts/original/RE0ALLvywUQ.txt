hello my name is Deb D wolf and today
I'm at Cool Tools and what we're going
to be doing next is a flower petal cane
that we will be using to make a flower
cane another thing you can do with your
Skinner blend which is really cool is
instead of making a jelly roll which you
can do either with or without another
sheet of clay you can just use the
Skinner blend the way it is and roll it
up like a jelly roll um without another
color but what we're going to do now is
make a plug that that's this color on
one end and the dark color on the other
end this
um was run through on the thickest
setting of the pasta machine and now I'm
stepping
down
two widths and I'm going to keep my
finger next to it again so that it
doesn't change in width this way um and
I'm going to run it through again and
it's going to lengthen some
more made it a little longer and now I'm
going to go down two more widths
again and send it through and this can
get a little tricky because it's long
and it's sticky it wants to stick to
itself and you have to be gentle with it
and coax it apart if it's sticking to
itself but now we have a really long
sheet and I could go down even further
than this if I wanted to but I think I'm
going to stop here because um I don't
want to tempt fate and have a mess that
I can't work with I'm going to cut off
the
end
straight and then I'm going to fold it
back on its
s about an inch and a
half and make a nice crease there get
out all the
air and this is going to be an accordion
fold I'm going to go back the other way
and fold it back on itself and get out
all the air and I'm just going to keep
doing this over and over until I run out
of the strip of clay
okay I have come to the end of the strip
of clay now and I've got a little extra
here what I'm going to do is turn it
over and just cut that off
straight now you can see the
layers and we're going to reduce it just
like this just a little bit to make sure
we have all of the
air
out we will be turning this into a round
cane though
eventually so you don't have to be
really concerned about the shape it's in
right
now and I'm rolling it lengthwise I
could be rolling
it across too if I wanted to widen
it
okay to turn this into a round cane what
we we do is put our fingers at the
corners and
pinch at this point I don't want to make
it much longer than it is right now so
if it's starting to length I'm just
going to push my fingers back
in
okay there you go and now I want to put
some veins in my
petals and what I
chose was one of my Skinner
Blends that went from Blue to Yellow I'm
going to use this for
the veining in my petal and I made this
the same way we made one of our other
Skinner Blends by rolling it up and
compressing it into a plug and
flattening it out and running it through
the pasta machine um until it was very
very thin you can see how thin this is
it's probably at
um like the fifth setting on my pasta
machine it might be different on yours
all pasta machines are just a little bit
different but I think you can see the
thin the thickness of of this and I'm
going to be slicing into my petal cane
and
inserting these into the slices I make
so I have to decide do I want the yellow
on the bottom or on the top when you're
looking at the side of my cane and I
think what I'm going to do is keep the
the blue side of this ribbon down at the
bottom and the yellow up at the
top this would also be easier to do what
I'm going to do next if you could let
your cane rest
overnight um
so keep that in mind if you're doing
this but what I'm going to do is make
Cuts in my
cane starting at the base of what I'm
assuming is my petal I'm assuming that
this is the outside of my petal and this
is the base or the center of the flower
the base of the petal and I'm going to
make a cut that doesn't go all the way
through it's going to be a cut that's
about as deep as this is
wide okay so very carefully I'm going to
cut into my
petal and kind of spread it apart with
my fingers because I'm going to want to
insert a piece of this
into this
cut I remember I wanted the yellow at
the top of the petal so that's how I'm
going to put it
in and close it
up I don't know if you can see that oh
here you can see it better on this
side so that's one vein in my petal so
far and now I'm going to make a couple
more to either side of this
cuts the same
way
and put put these inside the same way
again it's sticky so
it's hard for me to get them in there
takes a little bit of fussing but we'll
get
it there we
go I'm going to do one on the other side
and
whatever you have
left that's sticking out you can just
shave off because you're not going to
need
that so I'll get rid of that
now I think you can see the
veins
there and now I'm going to make it round
again because sometimes it loses
its roundness when you're doing
that and I'm going to reduce this
you can see the pattern of the veins in
there we are going to make this long
enough reduce it enough so that we have
at Le at least enough for five petals
around the center of our
flower and I like
to end up with about 15 or 16 inches
when I'm done at
least because that will give me if I cut
it into five petals that will give me a
3in
cane so after I cut off the scrap ends
of my cane I want to measure it to see
how many inches it is and we've got
12 14 16 cool so um we're going to make
a five petal flower and if we divide 16
by five let's say 15 by five we'll have
an inch left over we're going to cut 3
inch
pieces from this
cane
five and we'll save that for something
else
okay now you can see the green here on
one side of this petal cane and what I
want to do is is pinch it just a little
bit where that green is to kind of make
just a very
um not a real distinct teardrop shape
but just teardrop a little bit so it
looks a little bit more like a
petal and I want to do that to all five
pieces and
now this jelly whirl and striped cane
that we made before is going to be the
center of our flower so I want the same
length piece of that for the
center and I'm going to start
forming the petals around the
center keeping th that green stripe
that's the base of our petal touching
the center
of the flower
and just gently press it until it
adheres and just gently squeeze it all
the way around so you know everything is
sticking together
and there's our
flower if we had started with smaller
petal canes and a smaller center this is
another example of another flower cane
where the petal cane was a little bit
smaller and the center was a little bit
smaller so I wound up with a little bit
smaller here's another
example
now this cane is still
warm and if I sliced it the way it is I
mean we can do that and I'll show you
what
happens it's not too bad actually
even though it's still
warm but if you let it rest overnight or
even longer it will be much easier to
slice without
Distortion see I was slicing that
without looking so one end one side
ended up really really
thin but if you let them rest they will
they will slice up much neater and they
won't
squish from being too
soft but that's our
flower here's another example this one
has more
petals okay one of the ways you can use
your flower cane is by just cutting off
slices you can bake them just like this
and then drill a hole um on one end I
can even pierce it before baking to show
you put a jump ring in
there and you have an element for an
earring or a incorporated into other
beads in a necklace whatever you'd like
to do you can also cut off very thin
slices
and use
them on a
background to
create
pictures other types of canes and
arrange them on a background to make a
picture or a pretty design or whatever
you want you can lay a a template shape
over this and uh cut it out after you've
um put all of your design elements on it
