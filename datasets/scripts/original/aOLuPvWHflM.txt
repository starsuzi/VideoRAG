hey guys it's sarah and today i'm back
with another air dry clay tutorial
once again i'm using the brand crayola
and it's in the color white today i'll
be showing you how to make
um everyone's favorite summer treat a
popsicle
and i saw this pin on pinterest and all
credit goes to
the person named make life lovely
um it said like popsicle air dry clay
charm by make life lovely
so that's her original design um i
didn't look on the instructions i just
looked at the picture and it looked so
simple
i just figured by looking at the picture
i could probably just figure this out
so here it is so you'll need some food
dye
and right now i'm using the brand
um you'll need some air dry clay and
since i'm since i have uh
the white color i'll need to be using
the dye
and then you'll need some toothpicks
also you'll need a container
and a mixing um item
to color the dye taking
a very small amount of clay and dyeing
it whatever color you want after you've
dyed the clay
um make your clay look a shape like this
sort of like a dome shape and i don't
know if you can see that on camera
but you have to make a mark like that
so make two of those marks and then uh
next we want to make the stick so for
the stick all i did was took um
an undyed piece of glass um and
rolled it up into a ball then rolled it
up into this little
piece of thin clay and stuck it on so
just repeat this process you can do it
for you can make like any color of the
rainbow that you want
i'm gonna try to make all the colors and
see how that turns out um
so yeah just experiment and this is
definitely a super duper easy one one
of the easiest that i've ever done in my
life
so yeah and also just a tip don't forget
to make the marks
on the other side of the popsicle too
so i made these popsicles off camera and
i have some of them look really similar
on camera but they aren't
so i have this red one orange and yellow
and green one blue one
purple and pink one and the pink and the
red look so similar
but in real life they're actually not
similar at all
and um i'm really happy with how this
came out this is super simple and
anyone can do that so thank you guys for
watching please watch my other videos
bye
