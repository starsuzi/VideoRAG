hello i am stephanie minton and today i
am going to
show you how to give your chicken a bath
and get it ready for the show
supplies you will need are three tubs of
water some mild detergent
a soft bristle brush and a towel your
first step is going to place your bird
into the first tub of water the water is
rolling off her feathers that is because
chickens have natural oils in their
feathers just work the water
around the chicken to get her as wet as
you possibly can
once you have your bird wet you will add
some mild detergent
to the water then you just work
the soapy water around your bird
as you are washing the bird you want to
make sure that you are going in the
direction the feathers
naturally go so you do not harm the
feathers your next step
after you've gotten her clean in the
suds is to pick her up
gently and place her in the second tub
which is clean water
once you've placed her in the clean
water you will work your hands
again around her body removing all the
suds
from her feathers
the third step is to put her in the
third tub of water
and again rinse her off and make sure
you have
all of the detergent off of her feathers
once you have your bird nice and clean
you're going to pick her out
of the third tub and wrap her with a dry
towel
this will help speed the drying process
of your bird
today it is nice and sunny and warm
outside
if you are doing this in the winter time
i suggest doing this inside
where you can control the temperature
and you may possibly want to use
a hair dryer on a cool setting if it is
too hot you will hurt the bird
once you've gotten her cleaned and dried
off you can place her in a
clean surface so she has time to
naturally dry
remember to plan ahead and bathe your
chicken at least 48 hours before the
show
it takes at least 48 hours for the
natural oil to restore to the chicken's
feathers
now you have a clean chicken ready for
the show if you have questions regarding
bathing your chicken or you want more
