hey guys today in this video I will be
showing you how to do a fish tail effect
but instead of using your loom we're
going to be using one
fork here's an
example this is a hexa fish but in the
next video I will be showing you how to
do one with two
forks instead with a loom it's much
easier with a fork than a
loom okay so for this bracelet you're
going to need two colors or the colors
you choose if you don't have a mini hook
use a
toothpick a c
clip don't I recommend you don't use
your fat CL clip your fat sorry your fat
hook because it's much harder to hook
them and place them onto the fork okay
so let's get
started start placing your first band
onto your fork so what you want to do is
you want to hold it with your finger
like
this stretch and turn onto the fork
stretch and
turn and it should look like mini eights
two eights onto the fork like this but
with one
band okay now get your other
color put it onto your band hold it with
your finger stretch and turn stretch and
turn
turn pull it down and you should have
your two bands of eights
now get your mini
hook or your
toothpick
get pull and place it
up pull place it
up pull
[Music]
up it's a bit hard to get it
cuz by the time they get smaller so it's
kind of hard to get them in pull them up
so this is how it should look like so
far more or less get your Larter
[Music]
band make an eight again well two
eights okay your
hook pull up
[Music]
this is how it should look like so far
I'm going to explain it to you one more
time and then I'm going to fasten the
video okay get your dark blue band or
the color you have that you prefer pull
well
stretch and turn stretch and
turn and make it into an
eight then get your mini
hook at um the ending bands right here
hook them hook one of the part and Pull
and put it over the fork
pull and put it over the
[Music]
fork okay and this is how it should look
like do that repeatedly and you will
have your bracel it in about an hour
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
pull down
and it and place over your
[Music]
fork and this is how it should look like
so
far and this is how it should look over
here in the fork on the fork
okay when you're done with your
size and you're happy with your bracelet
size and fits your
wrist then you get either your mini hook
or your toothpick I rather to I rather
use a toothpick because it's much easier
to get get it off
so put these off get these off of your
fork like this one at a
[Music]
time and it's like this is perfect it
should look like
this on your toothpick it should have
four okay then get your
band and Pull and put this over then
after you've hooked it in
with your toothpick this is how it
should look like a see then you would
get and you would hook it off
here and place it onto your finger and
get your c s
clip okay stretch it out like
this put in your S
Clip then on this side you don't have to
put an extra band because as you can see
you you have here bands you just stretch
one and stretch the
second and put it like this on your
[Music]
fingers and hook it in on to his
[Music]
clip and there you have your fish tail
effect and here you have your fish tail
it was very easy all you had is a fork
which you have at home
your mini hook which you can get it it's
in the link description down
below if you don't want to use a fork
anymore and make it easier all you have
to do is get your loom kit which is in
the link description down below as well
and in the loom kit there is your loom
your big fish hook uh your big
hook your s or C clip
also get your tie dye and
your uh half tie dye
bands your neon bands and your normal
bands
