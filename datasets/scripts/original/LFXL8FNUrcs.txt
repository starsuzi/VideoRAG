- Hey, everyone, Jerry James Stone here
and today's recipe is
well, it's a baked oatmeal.
It's a blueberry and walnut baked oatmeal
and I love oatmeal, it's
one of my favorite things
but if you kinda have an issue
with the texture of oatmeal
'cause it's not the most appealing,
this is a really great way
to get a lot of that yummy,
healthy oatmeal into your body
in a delicious new structure and format.
It's baked.
It's like a little polenta cake almost.
I think you're really gonna love this.
Let's get to it.
Okay, so to start making this recipe,
we're gonna begin with some rolled oats,
we're gonna add in some baking powder,
some ground cinnamon,
salt, some brown sugar
and I'm just gonna mix
that together a little bit
before I add in the wet ingredients.
Break down that sugar.
Okay, I'm gonna add in some Half N Half,
the beaten eggs and some vanilla extract.
Let's go ahead and mix that all together.
Now, we're gonna fold in
our frozen blueberries
and some chopped walnuts and
just fold this all together.
Add the mixture to a 9" x 9" pan.
Get it spread out evenly.
Let's give it a good shake
and now we're gonna bake it at 350 degrees
for about 40 minutes.
After you remove it from the
oven, when it's done baking,
just let it cool for a
little bit and then dig in.
How great does that look?
There you go, that's your
next breakfast, right?
Okay, let me know what you think of it.
