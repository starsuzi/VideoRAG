hey guys so today i'm going to be making
sugar water and you guys might be
wondering
why do you need sugar water natasha well
that's because um sugar water is
is um like let's say that you made a
jelly and you
and it's like all refrigerant
refrigerated and stuff
so um it's the time to eat it um and
you eat it any taste is not sweet at all
and you need something
to perk it up that's the thing that's my
case right now um so i'm going to show
you guys
how to use it
so there are only a few ingredients that
you need
one is just a small little cup like that
to store your water in
and then next is some toilet rolls
not toilet rolls kitchen rolls that's
right
i like to take two pieces and then just
wrap it into one
and then just put it on the area where
i'm gonna make my stuff
and then you're gonna need hot water and
sugar
so now since my hot water is blowing up
i can just get ready
so i'll need a small spoon
and just put the spoon into your cup
and then now we're just going to take
whatever sugar they're using i'm using
this brand which
i don't know what brand this is but
whatever brand it is
um i like to use white sugar
so now i just like to take two to three
teaspoons
of it or dessert spoons
or everything just teaspoons i don't
know so right now i'm gonna be using
three spoons
three and a half okay
so now your cup is meant to look really
sugary and
nice so i'm just gonna get
my hot water
and we're just gonna put that in about
half the cup
okay that's half the cup you just want
to leave it here
and we're just going to mix this two
substances together
okay so now
it looks clear so that's a good sign
i'm gonna be adding one more teaspoon
my teaspoon a teaspoon
of sugar
i'm just gonna mix it in
just a little bit more water
that it like is clear so no greens are
left inside
now i should smell
i don't know water like and
what is that
what is that seriously come here
come here oh my god
what the hell
slowly hey
who asked you to move
sorry i'm stuck here
trying to catch this black thing
i don't know what it is but it's not an
insect
let's just go in with the flow
anyways okay i took it out
okay so this should be a concoction all
done
and that's a sweet water i hope you
liked it
