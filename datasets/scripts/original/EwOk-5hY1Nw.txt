hello this is joina with modern
Homemakers and in case you were
wondering if we were ever going to get
around to finishing this couch project
today is the day so if you missed part
one of how to reupholster a couch I
showed you how to do the cushion which
was all I needed at the time um and this
is not a professional repulser class
people this is how to do it at home
without any special tools so it looks
good enough to get her done if you don't
have the money to go buy a new couch and
um what we're going to do today is my
next problem which I I even temporarily
fix with duct tape isn't that pathetic
but my children have torn a hole in the
side so we are going to embrace it
people we're going to pull it off so
it's smooth and we are going to
do the arm treat this like a big puzzle
every couch is different um we are not
going to be using actual professional
upholstery tools nail guns tack strips
all that crazy stuff we don't have them
and if I had to go buy all that stuff
I'm not going to save any money so I I
would I would just go buy another cheap
sofa so what we're going to do starting
with this arm is um we're going to
pretend that this is its own little
piece and we're going to start with it
so some fabric here now depending on
your fabric um really really impressive
re upholsterer people uh upholsterers
they they can go in and match your
Fabrics match your patterns like this
polka dot would touch this cushion in
the exact same way you're not going to
find that here we're uh this is a
beginning sewing giving you the strength
to go try something on your own
so I just need enough in front to be
able to gather that
Okay so we've got enough on the side to
tuck we've got enough in the front to be
able to gather
that our side we have more than enough
but we're not going to bother cutting
that right
now in our
back we just need enough to be able to
tuck in so I need
that so what we're going to do cuz
cutting a pulser fabric is scary cuz
it's so expensive we're going to use our
pens and I'm going to pull back here
where I tucked in that fabric and I'm
going to pull up right where my tuck was
and go a little bit to the side of it
and that is our cut line we're going to
go all the way across no fancy Cuts just
getting us our smaller rectangle cuz as
you can see I got a lot of this fat
fabric what you want to do but you don't
know how much you're going to
need and if you take months to finish
your project like I did it may not be
there when you go back I was so grateful
that they still had my fabric anyway so
not doing an exact science at all here
I'm going to use my dots as a
guide and I'm about midpoint
through that series of
dots and we're going to go all the way
up
and
across might be a little wasteful in
some patches but we're going to save all
our scrap and probably make some more
pillows and we might even do my
Ottomans which the children have also
destroyed taking out that
pen now that we've got got a little bit
of cut going on we're going to tuck that
in for
now and we're going to tuck that
in now we're going to be stitching
things because we're not going to be
using any sort of nail gun or
anything so we're going to stitch to the
existing couch material that's on
already on there now professionals are
going to strip off everything that's on
here they're going to repat it all that
stuff this is in good condition so we
don't need to do that so we're just
going to be it's almost like making a
slip cover that doesn't move that's kind
of what we're doing so got that tucked
in
there and then we're going to come
around
front now this layer is going to be
covered up by what we do next so you can
see this is not an exact science I'm
going to play with this and I'm going to
get it to where I think it looks pretty
you can see this is what it was before
I'm changing the shape a little bit to
make this easier on myself
it's my couch I can make it what it
needs to
be so I'm going to look at the side here
I'm going to shove some pins over here
so I don't mess up the
side oh sorry I st what I'm doing from
the side here so before I I gather this
I'm going to put a couple pins over here
so the fabric doesn't
move so
putting in a couple pens might even
stick one down at the
bottom and that's just to hold my spot
so everything doesn't move around to
really attach this to the bottom once
again I'm going to have to take off
those chair legs
so I didn't want to be lower to the
ground to start with though okay so you
can see I put a couple pins so things
aren't moving around and now we're
coming back around to the front
so this extra material whatever we don't
get cut away is going to be covered up
by our front piece that we do near the
end so since I'm changing my shape a
little and keep in mind this is all
going to be covered by a cushion as well
we're just going to start the
process
of
folding see I'm holding this with my
left
hand okay we're smooth with our right
I'm going to come look at all of this
again kind of pulling that over to
tighten it a little so you can see this
is a very just kind of fidget with it
kind of like wrapping a weird shaped
present that now once you get it to the
point where you're happy with it where
you'd be happy to sit there and stare at
that cut over to that armrest for a
second so you can see the
original so you can see that has grooves
and Contours in it as well it's not like
a seamless thing so come over
here so don't expect it to have that
smooth like a cushion it's going to have
folds and stuff in it and what we're
going to do at this point is start
pulling down from the top a little now
that we've got it from the sides and I'm
continuously taking my hand and
smoothing everything all the way
down and we're going to put some pens in
here so we don't lose our
spot it's almost like four layers of
pens here because we've got so many
things going
on
okay
those got to keep pulling this over it
keeps Loos over
there and then I'm going to throw in
some individual pins on each fold cuz
what I'm going to be doing is going in
and I'm going to hand Stitch these so
they stay in that shape
look
my angle quite
right yep so what we're going to do now
that we've got these where we're happy
with them is get rid of some of this
excess fabric because it's going to make
it hard to have it lay down
smooth so this coming from the side this
big piece is going to
cover everything that we just did like
this that piece is going to stay there
but you can see this is really bulky so
what we're going to
do is I'll put some pins here so we know
our
exact side shape
and I'm going to peel this open for a
second and
anything that is below this
point is kind of an extra bulk so I'm
going to go
in and I'm just going to take some of
that
off so it lays down
smoother let's go see I'm sure we've got
even more we can take off soon
yeah that's a lot less bulk in there and
we've got a little bit more I can take
off right in
here just be careful and double check
before you start cutting you know this
fabric is super expensive upholstery
fabric in general
okay it's starting to lay a lot flatter
in there so we're getting that pushed
down got some in here I can take off see
how that's got that extra Bend there so
I'm going to take a moment since this is
actually coming from the side and I'm
going to snip that
a little bit further
there we go it's starting to lay better
so just I'm taking my hands and I'm
dragging it
over to make sure nothing's bumping
out that's bothering
me so this whole piece here is
unnecessary so I'm going to get rid of
it
that's all of this is adding layers to
it
so
there I'm getting to the point where I'm
actually not going to put a pen in there
