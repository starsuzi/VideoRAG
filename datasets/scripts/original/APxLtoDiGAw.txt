hi welcome to Amber's Garden corner I'm
Amber and today we're going to propagate
some Rosemary and a little garden tip
[Music]
okay today we're going to propagate some
Rosemary and also I'm going to trim this
down also to reduce the height and to
help Bush it
out
so see if I can do this
onehanded so I'm going to come down in
here just before another
modood there
there we
go let's get this one
too there we go
and now that's pring
down
and I will use this for propagation and
dry this up for so one of the tips for
today is well as you can
see the Slugs and snails killed my poor
squash
plant so I've got a terracotta um tray
down and have placed cornmeal in
here and as you can
see there's one of the Slugs
now now that will eat the cornmeal and
die we'll check how this
works okay we're going to do a
propagation and a couple
methods um first off let's get a
couple oh another tip for the
day these shears here are strictly used
for
food items in the
garden um I don't cut anything else that
is a non-edible plant or possibly
dangerous um these are used they're
after they're used they're alcohol and
put away so take care of your your
pruners they're very important to you in
the
garden okay
so what we're looking
for and
that looks good if you see this this is
New
Growth I'm going to do it right
there
so go ahead and do
your your uh see if I can do this on the
camera slanted
cut
then pull these off here
and then I just use the edge of my
pruners
but slightly abaid the surface so that
you open up the cambian
layer not
overly aggressive just enough to scuff
it up these are where the roots will be
coming have your pot
of
soil
and insert into the
ground make sure it's nice and
cozy and that's method
one um and water
that and you want to make sure you keep
this moist I'll will usually put it on a
uh Northern side of
the house so that you get partly Sun but
not a whole lot really what you want it
to do is to focus on the root growth
right now
so let it stay
there and
then we will do a
similar let's snip off
a couple more
go through the same
process you pull off the
first so that you have a nice little
stick area
go ahead
and give yourself a nice
45 Scruff them
up and then we will put these in water
actually I will be putting one in water
and one in my fish tank I have a filter
on it and I'll put it on the back of the
fish tank so that it'll be in the
circulating
water
and you can also do this same method and
then stick it right in the ground um
what you do want is if you can
[Applause]
see this is more of a Woody kind of a a
stem you want to kind of stay away from
that you want where the new
growth it's all oozing with goodness and
will uh help brood up
faster
