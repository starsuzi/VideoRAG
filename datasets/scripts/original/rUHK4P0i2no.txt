I'll drop my video mmmm okay
I'm going to make bowties great amount
kind of bow ties everyone
I'm going to be using different colors
to make different bow ties husband
red or muddled going to be tender stage
I do not use needle and thread I'm going
to measure the square up first I'm going
to measure it about eight inches by six
features with my crazy cutout fabric
here
because nothing I measures over perfect
that's for sure
does not be perfect oh that's a cool
thing
I couldn't follow a pattern to save my
life so this
pay attention
so pretty sad down
we blew bad
right
don't y'all crazy the glue gun either
got a big lump and you're both I
understand
talking to you
like so
and then put aside up and we seam side
down
to the side I always forget to cut up my
little
little piece just has to be about
about two inches you are about who are
just well a 2x4
I just over
I make it too wide though if you do look
all comfy little yeah you don't want to
make it too right you drive
interactive robot Koston
and then take those keys and just like
this thing hold onto these edges
together and as you can see it's
starting to make a bow tie shape and to
this truck here
daughter
ha
together the first one I'm going to show
you how to make will go right onto a
dog's collar which would be awesome and
perfect world every actually call it on
their dog so I cut a piece about I don't
know going to be on the big dog just
return a big color but not too much
stretch there too much slack is all rise
it doesn't want to do what a loss it
should do a stretch and slide all over
the place
simple
to this
switched my backup
both sides even
over
cut off some exes
and choose to straight in French
there's a lot of those foot round that I
did in beginning that never see the
light of day because I didn't bother to
check in a triple shadowcery
going to make
and if your son
don't blame yourself here I've got like
industrial hands by now
hot glue third-degree burns
I'm sure together
let me give that a mint - cool
start pouring out already and pull
fingers caddywhompus and then your
real mouth
that's the side for a minute it the
way I'll show you how much I try the
same exact way we just did there it step
4 so he's going to loop in the back
you cut a longer piece of elastic and
stiff you lost it right underneath the
middle fold and then this little piece
can go around the ball tonight or last
way which is the complicated way it
looks kind of cool though allows to do
full collar and bowtie together so call
Brooke
the keys with the rectangular originally
cut out really only have to be a big or
small as you want to be
why not both hi obviously
and called out so or do anything but
just eyeball it and cut these up now
you're going to want to strip for the
middle piece just like one and the last
piece you're going to want this pipe
night one measure might get not have
done 500 times is how big around your
dog's neck is because I've done this
quite a few times I know I cut out a
piece it's about foot long and we've
enough for small five dogs a little
while the up just keep in mind
good
the cat color colors here
new cap collars with your competition
right
okay same thing down
I think you saw her first
oops
oops
this
Oh
in fact
make sure the luckiest time Street
you know we use a we gonna try this on
what proud of what we've got out towards
okay
this
on top
learn about me
colonies and future forces
that's what I'm sorry
this heist with real parts now let us
embark stretch one piece this way and
we're going to this little tab on this
edge yeah don't know where this one now
only this myself
they're already centerpiece because that
way it slides back and forth just a
constant
you have access to
at pieces forever
third-degree burns
now Google edges hold these for a little
bit there's a nice
you know
No
I use these little velcro round pieces
kazar
they're supposed to be like you just
brush up if she said blah blah
kind of or not so blue
otherwise your dog will have this
about two point two seconds
this mess
and wait for the who to drive there's an
e hanging out before you go snap it
together Aryans to pull thing together
now make mom trust me
and we like that
wrong wants us together stick your
fingers in here and talk about this
you can get really creative with the
bowties you can do for girls I've done
like double layered fabric so there's
kind of a ruffle hang on oh it's more
girly we can put stuff in the middle too
but
this was our first one
buff it out
definitely
caller two
