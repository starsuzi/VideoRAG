all right i'm going to
show you how i'm tying these garlic
knots
and got my bread rolled into
some several inch long ropes here these
are probably
oh six to eight inches long and i'm
brushing on
some garlic butter which is just some
melted butter
some garlic salt added i'm gonna take it
and take my robe here i'm just gonna tie
a simple
regular knot cross it
and fold one under and through so it's
just a simple
knot like that and pull it tight then
i'm going to take
these ends here now fold them over to
the opposite side
and tuck them in and fold this one to
this side
and just tuck it in and there
you have a garlic knot and what i'll do
is i will brush
even more of the garlic butter on top
once they're all done and i'll bake them
