good day guys welcome to Aussie Grilla
today I'm making a beautiful tasty
butterfly chicken so sit back and
[Music]
enjoy all right so for starters I'm
going to make a tasty basic chicken rub
so here I've got 1 and 1/2 tbsp of salt
and a tablesp of sugar
next I've got 1 teaspoon of ground black
pepper and 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne
pepper now of course you can adjust the
cayenne pepper to your taste this will
give a medium spicy chicken a tablespoon
of paprika and 1 tbsp of dried thme you
can use fresh herbs if you like and
lastly half a teaspoon of ground ginger
and 1 teaspoon of Chinese five
spice mix together well and this works
great on any roast chicken and is enough
for two birds so next of course you will
need a
chook and I'm going to do a basic
butterfly here so I'm going to turn over
that chicken and just cut down either
side of the backbone with some
[Music]
scissors so once the spine's out just
open it up and you can remove the rib
bones here I don't mind them there so
I'm leaving them I'm just keeping this
really quick and simple you can also
remove the breast bone if you like I'm
not going to worry about it though I am
going to remove some of the excess skin
though and then just cut a little slit
through this gristle just here and this
will help us to flatten it out so just
turn over that bird and press down on it
it won't take much force so quick and
simple and you have a butterfly
chicken so next I'm going to cover the
underside of it with some of that rub
then flip it over I'm using a little bit
of olive oil on the skin side only here
so rub that
in and then coat the top side with the
rub as
well so now I've got the barbecue set up
for indirect cooking I'm aiming for 220°
c for this cook and here I've got a
small chunk of mosquite now this is
optional but it will will really add
some flavor to your chicken so I've just
dropped it onto the hot
coals and now I'm just placing the
chicken on opposite the
coals lid down now this is going to take
1 and 1/2 to 2 hours to cook depending
on the size of your
bird and what you want to do when you've
got about 45 minutes left just turn that
chicken around
180° and add some vegetables if you
like
and 45 minutes later it is done look at
that guys absolutely beautiful
