Hi guys, Kirk here with Kirk Giordano plastering, we 
started this project a couple weeks ago in order  
to waterproof before the rains, the rains are here, 
they've just completed this belly band yesterday  
so, what I'm gonna do today, is I'm gonna show you 
how we waterproof these belly bands, and when I  
say, belly bands, here's the existing stucco band so a 
a fellow here matched this piece of wood here, and  
I'm gonna show you how we watertight this guy 
here, because it is raining and it's drizzling  
right now it's probably gonna come down on this 
but we have time enough to do what we want to  
do walk, around here Jay no I've got it started 
already here's the belly band and they use a  
pressure treated piece of wood anyway, what I'm 
doing is I'm covering this piece of wood putting  
on a second piece here is it you can do this 
belly band a lotta ways for a homeowner I would  
recommend you use a grace product it's a peel and 
stick you put it on the wood above it and it acts  
like a Zee flashing above it where beyond the wood 
and then come down and pass the band and then tuck  
it, in the reason I I'm putting the second sheet is 
right here is because I know from experience that
these are key to leaking, well I'm gonna get the 
corner aid which has a corner on one side then  
it's called a short flange, and when I pull all 
of it down like so get in here okay now when  
we're watertight, these tend to leak right here 
that's why I usually recommend a grace membrane  
but I know what I'm doing here when I use a short 
flange, it's gonna be completely sealed like this  
right here with no sharp edges, to poke this, 
anyhow that's what we're doing today, and what  
I also want to do today is because this paper 
has been here several a couple weeks now I want  
to wire it I want to put the wire on it, because 
now granted, we're in Alameda we're in the low  
spot in some areas the wind is so strong in a 
vibrate to paper, and it'll pull these little  
hammer tack staples loose, creating leaks, so we're 
gonna do today is just go ahead and finish wiring  
it, I'm gonna show you one more thing while we're 
waiting, all right guys same job there's also what  
we're now these arched windows and there's 
four of them they're all on the other side  
they have a bevel up here it's kind of like a 
water table that water table needs a flashing  
network where I guess they take a soldering iron 
and solder it so it'll come over this bevel and  
that's what's making it tough to find a fella 
to do this, we already had a guy, and turns out  
he's months out, so the homeowners looking for a 
good flashing guy if any of you guys are watching  
this you're working in the Bay Area this we're 
in Alameda today, can you call this evening he  
needs a guy who needs one quick and he needs 
somebody competent enough to do these radius  
bevels just starting to rain look at that 
pole right there you can see water coming  
down, but I don't usually like to come out and 
waterproof or weatherproof a job and then have  
to come back and wait on folks but sometimes we 
don't have that being in place so again you got  
any new flashing guys are looking for work 
better pretty sought after, this difficult stuff give me  
a call I'll pass your name on to the homeowner my 
name is Kirk Kirk giordano plastering, is 11-11-11  
right now so flashers call me, thank you for 
watching we'll see you guys on the next one.
