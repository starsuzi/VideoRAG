hey everyone it is me Dre y25 and today
I'm here with a quick little thing that
you know I like to do okay so basically
I love Black Eyed
Peas naturally if you want to do it the
real good back in the day Grandma way it
could take a while and you know you got
to do neck bones and ham HW and all that
and I don't have time for that I mean I
do but I don't cuz I'm hungry you know
so the way we're going to do my black ey
pece today is pretty much just the easy
way and I'm assuming most people do it
this way but a lot of people probably
don't even know that can um it's just to
use the canned black eye piece um you'll
need some bacon and some chopped onion
and then of course you can use whatever
rice you want I don't have any unab bin
today so I have to use some boil in the
bag success
rice so I'm just going to go over to the
stove and show you how to so basically
all we're going to do is saut√© out bacon
and our bacon and onions together um you
don't really need to put any oil in the
pan I've already preheated My
Pan bacon and onions together is really
good and we're just going to you want to
use a La
[Music]
pan turn my heat down a little
bit come in
close okay and you just want that to
sizzle around
together now what I like to do
is I like to season it with a little
garlic
powder if you have onion powder you can
do that too try not to let the garlic
get on the actual
pan
okay do a little bit of
salt not a lot I hate the salt cuz it
keeps falling out the
[Music]
bottom you don't need a lot excuse me I
throw the rest of my salt in the
sink and a little
[Music]
pepper and we're going to just let this
simmer
together and get all
tender and when it is done I'll be right
back show you so our onions have
tenderized look down here our onions are
tenderized our bacon is actually cooked
but because it's with the onions it's
not going to cook crispy like normal
bacon like if you were like making bacon
and eggs but it's cooked so at this
point you're going to dump your black ey
peas in and I drain them a little bit
but you want to leave a little bit of
that Black Eye Peas sauce Black Eye Peas
sauce yeah and because you know you want
to kind of form a little I don't know
sauce you know because this is going to
go over your
[Music]
rice and you're going to let this and
the bacon and the onions kind of simmer
together and season it to your liking
the basic seasonings I always use that
give it a really good flavor of course
the garlic powder onion powder if you
have it
um you could do seasoned salt a little
bit but I prefer regular salt seasoned
salt has a a certain flavor beyond the
salt part so I don't know but what
you're going to do is you're going to
kind of let this all come
together and it's going to thicken
up so I'm going to EAS them mine a
little bit
[Music]
more
um momm don't talk well I want to tr
with me up
there I'm tired I'm tired I'm sorry my
kid he thinks that I'm playing with him
apparently and he's not really listening
to what I'm
saying I am this box is saw is broke on
the bottom so I don't even open it
anymore I just shake it from the
bottom since every time I go to pour
some in my hand it seems to come out
from the
bottom and we're pretty much just going
to put this I'm going to put it on about
I don't know
four excuse me I'm going to just letting
it thicken
up now I'm going to show you something
else I didn't do a video for this
because I didn't feel like it at the
time I figured this was
quicker but what I did was I made some
sweet and sour ribs let's take a quick
look at these oo
hot get
close how does those look that's in the
oven baked at 320 for about 3 hours they
are tender cuz I tried a piece that's
how I know yeah but pretty much um I
mean if you want to do it homemade you
could and I can actually do a video for
homemade sweet and sour sauce if you
look on my um sweet and sour pork you'll
see I made homemade sweet and sour sauce
but if you don't want to do that you can
use the little Choice sweet and sour
sauce and you just pour it on the last
15 minutes the cooking and use one of
these brushes so you know get it all
around and then you put it back in the
oven for about another 10 minutes and
let it cook and come together so that's
that so the next time you see me I will
be plating my hey guys I'm back take a
look doesn't that look good I have my
sweet sour ribs some uh french green
beans which I just season with garlic
powder pepper butter salt and of course
my quick and easy Black Eye Peas and
rice so hopefully you'll
like I know I
do take care no recipe needed very
simple watch the video bye
