You want to choose a fish that has a
really great meaty texture like this
Australia Barramundi that were using today, that's nice and thick.
Make sure we pat it really, really dry
and this is important anytime you're
cooking fish, but it's especially
important with the grill because it's
going to help prevent this from sticking.
Then we're going to brush it with
some oil—just make sure you coat
every last inch on each side.
So next up, we'll season it with some salt
and pepper,
and again, we want to make sure we season both sides so that they both taste good!
And then let's talk about the grill. So
I'm doing this on an indoor grill today
but pretty much follow the same
instructions when you're grilling
outdoors.
Next, it's really important to oil it! So I 
have paper towel here and I'm just going
to dab in this oil and brush it down,
carefully take each piece of fish and
just lay it down and that sizzle is
exactly what you want to hear.
You want to cook the fish over
medium-high heat, but resist the urge to
poke and prod—you want to let it just do its thing.
Keep a close eye on it...when it starts to
turn opaque around the edges, and you can
kind of see it starting to brown, then you know that it's just about ready to flip.
So this one is coming off perfectly...
and be very careful...ah, look at those grill marks.
Perfect! So once the fish has been
carefully turned over it really just
need another minute or so to finish
cooking. And put it on a plate, we have
some grilled vegetables.
Here i just made a fresh herb sauce—it's
sort of similar to a chimichurri with
lots of raw garlic, parsley, and different
herbs.
Mmm... amazing!
