You can transform the look of your
home with a fresh coat of paint.
But before you get started, there's
a few things you should know.
First, pick up samples of
paint to test on the surface
before you purchase large quantities.
Lighting and location can slightly alter
the way paint colors look on a surface
than they appear on the paint swatches.
You want to be confident
about your decision
before you make the investment.
The paint finish or
sheen you choose also
impacts the way paint colors show up.
Sheen refers to how much
light the paint reflects.
The more reflective the paint,
the shinier it will look.
Generally speaking, flat
paint hides imperfections
but can be hard to keep clean
unlike matte sheens that
have a low-luster reflective
finish but is easy to clean.
Customers usually find that eggshell and
satin sheens are a good middle ground
option and perfect for
most interior paint jobs.
Semi-gloss paint has a
sleek, radiant appearance
that's good for cabinets and trims.
And high-gloss paints are
most resistant to stains
considered too shiny for walls
but perfect for trim and doors.
Once you have made a selection
and started your project,
blend paint from different
gallons as you work.
Even though paint is mixed by a
computer and extremely accurate,
slight variations can sometimes
occur from can to can.
Consider mixing paint into a large
container like a five gallon bucket
to ensure a consistent color mix.
Measure your walls to ensure you
have enough paint to cover them.
Calculate the total square footage,
including the alcoves and dormers.
You'll also need extra
paint for multiple coats
and potential touch-up
jobs down the road.
Even if you discard the leftover
paint, always keep the lid
or record the paint formulation so
you can match the color in the future.
Consider all the paint supplies you'll
need to help you perfect the job.
Start with basics like
paint trays, a ladder,
paint brushes four corners, and
paint rollers to cover large areas.
But also consider
picking up an extension
pole, which attaches to the rollers
so you can get to those hard to reach
areas.
To help create sharp lines, you'll
need painter's tape and a paint brush.
Follow the guidelines of your
manufacturer when using paint supplies,
and take all necessary
safety precautions.
Also, open windows and doors to ensure
good ventilation when working inside.
Move furniture and other personal
belongings out of the workspace.
Completely cover and protect
light fixtures and ceiling fans.
Remove outlet covers and
hardware if necessary.
Use drop cloths to protect indoor
flooring, outdoor furniture,
countertops, and appliances.
Cover the ground, patios and
decks, bushes, and other vegetation
outdoors as well.
Complete all repairs
before you start painting.
Paint is less likely to stick
to rough and dirty surfaces.
Patch up holes, wash and rinse
greasy spots, scrape and sand cracked
or flaky areas.
Also, replace rotten wood or apply
wood harder to the affected area
if the damage is minimal.
Prime your walls if you're
looking to change the paint color
or sheen considerably.
Primer not only covers
up colors and stains,
but it allows the top coat to
stick to the surface better.
An all-in-one primer and
paint mix will cut down
your workload, as it enables
you to do both in a single coat.
Paint jobs are best done on
clear days with low humidity.
Paint takes longer to dry
in cool rainy conditions.
When performing the job, wet the
roller cover for easier application.
Then fill the paint tray with
enough paint to get up to the grate.
Dip the roller cover
into the back reservoir,
and bring it up against the grate.
Roll it back and forth to
squeeze out excess paint
and evenly coat the roller.
Use continuous overlapping "M" or
"W" motions to coat the surface.
Keep the roller within the center of
the surface and not along the edge.
Start at the top, and work your way
down to control streaks on the surface.
Reapply the paint when the
roller makes a peeling sound.
Allow the paint to completely dry.
This may take a few hours.
Do a second coat if necessary following
the same procedure as the first coat.
If you're coating a
porch or stairs outdoors,
consider adding a little sand to the
paint if it's not already included.
This will create traction to
the slippery painted surface.
Once your finished
painting, pour excess paint
into the corresponding containers.
Lightly hammer the lid
onto the containers
with a mallet to ensure a proper seal.
Remove excess paint from your
paint brushes and other materials.
Then clean them with either paint
thinner for oil-based paint,
stain, and varnish or
soap and water for latex.
Finally, once all the paint is dry,
return your workspace to normal
by uncovering everything and setting
your furniture back in place.
