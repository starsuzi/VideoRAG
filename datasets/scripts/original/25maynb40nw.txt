all right it's Christmas Christmas cheer
Christmas Spirits all in the house some
people have a little bit more Christmas
spirit than others you could say just a
little bit more so we are doing a tad
duckin but look this is a got a bit of
Bonet Harvest twist to it it's got some
cranberries going to do a stuffing with
quinoa and some herbs it's going to be
poach it's going to be um chicken duck
turkey breast rolled up Real L style
like we did previously we did like a
chicken rad so check that out um it's
easy it's tasty it's going impress your
friends and family Merry
[Music]
Christmas so this is uh turkey stuff
with a duck and a chicken
um sounds pretty horrible but it's going
to be really tasty the idea is um
usually You' debone the whole bird and
you'd sort of wrap them all up in
amongst each other and then um bake it
off I'm doing it a different way I'm
using um chicken duck and uh turkey
breast and I'm going to Butterfly them
and then I'm going to roll them with
layers of kale in between them like a
rad and poach it off so it's a little
bit a little bit fancier a little bit
cleaner and easier to eat and it's
something that you will be able to do at
home opposed to deboning a whole chook
deboning a whole duck deboning a whole
turkey all right so what I like to do is
basically get all my components ready
first so butterflying all my um chicken
dark turkey breast beating it out till
about you know half a centm thick so
nice and thin so when you roll them
they'll cook evenly all right so that's
what you want your uh chicken breast to
look like my duck breast done here and
that's actually a turkey thigh not a
breast that I've deboned okay so that's
the meats done the next step is to make
our stuffing mix again simple stuffing
mix bondet Harvest style so first step
we'll be frying off your chopped off
onion and some garlic we're just going
to going to cook that it it's nice and
soft so while that's frying off come
over here we've got uh about 2 cups of
cooked Kimo so this is cooked this is
cooked Kimo yep let's take this back to
the food processor so that's going to go
with the quinoa so we got some
cranberries here some dried
cranberries got a handful of
nuts some almonds you can use whatever
nuts you got there is good just going to
add a whole bunch of parsley and a whole
bunch of coriander and then we're going
to give that a blitz till it all comes
together what are you doing just winging
it I think we've broken the food
processor that's about
right after so I'll get rid of this and
we'll start constructing so we're just
lining the bench with plastic and this
is what we're going to roll up or glad
wrap sorry this we're going to roll up
our um T ducking in before we poach it
got turkey
first so you don't want the stalks just
one layer
so that we'll let our chicken breast on
top lay down
that lay out some more
kale duck
breast where does this come from is this
French or what I I I think it tadd
duckin is from the US I could be wrong
leave me a comment but the r art is is
French so it's like a little bit of both
and whack our stuffing mi in there and
then you want to roll it up so keep it
nice and tight just lift the edges up
forceful not pretty at this
stage one more layer of glad
rat so that's what you're after also
known as a ruard meat log as as for the
cameraman's uh concept also known as a
ruard so rolling it up then you're going
to grab the
ends all the air out of it and then
you're going to roll it and that's going
to close it off and tighten it
up tie the end
off it's kind of like you've made a um
sausage yeah a big firm log of meat
sausage going to feed a lot of people
too and the best thing about this recipe
is whatever's left over I'll show you
how to make an epic frittata for the
next day
really that's the worst knot
ever is that cold water yep so just like
our chicken rad we're putting in cold
water and then we're going to bring it
up nice and slowly so as the the water
heats up everything sort of cooks with
it at the same
time
and that just makes sure it sinks just
holds it down so that's been about 25
minutes till about half an hour and it
feels ready so let's slice him open what
does feel ready mean well it's just the
way that the um the meat sort of bounces
back so you know how firm it
is I think she should be
right
how gorgeous that meat
looks the duck still bit perfect in pink
which is exactly how you want it
chicken's cooked all the way through
turkeyy cooked all the way through you
see how juicy and just beautiful it is
from all that um all those kale layers
you can see the separate layers so you
know what's going
