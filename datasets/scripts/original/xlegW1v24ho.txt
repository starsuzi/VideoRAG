hi guys it's nicole here from the 411
mamas and i'm from the channel mommy
tips by cole here on youtube and in
today's video i wanted to talk about
chores and allowance i want to ask you
guys number one
when did you start implementing chores
or giving your children
the duties of multiple chores in your
household and the second question i have
is how much do you give for allowance
like how much is okay
and not too much but not too little but
enough where they
you know find value in the dollar that
they're working hard for
um i honestly don't remember growing up
with a chore
allowance system i do remember asking
for allowance but it was not something
that was consistent i mean if i needed
something of course i would have to ask
and as long as i was deserving of it and
doing well in school and behaving well
then usually i would get it because
i was doing well
academically and also at home so
while i do want my kids to know that
chores are just
expected of them like i grew up with two
younger brothers that are 8 and 10 years
younger than me so it was just
already a given that i had to help out
with them help out around the house and
the older i got the more difficult
or the more responsibilities that i had
the more important responsibilities that
i had and
i didn't complain about it and i grew up
doing it and now that i am a mom myself
and have my own children it's just those
are things that have helped me growing
up so
i want my kids to know that they need to
pull their own weight around the house
especially we have a lot a big household
with three kids um
but i do want them to learn the value of
a dollar so it's like that's kind of why
i want to implement the whole allowance
system um
i'm not really like going by a book with
this i'm just kind of learning as i go i
feel like
i tried to do this with my stepdaughter
when she was younger but it wasn't
something that was consistent because
just as i grew up
being that it was a given it was kind of
a given for her once she learned how to
do certain things it was just routine
and i do want these things to be routine
for my kids and while many of the chores
that are on our list are things they
already helped that they already helped
with or have been helping with in their
own little way even when they were
really super super little like i have
videos and pictures of like my son or my
daughter like helping with laundry or
helping sleep the floor or bringing the
garbage to the door so that daddy or
somebody can take it outside so
these chores are nothing new to them
it's just that i wanted to create a
chart and a system
where they can keep track and also help
them be organized and
um
just be held accountable for the things
they do
on a daily not just when they feel like
helping it or when i have to
say to do it two or three times for them
to do it but most times um
when i asked them of something even
before this whole allowance thing um
they would do it so i thought this was
just natural to just start this and i'm
going to show you guys what i did i got
a two pack
chart from the dollar store actually
maybe a year or so ago and they still
have these in a dollar store and i use
one of the charts to be a job chart and
i organize it in a way that you know
helps us and i did it with the kids
emeline actually rolled a bunch of
um
chores that were chores in her mind that
she thought that they should be helping
with and then i
narrowed it down and transferred it to
our chart based on what was the space is
available on our chart now you could go
about this in any way you want i'm not a
diy or creative at all so i'm not the
type to get all crafty and make my own
although i've seen so many amazing and
creative
ideas on pinterest
um
but you can go about this anyway i feel
like there are also
printouts you can get online but i opted
to try this out and i'll probably adjust
it as they get older as we go and see
what works for us but i want to do this
video to kind of share what we're doing
so far
and i will show that in a clip right now
so this is our job chart excuse my voice
i'm losing it we're about to leave for a
vacation but
um we just fill it out sunday through
friday
and brush teeth fix bed clean room take
vitamins homework study
help cook set table clear table helper
dishes up with trash sweet floor
clean up toys baths prep clothes read
bedtime listen no yelling help with
groceries laundry and vacuum
and be assigned
um
initials per
chore something different every day and
then they check off and they're
done so so far it's working out pretty
good for us um we've been through one
week of this and they got their first
allowance on sunday my husband and i
both decided to give them five dollars
each every sunday after they've
completed a week's worth of chores um
for the most part they didn't have too
many x's
um if they didn't have to do it that day
a line was just drawn through it and
yeah they were really excited i think
five dollars is reasonable although it
it was more than i thought that i would
want to give because we have three kids
but
we're just going to start it off at that
that's why i want to see what you guys
comment and what your system is or what
you personally grew up with doing
um i'm really excited for how this is
going so far
even my son is always like can i do
something more so i can get more checks
and it's just nice to see the kids
receive it very well
and be excited about helping and you
know i feel like for them it's more
gratifying with getting the checks and
just visually seeing that they're
completing all these tasks to help
in the house versus the whole
getting money thing
what they did with the money is they put
it in their big jar that we've been
collect they've been collecting money
for disney world and we'll be
um bringing that to disney world and
they can buy whatever they want when
they go there um and of course they have
the option to save it or use it for
other things hopefully in the future i
saw somebody give me an idea
on one of my posts on facebook or to uh
instagram
saying that at the end of every month
she has her kids put half of it in the
bank
and have them keep half so i feel like
that's something i want to do down the
line
and yeah that's pretty much it for this
video let me know your thoughts let all
of us moms know your thoughts on chores
and allowance in the comments down below
and i'll see you in my next video bye
you
