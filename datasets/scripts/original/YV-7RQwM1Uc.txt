welcome back to the bench everybody
we're at video four of our five-part
series here on daily seeds and the
seedlings and a little process that we
go through so um let's get right into it
uh this video has been highly
anticipated uh highly
requested and it's been a long time
coming actually it's been probably a
year since I launched my daily seeds you
can see that these seedlings are ready
to be planted right so the question
always is what do you guys do next next
what do you plant them in um what kind
of soil do you use you know all sorts of
questions and um this is going to be a
great video because if I don't cover
something you can put the questions Down
Below in the comments area and as a um
as a group we can uh answer those
questions so you can see today's
actually June 22nd we're in Northern
Ohio and this batch of seedlings for the
first three rows to your left here we've
got uh seedlings that were planted or
transplanted into this pot on 6 I'm
sorry 62 so 20 days you got 20 days of
growth here we've got about 4 4 and 1/2
in on some of these seedlings so they're
doing really well in the
soil uh the soil that we use by the way
is called Ritz organic
um I've got a bag of it sitting over
there it's about 38 quartz and you can
pick up that for about 20 to 20 I would
say between 22 and
$25 um and it can go a long way um it's
it's very expensive if you're using
purely Ritz organic so what we've tried
to do is we tried to mix some top soil
in with the richz organic so it still
has the good nutrients in the soil and
it goes much further
so that's where we're at so we've got
ahead we've gone ahead and we've already
packed this full of soil ready to be
transplanting seedlings into and another
key is make sure that you're noting
every one of your crosses because you
want to keep Good Records you want to
know the genetics and that's going to
help you down the road Road
um in your future gardening Endeavors so
make sure that you're labeling okay so
okay let's get to it so we've got a
group of seedlings here I'm going to
post the pictures of smokey eyes and
Linda Sierra and then that's by helot
Trope Island and Linda Sierra so you're
going to see the pictures to the right
here these were harvested on
8414 so last August so these seedlings
or I'm sorry these seeds well now
seedlings um
um you know they're almost a year old so
they're doing well and as long as you
keep them good and refrigerated and
they're not put away wet um your daily
seeds can last up to a year uh and be
just fine so there's that little tip
there so what do we do next
um basically I'm going to clear I've
went ahead and I've
got um soil try to get up to the top but
it does sink over time you want to mix
that soil up loosen up cuz you're going
to have Roots here that are about an
inch long and you want to kind of build
the soil up around the roots um in the
way that the roots are already growing
you don't want to damage the roots at
all so we're going to take a couple of
these seedlings out here uh let's take a
look at some of these guys they look
really good um I've got them upside down
so I like to grab by the plant side not
the root
side just
because and and don't get me wrong these
guys are strong they're not as delicate
as what it looks
like they're ready to go they're ready
to thrive in this dirt so you can see
this guy is really off to a good
start and the roots are kind of growing
sideways on this one you see so we're
going to put them in like that we're
going to put them in just like that um
don't try to reroute them very much like
I said they are pretty
strong and they'll find their their way
to the
bottom they'll find their way to the
bottom so um what you want to do is you
just want to take a little bit of soil
there
um and just kind of compress it a little
bit make sure the green part's sticking
up
obviously
and that'll be a good start for it and
like I said in about 3 weeks it'll start
to look like these guys okay so that's
how we do the transplant there uh let's
do another one let me take take another
one out here show you oh here's a really
green guy here wow this one's really big
this one's actually got look at that
look at that if you can see it my
camera's good enough
but there we
go okay and again we're just going
to sort of clear out loosen up some of
that soil there that may have been
packed down because this is going to
take over you know we're we're
transplanting seedlings in here that
they're not all getting transplanted at
once we're kind of growing at our own
pace right
now slowly but
surely so we don't have enough to fill
the tray right now
so again we're going to pack down that
soil around
the around the seedling there just sort
of Tamp it down a little bit
make sure all the roots are
covered let's bring this over
here so there you have it and once
you've got that in all you're going to
do is give a little bit of uh
water if I can find it here
there it goes a little bit of water to
keep it to a good start get it off to a
good start I should say and I've made my
handy dandy tag
here so there's the date the cross and
all we're going to do is make sure it's
in that bed and the rule that we have in
our garden if you can see the
writing anything in front of that
writing unless there's another tag
is going to be the same cross so you can
save on your tags
and try to eliminate the labeling every
single tray all right guys I hope you
