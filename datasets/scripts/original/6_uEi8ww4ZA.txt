now i'm going to show you the technical
technique
for cutting a straight line
Remember-I have to do this
with a camera in one hand my- left hand
and I have to Cut the 
Line with my other hand
Now- most painters= can Cut a Line-We are going to cut a Line
right along the top of this,
this Seam  right here... right here
Up to this Seam, Now
beginners WILL use tape 
an Expert does not need tape
Tape is only used for SPEED
Cause- Masking Tape takes a long time to put on, and a LONG time to take off
It is Expensive
and slows the job down, especially by the bid
Now are paint brushes- They come in many , Varied Sizes...
this is a four-inch,  three and a half inch
same as this.. This..is what is called a Fence Brush = You notice how Thick it is??
NOw...A fence brush
let's just...These are smaller brushes and they go down to one inch wide
Now , a fence brush , back in the day. (past), 
was when they had wooden fences . You had too...
get the paint on the fence 
and remember
the first rule about painting
the very FIRST RULE about Painting..
is to get the paint
on the surface
and then we'll go over that too
now for the technique. You want to have a
bucket of  water with you= most people paint in the 
summer: it's hot
you also wanna
if you have
uh... paint left over from the day before 
One way is putting plasting around the bucket and leaving it there WITHOUT AIR 
getting to it
it will not Dry Out
and...you can use the paint day after day
or what you can do is wrap plastic around the tops right here. 
and that will be fine.. Some people say, put the brushes in a freezer, but oh..
thats great- if you have a freezer on the job site
if you wrap them in  plastic-  the best way is
to clean every day
Okay?? That is the BEST way
and to get all the little paint flakes off , use a WIRE BRUSH like I showed you in 
previous videos
Okay, we have water...we have this 
I am going to use
uh...four-incher here
you can see how
uhm....
The bristles are not all together
what I like to do is Dunk it in Water. Water is Your Friend
Water is not going hurt this paint
THIS paint is water-based
if you think
for one second
that you're going to drop any paint on a
concrete
Which...I do
Paint DOES NOT come off Concrete
OIL PRIMER NEVER COMES OFF!!
it is a Pain in the Ass
especially with the hot sun
as soon as it hits concrete
YOU ARE SCREWED ...!!! So, we have this and
now we work on the Technique
I have a 4-inch RAGDOLL ROLLER in here ..trying to take this off..
I was going to take..
I will use my other hand 
but i wanted to show you one of the tecniques we use for
keeping paint in its place 
Okay, and we use a little tiny gallon uh...
strainer right here
what we want to do..I will switch hands here 
First , we have to LOAD the paint brush
LOAD it with Paint
and loading the paint brush...
loading the paint brush 
does not mean just DUNK IT IN HERE, and you are done.
You want to Dunk it in to where 
the bristle viriles 
uh... will widen out like this... and it will HOLD alot of paint on the INSIDE 
like this - you want to go..
about that much.. JUST that much..
then you go like this- Ok? What that does is LOAD the paint 
up INTO  the bristles. Now-
our  technique
first of all... we want to get about inch
see if i can
get this right.. and inch below. what i'm
doing is I'm putting a Uhm....
A reserve of paint , right here
now- what i want to do... with my hand at a  forty-five degree angle 
and you want to HOLD YOUR BREATH.
and you want to Twist your Brush
and MOVE UP to that line 
Then what you want to do 
is- you take your brush 
you go back down and dab it again 
and you keep Going Across... now- If you run out of paint 
you want to come back down- Remember- THERE IS NO ONE-COAT PAINT!!!
everything IS TWO-COAT !!
A good paint job is 3 millimeters thick
and you dont want to have alot
of paint, on the TOP of the brush
okay- because what that'll do is that
will
cascade
into
the uh, uh, ceiling or top, and that is not what you want. What you want to do is take the paint down here and
push it up into..this  
Let GRAVITY work for you - You push the paint up towards this line..
or you want to hold your breath- which I
am not doing
then you do NOT want to MOVE your HEAD! You want to look DIrectly- EXACTLY where you are painting
You want to be as STILL, as a Professional 
marksman. Now, a good painter can paint in BOTH directions 
Now that is your first coat..Your second coat 
all you'll need to do= is come up to and 1/8 inch of that top line 
You won't even need to get close to it
Now, if we...You..are going to lunch or going anywhere 
The paint on the brush is already drying 
DROP IT IN THE WATER !!!
WATER..IS..YOUR..FRIEND !!
Okay?? It is not going to hurt anything. You can..
Dunk it in the water as 
much as you want
Now- what a good painter will do..is..
CUT his Line across HERE 
and usually when we Cut our Lines , we cut them...
sat at..the...
right Above this Light 
the body underneath..the..
the...ah...
Soffett!!  If that is the way you are going to do it.
Or= we will cut a line 
around
this concrete wall, here
Now, someones already done it , Uh...
badly... so I had..
had, to come more OUT with the paint since I last painted it 
But- Cutting a Line is ; IT TAKES PRACTICE TO DO IT...!!
Once you learn how- 
And BELIEVE ME, it is alot easier to do with 
TWO hand and not a camera 
in one hand
but this is your first coat=  your second
coat
you put your..
Your paint down here..and DAB it UPwards 
You want to move upwards with a wave puddle 
and then just "puddle" it  right across
and if you run out of paint..just dip some more paint and GO SLOW!!@!
IF you start making a mess...
then you're going too damn fast, now remember-
a professional painter
does not get it on his hands he doesn't
get it on his clothes (hopefully)
he doesn't get it on the ground
he gets it, (knock, knock).
on the object to be painted 
so that's how you do that that's a
technique- Remember
So that is how you do that..That is the tecnique . Remember- Do Not move your Head LOOK EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE PAINTING 
take a deep breath and hold your breath
when you do your line . The Line may only be a 
foot long like this one
or..14 inches 
and they you Stop
reload your brush - Take another Breath 
and do it again !!
and with practice you'll be able to do
this= upside-down, backwards and with both
hands
but no one teaches the technique
and i'm
trying to..ah..
to show how that's done. Okay thanks for watching.
