welcome to hungarians in the kitchen
i'm monica and this is my mom marta um
today we are going to make one of my
favorite meals growing up called
gouliash so um we start off
with what onions mix
onions yeah okay first pickle onion nice
sized onion
yes small pieces and then what do we do
once we have this cut up into
finely dice this is we put it in the pan
a smaller pan because this is going to
be separate
from the veggies is there oil already in
there yes
and we're using virgin olive oil olive
oil
and then we start today we saute this
and then we cut the meat
small little squares and we put it there
paprika and then the meat okay
we've got one side and this is nothing
that
the shepherds were doing at night
and they wanted to have a good
meal after a long day yeah yeah
and that's right they whatever vegetable
they find
on the on the field they put it there
sometimes they did
with lamb sometimes with beef
but i think pork is the one mostly
this is this is the way how we did it in
my mother's kitchen
and this is in like transylvania style
and again transylvania is a is a
territory kind of like the appalachian
mountains are in the united states
it's a mountainous region um that goes
north and south
uh well most mountainous regions you
don't know france
yeah and but it used to belong to
hungary
so you know the part of the austrian
hungarian empire before it belonged to
rome
all right so we have our one onion
nicely diced up
and we're gonna go ahead and put it into
a cooking pot
and i'm put probably gonna put in about
a tablespoon
or so yeah is that good
okay
and then so
we have our pork tenderloin that we
purchased from a local farm
and one of the things in preparing pork
tenderloin
is you want to get it ready before you
cut it up there's
a thin membrane and some of it is is fat
but
thin membrane you can get kind of
underneath it
and kind of almost tear it off
so if you haven't really worked with
tenderloin before
this is something that it's just a
little kind of cleaning tool
but again this is the very good part of
the pork
that you use for this dish because
it gives it flavor and a good flavor yes
so now what we want to do you have said
that the important thing is that we cut
it into small pieces
small squares okay so first
why don't you do it first you cut it
long like this
okay we've got
into strips yes
and then you cut like
this so they look like they're about
quarter
to half an inch squares
or not quite squares
well you know you've got like this okay
okay
okay so what we've done now is we are
using a three-quart
uh pot and we've sauteed the onions till
they're nice
golden and soft and we're gonna go and
add
about a tablespoon of wonderful
hungarian paprika
and i'm going to stir real quick we
don't want it to burn
and this is a lovely flavor that is the
most hungarian recipes that i and we'll
go ahead and
add in our pork tenderloin that we
nicely cut up and you just want to get
all of that
mixed in really well before you add your
water in
to really bring out that flavor of the
paprika i'm gonna turn this
down a little bit so the paprika doesn't
burn
okay and we're gonna go ahead
and just add a little bit initially
so we're going to add some more water
and we're just going to add enough to
kind of cover most of the meat
a little more okay
i'm gonna give that a nice stir again
bring the heat up to medium
okay that's plenty of water
to allow that to cook and then we'll add
our salt
and go ahead and do about a half
teaspoon of salt
a few shakes of fresh pepper
and about an eighth of a teaspoon of
caraway
seeds and we'll cook that on medium
maybe medium high
a little bit more water just a little
bit okay looks like
more water because there's yeah so then
some of the meat is still
there
and now we prepare the vegetables okay
all right and for a richer flavor
we put in yeah for the meat
we are going to put in a tomato
small finely chopped pieces
and a pepper so
once we've got these finely diced
we add it in the reason why it's a good
idea to
um finely dice it is that you know you
really don't want to necessarily
take a bite out of these vegetables it's
more
um meant to be used for flavoring
so essentially it'll somewhat
you know kind of disintegrate
and just become part of the sauce
of the stew
you can see it's now nicely boiling away
and some of the meat is beginning to
cook the thing about pork tenderloin is
that even though you know one can look
at this and say oh well that's cooked
really isn't you want it to cook for
a bit of time and we'll let you know
what that is once we're done
um so that it's nice and soft and
very tender cover that back up
so now we're to the portion where we're
going to
essentially prepare our vegetables and
we
prepare those in a separate pot we're
going to be using an
8 quart soup pot and
we'll let you tell you how it goes we
we're going to use
potatoes and really you can use any kind
of potato but these are the ones that we
chose
um three parsnips and it looks like and
they're really good-sized parsnips so if
you get smaller ones you might want to
use some
some some more and then we have six nice
sized carrots here
i'm going to peel all those and cut them
up really nicely
and cook them so one question i had
about luis is
when do people make this what are they
here
this is something that you can do all
year round i mean that is not
something that uh like cabbage only
winter
or somewhere this is this is something
that you can do all year round
like in this little round i think
so they're not too big so what other
vegetables can you use
oh you can use whatever you like you can
use celery if you want
also that that would give an extra good
flavor
what about things like leek or i'm
thinking of things i put in
i never said i never used that so
i really don't know but i would i don't
think
i don't think it would spoil it because
but these are the basics but usually
yeah so if you
if someone really likes sleek or
mushrooms
then i i would say add it in right
mushrooms are that's the thing
really helpful for you so really this
doesn't take long especially
you know with a helper in the kitchen
it's always nice to cook with someone
not be doing it all by yourself
i love the parsnip this is such a
good extra flavor gift
for any kind of soup i just
love it how about something like
celery yak which could you put something
like that or is that too
because that's a kind of strong flavor
isn't it yeah that's definitely
it would be overpowering but in hungary
in the market
you can find um
parsley root which
looks like the parsnips but
it it's kind of different a little bit
the flavor is different what about
something like a turnip
did you put a turn in there no don't
belong to the soup basically vegetables
i don't think turnips this is more of a
stew
yes now the one of the things that
i think makes this a little bit
different than just
a regular stew is that at the end
we add what you call dumplings yes
and i actually don't really know the
english name for it
it's that is dumpling that's an english
name
in hungarian
i guess i always think of dumplings as
filled with something
like at a chinese restaurant you know
they fill it with pork or
yeah because there is no other name in
english
for no cad leak in hungarian no ken
there we go some hungarian words
it's not really a good guy so that is a
secret now we're going to be doing
something a little bit different
and that is we're going to make ours
gluten-free
it will have egg in it
um but i'm really excited about this
recipe because
i think it'll work for those who are
sensitive to gluten
normally you would just use white flour
egg and water
and they look like this
this
oh those are really small pieces well
not too small but
you know like this
so this is going to cook really fast
so is this a recipe that somebody would
make
on the weekday or is this really a
weekend recipe
really big day weekend doesn't matter
depend your time my mother
because she had time she made that on
weekdays
also i guess you could make it
like really the night before even and
then it's better even the next day
or you can just prepare the veggies
to cut them up cut them off you can you
can prepare the meat a night before
and then you come home from work you
just
put the veggies in the pot
because the meat is ready
so and the veggie doesn't take a very
long time to
to cook
here these are larger you were
thinking that those are too small i was
that's what you said no these are very
small
well i was just making an observation i
think they're fine
you have some more children so you have
to think about them
with small mouths especially elise
she's a little girl she gets scared when
she sees a big
huge potato in her plate
how i'm gonna eat that so we went ahead
and just tasted one of the
pieces of pork tenderloin and discovered
that
um there was insufficient salt
we're going to go ahead and add another
half teaspoon bringing it up to a full
table
a teaspoon and
same thing with the caraway i'm gonna
add in another
eighth of a teaspoon bringing it up to a
quarter
teaspoon and
the tenderloin is still
not as my mom said not even halfway
cooked yet
so this has been about 30 minutes now
and we'll probably check it in another
15 minutes
and we have it on medium low where it's
boiling
because you really do want it to cook
you don't want it to just simmer
so we have all our wonderful vegetables
chopped up
and we're adding it into an acorn pot
there's no water or oil in there
a quart just four cups
another quart
and that's two and a half quarts
and we probably need
a little bit more okay let's do another
two cups
which will be three quarts good
salt
even though we have salt in the other
one we need salt again in this
yes hold the veggies okay so we'll do
half a teaspoon
that's a full teaspoon okay and then you
put
garlic
that much we use a half a teaspoon yes
caraway seeds
and then we've got pepper
no okay no pepper turn it on
yes medium let it cook covered
covered yes
maybe a half hour we're gonna taste
okay so it's been about a half hour
and we tested the vegetables and they're
nice and soft
but it's not salty enough so we're going
to go ahead and add another half
teaspoon
and we also noticed that there weren't
enough caraway seeds before so we ended
up actually
adding another half teaspoon making it
an entire teaspoon of caraway seeds
so now that these are done we'll do
is take our pork tenderloin
that's been cooking and it's nice and
tender and we're gonna add the entire
thing
in
look at all that flavor this is why we
needed to use any cork pot
as you can see it's now full and then
we'll let this
just cook for another 15 minutes or so
together
and while we wait for that
we're gonna go ahead and make the
noodles
which is an important part of this
recipe
so now we're ready to make our
gluten-free hungarian noodles
and what i have here is brown rice flour
i have something called sorghum flour i
have
arrowroot flour you can also use tapioca
starch
i have almond flour and i have something
called
psyllium husk and i have ground chia
seeds
which i ground myself in an electric
coffee grinder
and what i did i just tested this before
is i just took a rounded tablespoon
an actual tablespoon as opposed to a
measuring tablespoon
so it's not it's not really an exact
science but it worked so i'm just going
to repeat that
and then with the almond flour it was
about half
okay so i'll repeat that again and the
psyllium husk was
about a third
and we'll also add some salt so
are we going to double this are we going
to triple it yes
so let me do that again yeah then we go
ahead and
mix that together a little bit
unless you don't have to make it
gluten-free and then you make it regular
flour
right so add in one egg
nice farm egg
and then i didn't add the salt last time
just sprinkle sprinkle sprinkle salt
yeah
no more all right this is not enough no
let me put it
oh dear so that's probably a quarter of
a teaspoon
or so maybe half
and then we begin mixing
now we're going to measure the
the water in here so that we can tell
you exactly how much we're using
instead of just saying oh some until you
get the right consistency
first we add half a cup
that wasn't too much it was
oh dear so we're just going to add a
little bit
more flour on choosing brown rice
and we'll see how that works
so maybe start off with a quarter cup of
water instead of half a cup like i did
still a little too runny
for my mom so use a little sword gun
again if you don't need to use
gluten-free flour then just
use your white
enriched flour and
about a quarter cup of water and an egg
and you can see how
it's gonna get thicker
will it get thicker
because of the cilium we can put some
more psyllium
so this is still a little bit too
volatile yeah
that's too much uh two running two soft
that was chia seed and psyllium husk and
about
let's say maybe a teaspoon of each
and sometimes it takes a little bit of
time to
thicken up
i think i'll add a little bit of
arrowroot because that's also
a thickener
it looks like we
drink about three tablespoons of each
is that better
if it thickens a little bit then it's
gonna be good okay
yeah we wait a few minutes
to thicken so it's still too runny so
now i'm gonna add
about a tablespoon of almond flour
and that should dry it out a little bit
i think now it's cool okay
it's really more of a taste yeah if you
can kind of see
it like you wanted to um what is that
like a
glob as opposed to a runny
feeling right is that good yes okay
yes
and all this time our
stew is cooking in the background
now we're ready to put in our noodles
and what we'll do is
take a small amount
and we
gently put it into the soup and you want
to lower your spoon
into the soup
the stew because that way it'll come off
very nicely
and what it does initially is it falls
to the bottom
and once it's cooked it'll rise to the
top
and you don't want to make them too big
because they do grow in size
and we'll let these cook for about
10 or so minutes and then we want to
taste them
make sure that they're completely cooked
on the inside
and not gummy
i think you have enough oh so we don't
have to use all of it
i don't think so because then it's gonna
just
okay soak up all the yeah okay
so as you can see the noodles are
beginning to rise up and it's only
really been about three or four minutes
but we did increase the heat
to make sure that it was coming to a
boiling point
and they were cooking
so we've gone ahead and served ourselves
and one of the things i've noticed that
i really love
is when i take a spoonful i have
lots of little and this is a small
teaspoon too i've got
um potato i've got pepper i've got
meat and that's because we cut
everything really nice and small
and let me taste it
wow
the corvette sheet that's really
that's really what makes this ghoulia
yes really wonderful
the one thing that my mom noticed
is that and you saw how large the
noodles were
she said that they are much too large so
next time i think i'll use a teaspoon to
measure them out
and again they took about 10 minutes to
cook
but if you are using just um
you know your traditional white flour
it's going to take about five minutes
but um
until they come up and just check it
because they did come on top
but they were still a little bit gummy
and still needed to cook a little bit
yeah so that would be the only thing
so thanks for joining us we hope that
you make this wonderful dish for your
family
you
