red chili powder so I'm just going to
use my hands and mix everything

refrigerate it for a couple
hours I have some oil heating here once
the oil is hot start frying the chicken
just slowly drop in one by
one make sure each chicken is separate
and they're not sticking to each
other the chicken looks done so I'm
going to take out the chicken now
and I'm going to repeat the process
until I fry all the chicken this is the
final batch of chicken so now I'm going
to add a few Curry leaves into the oil
