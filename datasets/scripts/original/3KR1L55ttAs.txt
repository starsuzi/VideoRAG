hi everyone today I'm going to show you
how to make a pillowcase dress these are
the patterns that I use this one is from
size 6 months to 4T and this one size 3
to
8 so these are the numbers 6 months to
4T and 3 to
eight we can see that the materials that
you're going to be needing are a good
pair of fabric scissors um if you can
one of these boards I got this one at
Walmart for I think it was
$15 and you're going to need
pins you'll need a Sharpie or a fabric
pen and you're going to need
two different colors of
fabric you'll also made
ribbon if I can find
it yes you'll also need ribbon this will
be for to tie the shoulder
straps as you can
see in the picture
here you will need an ironing board and
you'll also need an
iron
so let's get started first thing I'm
going to
do
is I'm going to measure my
fabric again I'll have all the
measurements down in the description bar
I'm going to make this one a size
2T so first thing you want to do is you
want to get the fabric that you're going
to use for the main color for the main
upper
part for up here this part up
here and we're going to cut
it what I usually like to
do is I usually
like to iron my fabric
first
just make sure there's no
creases or bolds you want it to be very
smooth
okay this I'm using one yard of fabric
of
cotton
and with this with one yard of fabric
you can actually make two pillowcase
dresses that are under the
size three I
think three or four I'm not meure but
you can actually make two two dresses
from one yard of
fabric so now we're
going to
measure and cut our
Fabric and for the 2T you're going to
want to cut uh 15 in from the neck
down just for this top part here
remember just for this top part it's
going to be 15 in from up here down to
here and then it's going to be 10 in
across
so what I like to do first is I like to
cut about an inch off of one end that
way it gives it a straight
edge
so I usually will put it up against the
line
now and you may
use a fabric pan
but I usually use the Sharpie you don't
ever see the the marks they make anyway
so they're always
hidden so you just cut off 1
inch and then we're going to measure 15
in from the top to the bottom so line it
up and make sure this part over here is
straight all the way to
15
right here so you're going to line up
your
ruler make a
line just like
that then we're going to measure 10 in
from this side to this side this is the
folded side right here this is the open
side over here this side is all folded
forgot to mention that so we're cutting
like this the long ways so this side is
part we're going to cut off all this
open stuff we want to keep the folded
side where it's all folded we don't want
to cut here so we're going to cut over
here on the open side so we're going to
turn it this way and we're going to
measure 10
in and we're going to
cut here is exactly 10 in so let me just
cut off make it even
[Applause]
just like that so it's 10 in side to
side and 15 in up and down cuz now we're
going to cut the the
sleev so what for a 2T what I usually do
is I'll
measure five 6 in down no 5 Ines down
and 2 in in so this is the open end make
sure to do it on the on the open end
right
here I'm going to do it on this
side so I'm going to measure 5 in Down
The Long waists and 2 Ines in the short
way so I'm just going to put a
little Mark and we're going to
cut this way and we're going to curve up
that way like
this so it comes out looking like
that now this again I told you was going
to going to make two pillowcase dresses
so you're going to end up having four
pieces and to make one pillowcase dress
you only need two so I'm going to take
the other two and I'm going to put them
to the
side and now we are
going to
cut the bottom piece so you're going to
get your other color that you want to
use for the bottom which is going to be
down here on the bottom here
and for this one of course we need to
iron iron the fabric first is what I
like to always
do
okay so of course I want to always cut
off it about an inch on the top that way
it's a straight
cut I'm going to draw a line 1 in
in and I'm going to cut it
off I usually do an inch you can do do
it however you choose to do
it okay now for the bottom part is going
to be 7 in down and then 10 in across
again so I'm going to Mark 7 in
down we're going to cut
this and then of course we're going to
do 10 in in which this is exactly 10 in
so let me just cut off a little bit on
the
edge oh and you'll also need a sewing
machine I'm not sure if I mentioned that
at the beginning but you're also going
to need a sewing
machine okay so now you
have your bottom
pieces
