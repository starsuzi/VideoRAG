Setting up your Karcher pressure washer
really is very easy.
All you need is a water supply
and somewhere save to plug in.
Every Karcher pressure washer come supplied
with a standard hose pipe adapter
But if you are drawing from a water but the suction hose
and filter kit screws directly onto your machine.
A mains fed garden hose pipe
should be at least 15 meters long
This will help give you an even supply, and use a
free-flowing hose pipe adapter  on the end of your hose.
Connect the water supply and turn on the
tap
then squeeze the trigger until water is running freely
through the machine in a steady stream.
This will remove air locks in the system.
Now connect to a power supply turn on
your Karcher pressure washer at the switch
and you will hear the motor
activate for a few seconds then stop.
This is quite normal it's just as the  machine
is pressurizing itself.
Got that?, great. Let's have some fun
let's clean with Karcher.
To pack you Karcher pressure washer away
turn off the machine and turn off the water supply
Pull the trigger to release the remaining pressure
 then remove the hose pipe from the machine.
Removed the high pressure hose and to
flush through the last few drops of water left
inside the pump turn the machine back on 
for five seconds and then turn it off again.
This action is especially important
during the winter months.
Excellent your pressure washer is now
ready to be stored away,
ready for its next Karcher adventure.
