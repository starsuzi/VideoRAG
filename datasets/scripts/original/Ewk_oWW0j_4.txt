okay I'm going to try to cook an egg on
my Lodge
griddle don't know that this will
work out of
heat it's already preheated so we're
going to put about a
tablespoon of butter
let this do
this kind spread that out a little
bit come on
okay this probably won't work but we'll
see okay give it give it a few
minutes but's already Browning
h
I guess that looks okay
starting to turn a little bit
opaque but I think it needs just a few
more minutes before it'll slide
around or maybe it won't slide around I
don't know
see see I want to
slide possibly force
it so there you
go I guess that slides around
brown butter
but let see if I can flip this
sucker which I doubt it
can
shoot come
on
FP there you
go it
flipped and nothing is sticking it's
hard to see in the video camera I mean
there's a little piece of egg but that's
not stuck
on lots of brown butter oh that's big
that's all brown butter all that's brown
butter looks like it's cooking pretty
hard and I don't like a hard egg
so there it is looks nice and
runny nothing stuff just one little
piece of egg you see here is not stuck
of course now I have a lot of that
yellow
okay good deal
