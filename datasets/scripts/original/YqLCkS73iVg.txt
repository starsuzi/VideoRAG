so here's my rose
garden and uh unfortunately I found a
nasty pest they're known as aphids
they're soft bodied little insects that
get right under the leaves and they they
get on the rose buds and they suck out
the juices they'll eventually kill kill
your uh plants or vegetables they've
gotten to it so I'm going to teach you
guys an organic and effective and an
economical way of um Exterminating these
guys
what it does is um here it
is it's just this dish detergent what
you simply do is you mix 6 tablespoons
per gallon okay if you're going to use
two gallons is going to be 12
tablespoons what you do is simply uh put
the detergent in there first okay and
then add the water and you would just
stir it with some little stick you don't
want to shake it up or else it's going
to be um all bubbly and
you know but anyways the key is you
don't want to do this in the ear you
want to do it early morning or in the
evening when the sun is kind of down or
else you're going to fry up your your
your plants and your rose bushes so now
is a good time to do it see these aphids
right here so what you simply do I
already mixed it up and I'm almost done
with the job that I want to show youall
so you just spray
underneath okay a lot of people say that
you want to you know rinse them off with
water afterwards or you know shoot a jet
of water to get rid of the aphids first
but once you do that then they're
already on the ground and sprang them
down doesn't really dry them out and
kill them so what I simply do is I don't
rinse them off I don't all I simply do
is go straight on the aphids while
they're there so they can get a dose of
their medicine here okay just spray them
off just like
that okay I got this here from Harbor
Freight for about 12 bucks there's uh
coupons available for 20 or 25% off you
know came out to like 10 bucks and it's
a really good way of um
applying this dish detergent so in a
nutshell just spray off spray them
off okay I'm not going to rinse them off
with water
afterwards okay all you
do you want to make sure you get the
bottom of the leaves
as you can see
here and that should do the trick when I
come out tomorrow they should be gone
hopefully pretty sure they will be and
uh gets rid of your uh aphids so hope
