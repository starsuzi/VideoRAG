today I will be showing you how to make
this piece sign here and it's very will
be very similar to the coloring on this
one and also I'll talk you through how
to make this Mercedes sign during the
tutorial for the pie sign you'll need
about 44 rubber bands in total and for
the Mercedes sign you'll need about 40
and you want to kind of use a hardish um
jelly rubber band it's firmer and your
creational out a little stiffer so let's
get started the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to make the um
inside we are going to
take whatever color you want to use I'm
using a pink so I'm going to take a
single doubling it and from the top of
our
Loom we're putting it from the first to
the second peg in the center again
single
double from the second to the third and
now we're taking our next next color and
mine will be purple so single
double coming down the third to the
fourth Peg single double and I'm putting
it diagonally from the fourth Center to
the side um fourth Peg purple again
single
double from the center fourth through
the side fourth the other side
diagonally again another single double
down one
and repeat that for the other
side and then the center so that's all
purple now if you want the Mercedes
signs don't put the center like I am now
you just want to do the sides here so
now my next color will be kind of this
Peach so I'm taking single double I'm
coming down one
one and then single double down the
other side now if you're doing the
Mercedes signs you just should just have
this and down these two sides and that's
it so for the um piece sign we're going
to go ahead and take our take our peach
color again and coming down in the
center so we have three Peach down the
center and now we're going to continue
two extra down the center your next
color I'm doing yellow single double and
down twice single double again and the
rubber band that I'm using are jelly
like the harder rubber band so it forms
the pie sign better it's stiffer so you
might want to use that I would recommend
it and now we want to cap each end here
there should be three the tip with the
same color band so the center is yellow
so I'm capping that off four
times or looping it three times create
four
Loops again the side and for the
Mercedes you should cap these two off
four times 2 3
4 so that's one 2 3 four so you're
looping it three times to create four
Loops so now we are ready to hook and we
are going to start at the
center go under the cat band grab the
bottom two bands and looping it onto
itself creating teardrops and we're
coming up our
Center all the way to
this Peg there the fourth from the
top where it all meets now we're going
to do either side let's go ahead and go
under grab the bottom
two and looping it onto
itself and you're going to come right to
the center and do the other side same
looping go under the cat bands grab the
bottom
twoo make sure you see tear drops as
you're
going now we're ready to Loop up the
center
let's go ahead and pull all those bands
back grabbing only the bottom
two and very gently carefully there's
might be tension release any tension and
looping it onto itself and you should
see the tear drop catching your rubber
band and loop the
rest all the way up to the
arrow and now we are ready to take that
same color mine is the pink and we're
going to double dou it take a single and
double
it and we're going to put it through and
you're going to need another hook cuz
this will need to hold for the um most
of our project just to keep it in place
or just some holding instrument to kind
of hold this rubber band in place there
so now let's go ahead and take it off
the
loom just
carefully so this is the middle of our
pie
sign
your Mercedes sign should just have
three prongs this one the center top one
and then the two side ones like that
let's go ahead and make the piece the
outer
ring and we'll start with our p
pink take a single we're going to take a
single on doubling this whole project so
single double starting at the top of our
Loom and we're just going right around
the perimeter of our Loom here so single
double I'm coming down diagonally and
then coming
down
four single double three and you can do
use whatever color you one I'm just
doing this Arrangement four and for this
one I came down three but it's up to you
if you want to come down four I want to
change it up a little make the fading a
little bit more on this one and let's go
ahead and do the other side same thing
same color single
double single double coming down
four make sure you push your rubber band
down
and now we're going to our next color
I'm using purple so single double we're
coming down
three just on the
outside
two
three always single double again repeat
on the other side that's
one
two three my next color which is that
peach color that I have single double
and I'm going to come down
twice we're going to use the whole
Loom repeat on the other side single
double there finish the rest with our
yellow at the bottom of our pie sign
single
double we're coming
here so that's the fourth from the
bottom to the
third now from the third to the second
and then we're going to close it off
from the second to the center last Peg
and repeat on the other side same
thing single double
single double last one we are ready to
add the center of
our um pie sign let's go ahead
and get it from where your holding
instrument is and at the very bottom the
other side of where your hook is we're
going to go ahead and go in the very
bottom where the cap band was and there
should be four uh rubber bands cuz we
capped it off four times it should be
four so get you hook through all the
four Loops there stretch it out and pull
it over that last Peg there at the very
very bottom and then we're using that as
a c band push your other rubber bands
down go under your cat band grab the top
two
bands and wherever it goes Loop it onto
itself creating
teardrops and then go back in grab the
last two bands in there and looping it
onto itself and now we're going up
looping it
up twice on each side creating teardrops
as you
go that's our second
Loop and let's go on the other
side let's go ahead and add the side
piece signs this one and this one to
this Peg here so that's the two for the
fifth Peg from the bottom what we want
to do first it's so we don't have to
stretch it so much we are going to take
some of the bottom of our pie sign off
of our
Loom be careful not to take it all the
way off we're just carefully taking it
off to the fourth Peg there where we
looped up so now that you're here and
our pie sign is not too stretched out
let's go ahead and go in one of the arm
I'm working on the right one here and
I'm going in the cat band put put my
hook in again I want to find four rubber
bands that was the cat band and I'm
putting it on the fifth Peg from the
bottom like that so that's 2 four five
and I'm going to repeat on the left hand
side same thing put my hook all all the
way through those cat bands and I want
to make sure I have four rubber bands
onto my hook and then pull it
open and then hook it right onto the
fifth Peg on the left
side make sure you get all your rubber
bands on there and now let's go ahead
and loop up go under the bands here at
the bottom grabbing the bottom too and
looping it onto itself creating tear
drop
and let's go ahead and continue up this
side either side if you want we're just
going to Loop up all the way to the this
first Peg here and loop any side you
want I'm doing my right
first all the way
up make sure you grab the bottom two
bands creating
teardrops
and if your rubber band's too tight you
want to make sure you stretch it out
first so here I'm stopping with the
first side Peg there and we go ahead and
go on the other
side grabbing the bottom two
bands and looping it onto
itself again if you can't see
it push it
down grab the bottom Tu band creating
teardrop
and coming all the way
up okay now that you've done that let's
go ahead and check to make sure you have
tear te drops and the Teardrops are
catching let's go ahead and release some
of our band so we can attach this top of
our pie sign to the top of the Loom just
take your hook preferably the back so it
doesn't stick and break your bands and
we'll take most of this off the
loom moving up our
Loom
don't break your band we're almost
done now that we're here and don't twist
your sign let's go ahead and take the
last the tippy top here of our P sign
let's not twist it try to keep it
straight and put that last four rubber
band that's on that
hook that's been attached all along and
attach it to the very tippy top of our
pie sign there and the top of our Loom
go ahead and reach in grabbing the
bottom two
bands and looping it onto itself on
either
side there we are
done except for our slip knot rubber
band take a single band if you want to
that's fine go all the way through where
the arrow
is and create your slip
knot go ahead and take it
off the
loom now when it comes off the Lun it's
not going to look perfect you'll have to
adjust it a little bit pull it
out and adjust your side
your rubber bands will be
somewhat sticky but if you stretch it
out enough it'll
be
circular so there's your PE sign I hope
you like it thanks for watching
