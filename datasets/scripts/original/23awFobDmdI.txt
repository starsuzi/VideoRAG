this is going to be a video on fixing
your windows that won't go up on this
mustang actually this will work on
pretty much any car and I've got all
kinds of cars for sale definitely check
out my website 1ownercarguy.com over 150
Classics you name it even some new stuff
like this okay so let's say you've got a
problem like this and you can't get one
of your windows up for me it's this back
window
it's really really a pain in the butt
when this window won't go up and you
have no way of getting it up
um first you got to kind of know if it's
a motor or a
switch dah on a Mustang like this it's a
little hard to know if it's a
motor because it's all behind this
especially on the
convertible I think you basically have
to take the seat out to get this panel
off um
checking the switch is an easier deal
this one had a a broken tab on it which
made it real easy but to check the
switch here's your switches then you
turn them on
and every other one on the car works
except for this one so motor or
switch um to replace the switch it's
really simple um you remove these two
screws replace the switch pull this off
this piece will be on the top of this
piece yank them apart boom buy a new
Switch eBay 28 bucks for a used one you
got it I think it's like 50 75 for a new
one um so switch that's how you do the
switch now the switch is easy to
replace get your window up like I said
um without being able to have and use
your switch um I've seen people do
videos where they pull them up well
that's neat if you're Reg regulator's
unhooked or busted or whatever and you
you can pull it up if you've got a deal
like this where the windows all the way
down and you have no way of grabbing it
and even if you do it it ain't going to
come up you've got to get to the motor
you've got to get to that part at least
to the
window and and these have a little piece
on them like this they come off really
simply you just kind of pull them out of
there
like
so and to put them back in it's
rather simple as
well so that's that so that's what we
took off over here now I've got
everything I need to do
this out and over here um you're going
to need jumper cables two
wires and and hopefully you have one of
these door panel removal tools um and
I'll give you a hint here one of these
wires I don't know what gauge it is 16
18 gauge or something is not enough to
do this a guy
needs both of these tied together
actually is what I had to
use uh no problem I got
that make sure they're
separate now on this type of a deal
hopefully you have one of the these door
panel um door pin whatever you want to
call it removal tools they all have
these on the back it's very easy if you
have this just to stick it on the back
and yank it off once you get this little
plastic piece
off what you're going to want to do from
there is Yank on that piece just pull it
out and yank that out now you got this
out um pretty easy to tell on these
which come from the motor and which
which come from the other this has got a
straight red and a yellow wire on it
that's going to be to the motor this has
got a stripy
red and a stripey black black stripe on
red black stripe on yellow this is
coming from the switch um and you can
verify that by looking at the wire
colors here and the ones going to the
window that it coincides with in other
words if you looked up the other window
it' be the colors that go to that switch
but since it's this window it's the
colors that go here makes sense I hope
um so this one's our window motor one
we're going to go ahead
and turn the car
on and take the other end of the jumper
cables here now I'm not going to
get be careful if you don't know what
you're doing you could actually hook the
black up to the positive and the red up
to the negative you could hook the red
red to the negative and the black to the
positive which is what I was really
trying to say there it don't really
matter get yourself a good hookup
these motors are reverse polarity and
so it doesn't really matter which way
you do it it's just going to make the
motor work a different
way this is a Google Glass video I
normally wouldn't do these um but I'm
here and all that okay our car is
on switch is here pull it aside now
you'll notice two little diodes in there
just kind of touch one each
one get out of the way cuz if your
motor's good this is going to
work
okay that must be
down okay we've got no connection here
somehow keys
on my wires
are
a
little
crappy now that's going to
it shouldn't be a problem
now hopefully my battery is not dead
that's a
possibility
okay I think that's down I got to spark
that time and this should be
up don't hold them on there for a long
time as you see you can get a spark and
it'll weld itself right to it but touch
one and then the other balls of steel
here I'm going back down so that does it
just one wire from each lead don't
matter which is which hook that sucker
up run it
Direct
that's it windows up nice and done
that's the deal don't let these wires
touch get them unhooked as fast as you
can now I'm cheap and I reuse these
wires for buffers I burn out and stuff
because it comes in handy for stuff like
this to have a nice insulated wire uh
but that's how you get
your car window up and I've got
thousands of videos on here make sure
and check them out how-tos and car
reviews and anything that you wants to
see this was a new car trade in it's a
six-cylinder Mustang it's clean as can
be it's got about 120 on it it's for
sale um I am not going to replace the
switch in fact I took this piece off to
try
and start into that
panel need these you just line up your
pigs they have a square piece up top and
a round piece down below so make sure
and line them up
directly you can kind of tell by how
this thing fits on here you know get it
at the seam and then start at one end or
the other
and do it to it I'm going to replace
this piece in the
back I do not
think that I'm going to hook this window
back
up I think I'm going to leave
it for
now just put the cover back
on same thing here just that one's
missing a top piece and the top piece is
very um plone to breaking off on these I
worked on lots of these
Mustangs they're popular cars um I'm
personally not a fan lots of people are
that's all there is to say about it they
sell okay that's the
deal get this thing cleaned up in vacuum
now man there's not a lot of room
in the back seat of I mean I can fit
back here and they got a lot of leg room
so they'd have to move up but God
dang okay well thanks for watching
one-owner car guy.com that is a video of
how look at the back seat of this thing
just beautiful there'll be pictures on
my website 1ownercar guy.com
everything's close up smooth bam just
like that we got our window medal
fixed and it's time to start washing
detailing and stuff like that I'm going

that I absolutely hate that I don't
