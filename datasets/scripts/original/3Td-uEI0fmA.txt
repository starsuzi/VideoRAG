Welcome to The Rusted Garden today I'm
going to show you how to plant tomatoes
and peppers in seed trays the first
thing you need to do is go to your local
store and pick up seed starting
mix when you purchase it and open it up
dump it into a container it's going to
be very dry usually it doesn't have any
moisture in it I've already added some
water to
this but essentially you want to put in
about a quart of water for the bag size
that you just saw
and then just roll the starting mix
through the
water it's a lot
easier to water your sea trays from the
bottom once the soil once the gardening
uh starting mix is absorbed
water after you mix the water in you're
going to get a 9 cell sea tray or
container just like this fill it with
the starting mix the one thing that's
really important is to make sure you
press down the starting mix to make sure
that it gives uh gets good contact to
the bottom this is where the water's
going to be absorbed in to maintain your
your
seedling add some more starting
mix and this is ready for
planting
you can get seeds from your local store
they'll come in packs like this you can
order them online they'll be
sent in a you know can a yeah in a seed
pack that looks similar to that or you
can Harvest your own Tomatoes which I
did and then you need to store them in a
container it's very easy to plant I
recommend you put two seeds per cell
these are peppers
put one in each
corner and the reason I suggest doing
two is in case one doesn't germinate
you're not waiting
around for it to come up you can always
pinch
off the weakest plant and just let one
grow in there you can also gently divide
them up and then transplant them into to
cups or containers like
this the Tomatoes I actually use these
the
tomatoes get planted the same
way put two in each
cell that one had three it's all
right
and
once you put them in use a popsicle
stick I recommend you get a box of a
thousand of these or something like that
you can go to your craft store they're
very inexpensive the box of a th000 cost
me maybe
$10 take the pepper seed press it down
about a/4 of an
inch same with the
tomatoes
once they're in place you
can grab a little starting
mix cover it
over that's all you need to do to start
pepper and tomato
seeds once they're done you're going to
go into a cell flat like this you drop
it
in hopefully you have eight you're
growing a lot of different
vegetables to water these
plants the best way to do it is from the
bottom fill it
up with
water set the cell
in let it absorb water from the
bottom after about a half an hour
whatever doesn't get absorbed you can
just pour out the reason you want to
water from the bottom is one it's
convenient it'll save you a lot of time
and if you water from the the top
there's a good risk that you're going to
Splash the soil out you're going to
Splash the seeds out and you also create
an environment for
disease um and the main diseases are
damping off disease and that's when the
seedling comes up it kind of gets furry
and then it
dies here's a tray that I
started back on March 28th these are
tomatoes today is April 7th Tomatoes
take anywhere from 5 to 10 days to come
up based on how warm it is peppers can
take I don't know a week to 14 days you
can see peppers are coming up here so
they are a little bit more uh slower to
germinate so these guys are about 10
days
old here are some Tomatoes I started
back
on let's
see about March 7th so these are 30 days
old
seed starting is a really effective way
to grow tomatoes and peppers that you
can't find in stores the store uh
peppers and tomatoes can cost you
anywhere from3 4 $5 there's really no
need to do that this is an easy way to
start vegetables indoors again you can
put a flat like this by a southern
window you could use a grow closet but
this is easy effective and you will be
successful if you give it a
try if if you found this information
