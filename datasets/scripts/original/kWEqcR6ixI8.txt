welcome back I was going to share with
you how to clean baby toys and
children's toys the best soap I have
found to do this with is honest dish
soap and basically explains on the back
about that it is safe to clean baby
bottles and toys so get the warm water
running and start filling up the sink
and you can put all your toys in
obviously only toys that don't have any
batteries or like material toys but all
the plastic ones
put like five squirts in and let it sit
for like ten minutes
and then once it's done sitting what I
would do is just rinse it off and just
dry them all off or just lay them out on
a towel to dry all right I hope that was
helpful and I bet you'll have an awesome
day today thanks so much for tuning in
