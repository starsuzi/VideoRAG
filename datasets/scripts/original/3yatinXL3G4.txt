Happy New Year everybody.
Welcome to Hilah Cooking.
Today, I'm going to
show you how to make black-eyed peas, which
are a southern tradition on New
Year's Day.
They're supposed to bring you prosperity and
good fortune.
Then
if you also eat them with greens, which are
supposed to bring you money,
then you get prosperity and money for the
New Year, which are both things
that I like.
I'm going to show you how to do prosperity
first, because
that's the more chi thing to want to acquire.
Black-eyed peas with salt
pork, coming up.
The first thing to do is get the salt pork.
Salt pork is basically extra-
fatty and extra-salty bacon.
You could totally just use bacon.
Let's do
this old-school style.
I'm going to cut up a couple of ounces, maybe
1/4 -
pound of salt pork, and start frying that
in my little pot.
I'll drop this
in and I'll let it fry up pretty . . . oh,
hell.
Fine.
I'm going to let it
fry up until it's crispy, and then drop the
black eyed peas in.
This is a
recipe for frozen black eyed peas, which . . . I
don't know, whatever.
They're faster, which is basically why I'm
doing that for the sake of time.
You can use dried ones; you just need to probably
double the amount of
water, and they take maybe double the time;
but either way.
I bet the smoke
alarm's totally going to go off.
If you wanted to use bacon, you could just
use maybe a half-pound of bacon
cut up about this size.
I'll let these little fat nuggets render down
a
little bit more, and then put in my peas.
I got some tomatoes, jalapenos,
and some water also.
Let that chillax.
I'm just going to slice the
jalapenos because I think it looks pretty
when there's rings of green
throughout, but you can dice them or you can
use some other pepper.
Ya'll
know I like it spicy, so that's how I do.
Those are looking fine.
I'm going to add the vegetable stuff, matters.
We got a goodly amount of
pork fat rendering here, so there's that,
and about a cup of fresh diced
tomato.
I just want to get everything pork-fatted
up, and then I'm going to
add some water to cover it; maybe a couple
of cups of water.
We'll see.
I'm
not going to add any salt because the salt
pork is pretty salty.
We're just
taste it at the end and see what's happening
there.
Some water; perfect.
I'm going to turn it up and bring it to a
boil, and then simmer it for
maybe 30-45 minutes.
It's boiling.
I just gave it a stir, and I'm going to
turn it to simmer.
I'll see you in 30 minutes, or 45.
I'm going to do the
clock that goes . . .
It's been 45 minutes.
I'm going to turn these off, give these a
little
stir.
They totally smell amazing.
I'll put some in this bowl for me to eat.
Just kidding.
Dude, black-eyed peas are so good, you should
not just have
them on New Year's Day, even though I hope
that you do.
I will put the
recipe on the website.
May you have a prosperous New Year.
Bye.
