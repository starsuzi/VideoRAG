hi everyone this is Caroline I am going
to make my son a chore chart to hang in
the kitchen I've decided I'm going to
use a chalkboard that I purchased at
Hobby Lobby um this one is the
imagination station chalkboard 17 x23 it
was
$77.99 and I used my 40% off
coupon it came with the brackets to
mount on the back and I guess that's an
eraser um and this is just the wood so
what I'm fixing to do and I'll show you
is I'm going to apply some painters tape
around this so I don't get it on there
and then I'm going to take my little
sponge Dober and I'm going to take um
some
orange I think it's wild honey or
something like that from the distress in
from Tim Holtz so I'll show you and then
I'm going to add vinyl to it and all
that so I'm going to show you this I've
never done it so I'm hoping it works cuz
I want to hang it and so we can keep up
with Logan chores better than we do now
so let's see how this
works all righty I'm hoping this doesn't
pull up
my my chalkboard but we'll see I'm just
using the blue painters tape um I have
this on stock from on hand from painting
my house
so all I'm going to do do is go
around the edge really well um and make
sure that I don't have any
marks of chalkboard
showing so that it doesn't accidentally
get stained paint whatever I'm going to
use I don't know what I'm going to use
yet on it yeah I'll show you I don't
know if I'm going to use this orange
folk art paint
in the
color pure orange or if I'm going to use
this distress St from Tim Holtz and the
wild honey I'm going to flip this over
and see my kitchen is done in the coffee
theme and um one of the colors one of
the accent colors that I use a lot is
like the burnt looking orange kind of
like the maybe the Terracotta I might
say um so I just want to I think I want
to stain this orange because our walls
are a what color our walls like a these
no a beige maybe tan beig like a tan
color so this would make it pop really
well where I'm going to hang it I'm
going to hang it in the kitchen right by
the laundry room so that I can see it
every day and Logan can see it to
remember so um let me finish taping this
up and then I'll flip it over and I
think I'm almost positive I'm going to
use this this but I want to see what it
looks like before I do the whole thing
in it so flip it over and just stain it
right here on the back just to see what
it's going to do this is just a
SpongeBob Dober that I get from
scrapbooks decom
um and you can use the the Dober from on
the
thing but I'm not going
to what do you think will I kind of like
that matches our kitchen accent curtains
and stuff so I'm going to flip it back
[Music]
over I don't know if I like
that I'm going to flip it
I'm going to flip it back over and see
what it looks like with orange paint
okay now that I've done that I don't
know if I like it so I'm going
to and I probably don't have enough of
this paint to this is some thick paint
let's
see so I think I'm going to change
it and because I'm not liking the way
it's turning out that color so told you
this is trial and error I'm going to
take this
and
actually go over it with a
paintbrush and I'm just going to paint
it so it's going to take me a
while but that's okay I want it to look
good because it's going to be in my
kitchen I'm
not I'm not going to hide it so I want
it to turn out good so I'm going to go
ahead and finish painting it and then
I'll come back and show you
guys what it looks like when it's all
painted and um I'll show
[Music]
you how we're going
to
hopefully cut the image out so all right
what I'm going to do is just open up my
Silhouette studio um I'm going to go
into my library because I already own
this item and here it is it says chore
chart all right
did I already click
it I think I have two now yeah let me
delete one of those all right so here it
is now what she recommends doing what
she recommends doing is um chopping it
up into quarters um whoa wrong butt she
recommends chopping it up into quarters
so that you can put it on a bigger um
surface like I'm going to be
doing um
I
don't I don't think I want to do that so
what I'm going to do is ungroup it first
and I'm going to
delete that okay and then I'm going to
make sure I group that back together and
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go up here to the top and I'm going
to resize it now my width I'm going to
want
it oh my shirt sticking to my
I think that's 15 and a half I'm GNA do
something first this is how I do all of
my stuff can you please pull that door
shut for a
minute I'm G to make a box and I'm going
to go ahead and make the box like my
um my what do you call it my chalkboard
I'm working on because this will give me
show me what it's going to look like on
my chalkboard and then I'm going to say
21 and a
half and this is how it's going to to
make my chalkboard now I'm going to have
to shrink this because I can't see it
you know to work all right and then what
I'm going to do is take my
chalkboard thing
here I'm going to stretch it
out now I don't want it quite the size
of my chalkboard I kind of want to leave
a little perimeter around
it and I don't know if I want it full
let's
see no that's too big so I think I want
it
like I think I want it about like
that I wonder if I could put both kids
on
here let's see command see I'm gonna
copy it and I'm gonna command V it
because I have a um a
Macbook so I'm going to shrink this
let's
see
okay now we're going to delete that I
know I do things
backwards that's just how my brain works
ah if you guys know me you know
that I think it would be awesome though
to do both kids chores on here because
both of my kids have chores all right
now I do want to stretch that out a
little bit not much let's see I like
that better so let's still delete this
bottom one and let's do this one one
more time so I know it's exactly the
same
size okay
and Bam
now I don't know if I want it quite that
big let's
see I wonder if I do the width at a 12
let's just
see no I don't like
that all right so now what I'm going to
do
is I make everything in my life so
difficult we're going to cut this bad
boy well hang on I'm G to move this out
of the way now because I don't need that
let's just go ahead and delete it I'm
gonna take my scissor my knife and I'm
going to let's see I don't know where 12
is let's just cut
it I don't know how I going to do this I
probably should have done it like she
said and did it in quarters but I don't
think I can match it up that way so I
think I'm gonna
go bam like
that and then I'm waiting on it there it
goes and then
see
booah you have separate pieces and then
all you got to do is line that up
because I don't think that's 12 in no
that's uh 11.4 75 so I'm good so I'm
going to do is get out my white vinyl
after I turn my machine on I'm going to
get out my white vinyl and I'm going to
cut that out of my white vinyl my vinyl
is
permanent
um after I break everything in sight
here y'all hear me I'm just crashing
everything in here I'm going to
um I'm going to attach my
vinyl then I'm GNA cut it out I'm only
going to cut
out um one at a time let's
see and
right don't you'all like my sound side
effects sound effects side effects yeah
I'm out in la la land half the days okay
we're just going to have to cut out one
at a time um I'm going to blow that back
up so that I can see because I like to
get the most use out of
my machine hang on a
minute all right so that's what I'm
going to do that's a pretty that is so
pretty okay watch out please Mommy's
doing something we need to
move um I'm going to go ahead and cut
one piece out at a time and then I'm
going to connect them together on my uh
paper before I stick them down that way
they line up perfect so I'm going to go
ahead and cut this out
um let me see I don't know what I'm
doing all right I'm going cut I'm
cutting out with
vinyl I'm GNA lower the speed of hair
because it is going to have to cut out
lines so I'm gonna go ahead and
cut I'm gonna go ahead and cut this
and we'll see what it
does so I'm gonna cut the whole thing
out and then I'll show you how I put it
together and all that okay you can't
probably really see it because it's
there let me see if I can zoom in some
there you go I went ahead and painted
the whole thing I painted the top the
side and then the inside part I did not
paint the very back of it because that's
going to be stuck to the wall and I
don't think I'm going to use these
hangers I'm going to
I I touch it I'm going to see how heavy
it is um I don't think it's really that
heavy cuz I've been holding it with one
hand while I painted all around it and
if it's not too heavy I'm going to
attach command strips to the uh you know
each piece and hang it that way because
I love command strips and they don't
tear up my wall and I don't have holes
all in my wall so um and you can't see
them so I'm going to do that but I'm
going to let it dry completely I don't
think it has I think the top of it
already dry um but I'm going to let it
dry a few minutes longer I'm going to go
ahead and pull off
this let's see what it does I'm really
hoping it doesn't pull up my
[Music]
chalkboard and I didn't
do I didn't do too bad of a job painting
it right that
now I mean I see some spots I missed in
some spots that um I hit the chalkboard
with but I don't see nothing
that I could you know write home about
all right now what I did um if you if
you skipped ahead because you don't use
a silhouette or whatever I cut out I'm
cutting it out you hear it in the
background um some vinyl and I'm going
to put a chore chart up here and a chore
chart down here I'm going to do Logan's
and Leah's because both of my kids do
chores okay now this is going to be a
little difficult to show you because
it's all white and am using white white
but I need to pull out all the parts
that I'm not going to use so and then
what's really bad is when you pull it
out you're still on white so it's hard
to show you um I'm just going to pull
out the boxes and stuff because I just
want the
lines that it
shows if that makes
sense so I'm just going to go ahead and
do this because you can't you can't see
it because it's like I said it's white
on white so I don't think you can see
that let me show you but this is what
I'm doing if you can see it I'm pulling
out yeah you can see I'm pulling out the
boxes because I just want the lines
because I'm going to actually write you
know and let them check and stuff like
that as they do their chores for the day
so that's what I'm doing right now so
I'm going to finish doing that to all of
them and then we'll figure out from
there what I'm doing okay I don't think
you can see this again what I did was I
finished I cut out the other the half
that you saw in the video I cut and then
what it looks like I've done and I hope
it's straight is I cut so where it would
line up perfectly and then I stuck it on
my Silhouette mat so it sticks and it
looks like it's lined up perfect so that
I can take my um transfer tape and lay
it over the whole thing so I'm not
trying to piece it together on the
chalkboard because I am not that I can't
even draw a straight line with a ruler
so I'm hoping that is straight it looks
straight but that could be off but let's
see so I'm going to put some transfer
tape over this
oh got find it I've got so much junk
over here can't find nothing um I don't
use actually transfer tape if you watch
me enough you know I use contact paper
it's shelf liner that I purchased at
Walmart who it just to me it works
better not everybody thinks
so but it does to me all right so we're
going to cut it this one if you watch my
channel enough you know I use um my
scissors
thing started half the
time what I'm going to do is put this
one on the bottom so I
don't get it there and it's sticky so
all right then I'm going to take this
one and pray really hard this works and
I might do a voice over so you don't
hear some of the stuff that I say I'll
say crap a
lot yeah I'm all up in this shot
sorry it's like this thing
just
just see if that's
you can somewhat see where it's
also been pieced
together and I just ripped a piece
that's always just downright wonderful
now I'm going to go back on back onto my
Silhouette and I'm going to figure out
how to write Logan's chores and Leah's
chores and then I'm going to write suay
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
Saturday and then their chores right
there and then all I have to do is use
the chalk or whatever to mark off the
days of the week so I'm going to try
that I'm not going to show you I will
show you that in the video cuz I know
I'll get questions if not so I'm going
to show you in the
video all righty I'm back to show you
how I'm going to add the days and stuff
on here and the
um what do you call it the uh the
name um I'm I'm looking at my board to
see how I want to do this
it's already the size that I'm I'm going
to use it at so I'm going to go over
here to the
alphabet and I'm going to type
in Logan's
chores doie and then I'm G to change
that font because I'm not feeling that I
really like the marker font let's see
what that looks
like and then we're going to make it
bigger
put
Sunday I'm gonna I'm gonna blow this up
so I can see it better I'm going put
whoa all right I want that S I want it
smaller like a lot
smaller like crazy small
and I'm going to put that
in I'm going to make that the marker
font as
well um
okay yeah okay go go go lay
down all right it's going to be really
small but that's okay and I'm going to
blow it up some more because even though
it looks like it's not
touching for you it will be
see and I want to shrink all right so
there's Sunday so I'm going to do
that all the way through and now I'm
going to shrink
that there we go now that's going to be
really hard to cut out but we'll get it
all right there's Logan's
chores so I'm going to make sure it cuts
out first with Leah's before I try to
cut it I mean with Logan before I try to
cut it again um and I think what I want
to
do
is go ahead and write his chores as well
of his chores is make his bed he has to
make his make his
bed which is funny because I don't make
mine and I know I should but I hate
making my bed I don't see the point in
making it if you're gonna get back in
it so that's how that's how you do it um
I'm going to go ahead and do
Leah's you know the same way and cut it
all out and weed it and then I'll show
you how you know I put it on the actual
board so that's how I do that so yep
okay I forgot I was filming this video
and I got Logan's done I only
changed um I think this one I had brush
teeth but I changed it to shower and
teeth because he can you know take his
own shower now so I'm going to do Leah's
and I went ahead and cut all hers out so
I'm just going to attach hers like I did
his the finished product I'm going to
move it so you can actually see
it and here it is finished it says
Logan's charg and then it says Sunday
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
Saturday make bed feed pets pick up toys
unload silverware gather laundry shower

job is to unload the silverware from the
dishwasher after I wash
