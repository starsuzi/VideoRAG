hi guys and welcome back to the cocktail
vlog so yet again it's been a little
while the last week has been really hot
and I'm gonna get back into the swing of
things things it has been a while I'm
gonna get started on a really simple
drink the fuzzy navel this was first
made by Ray Foley over 30-plus years ago
it was the founder of the bartender
magazine gotta be real short sharp and
shiny video and it's pretty much just
two ingredients you can build this
cocktail but I'm gonna shake it and make
the children turn right down
it's just peach the cure or peach snaps
and orange juice so 45 bills shot half
of peach snaps oh that's ready to shaker
followed by 120 mils of orange juice
and then peel you shake with us then
give it a good shake
so grab your Hawthorne strainer and
strain over fresh ice okay if you prefer
you can just build this drink make it
even quicker but as you can see that
didn't take very long at all but it's
going to add a little bit of texture to
the drink okay now you can serve it up
like that or you can garnish with an
orange wheel if you substitute the peach
schnapps or if you lower it just a
little bit and add some vodka into it
and it comes a hearing able but they
have the fuzzy navel Cheers
super simple it's nice it's refreshing
