- [Narrator] Hi guys, and
welcome to The Family Fudge.
Today I'm going to share
with you, four very easy
and tasty recipes that you can make
in your waffle iron, so stay tuned.
(upbeat music)
Now there are so many different foods
that you can actually cook
in a waffle iron other than waffles.
Today I'm gonna share
with you a breakfast idea,
two ideas that would work
for either lunch or dinner,
and then a dessert.
I hope you like this video.
I hope that you'll give
it a big thumbs up,
and that you will subscribe,
if you're not already.
Let's go ahead and jump right in.
(swooshing)
I'm kicking things off
with my breakfast option.
Today I'm making these
churro french toast sticks.
I call them churro french toast sticks,
because I'm going to be using
some cinnamon and sugar.
They are super delicious.
I'm going to start by cracking
three eggs into a dish.
To this I'm going to add
about a half a cup of milk,
just a tiny bit of sugar, not too much
'cause it is going on the outside as well,
and then I'm going to whisk it up.
Now, if you want to get fancy,
you can also add some vanilla flavoring,
a little bit of salt and
a little bit of cinnamon.
Then I just whisk this up again.
(upbeat music)
Next I'm going to prepare my
cinnamon and sugar mixture,
so it's ready to go.
I'm going to add about two parts of sugar
to one part cinnamon.
Then just mix it up.
(upbeat music)
One very important detail when
you're using your waffle iron
to cook other foods, is
to spray it really well
with non-stick spray.
This waffle iron I'm
using today is actually
my husband's grandmother's.
It is older than I am, but
it still works really well.
I'm gonna start by dipping
my bread very quickly
into the egg mixture.
I don't want my bread to get too soggy.
Then I'm just gonna
cook it until it's done.
Next I'm going to remove
it, and very quickly dip it
in my cinnamon sugar mixture,
making it like a churro.
Then I'm going to cut it into sticks.
This is definitely one of
my kids' favorite treats.
I'm also gonna serve this
with some fresh strawberries
and a little bit of maple syrup to dip in.
Now before I give this
a try, I definitely want
to remember to take a
picture for my fun mail.

With the cinnamon and sugar,
these smell like churros for sure.
You guys, these make excellent
freezer breakfast as well.
Make a big bath, stick
them in the freezer,
and reheat them in the toast.
(swooshing)
Next up, I'm making my barbecue
ranch chicken queso waffles.
I know that sounds really funny,
but this is a very easy
and tasty lunch or dinner.
I'm going to start by adding some
of my favorite barbecue
sauce to some chicken meat.
Now this chicken meat is left over
from our rotisserie chicken.
It's the perfect way to use it up.
Oh yes, and I also added a little bit
of my homemade ranch, then I mixed it up.
I have a separate video on
how I make my homemade ranch,
if you'd like to check it out.
I will link it down below.
(upbeat music)
Now of course you
definitely want to remember
to spray your waffle iron
so this doesn't stick,
but basically I'm going
to put down one tortilla,
and then I'm going to add a little bit
of shredded mozzarella
cheese, followed by some
of my chicken, and then some
shredded cheddar cheese.
I also like to throw in
a handful of spinach.
Totally optional, you can
leave it out if you'd like.
I'm gonna top this with one more tortilla,
and cook until it is warm through
and the cheese is bubbly and delicious.
(upbeat music)
Then I'm going to very carefully
remove it with some tongs
and a spatula, and slice it up.
(upbeat music)
I'd like to serve this with
extra ranch for dipping,
and some carrots.
Would you look at all that cheese!
(upbeat music)
(swooshing)
Next up are my cheesy corn dog waffles.
I'm starting with one box of
this Jiffy Corn Bread mix.
I like to get all the lumps out of there.
To this I'm going to add one
egg, half a cup of sour cream,
two tablespoons of melted butter,
and half a cup of shredded cheddar cheese.
Then I'm going to mix it up.
Next I'm going to take several hotdogs,
and I'm going to cut them in quarters.
(upbeat music)
I'm gonna add one bamboo
skewer to each piece of hotdog.
Next I'm going to scoop
a little bit of my batter
onto my waffle iron.
(upbeat music)
Next I'm going to add my hotdogs.
About eight are going to
fit in here at one time.
Then I'm going to cover
these with more of the batter
and cook until golden brown.
Once these are done, I'm
going to remove them,
and slice them up.
I like to serve this with
some ketchup and mustard,
and some tomatoes.
(clicking of camera)
These are perfect for dipping
and the kids love them.
(upbeat music)
(swooshing)
Last up I'm making a dessert.
These are going to be brookies,
which is combination of
a brownie and a cookie,
of course cooked in the waffle iron.
I'm gonna start by
preparing the brownie batter
according to the directions on the box.
(upbeat music)
A little bit of water,
a little bit of butter,
one egg, and that is it.
I'm going to stir it up.
I'm gonna set that aside,
and prepare my cookie dough.
I'm gonna add my dry ingredients
with the chocolate chips,
a little bit of water,
a little bit of melted
butter, and that is it.
I'm going to stir it up.
Next I'm going to drop a
little bit of my brownie batter
and a little bit of my cookie
dough into the waffle iron.
These are going to cook super fast.
Just a few minutes.
Now I have to be honest with you,
it was kind of difficult removing these
from my waffle iron, but we got them out,
and they tasted delicious.
To serve these I like to add a little bit
of vanilla ice cream, but I
left my vanilla ice cream out
and it got all melted, but that's okay.
I'm just gonna put it on top,
add a few mini chocolate
chips, and we can dig in.
It's definitely a lot faster
than cooking brownies in the oven.
