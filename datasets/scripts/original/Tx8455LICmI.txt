I'm going to show you how to do Hoppers
today to start this recipe I have
3 75 G of rice flour I'm going to add
that into
the
bowl I have 7 G of yeast and 3 tbspoon
of sugar with a little bit of warm
water I put that little white go to
activate the
yeast
salt salt always to your
taste then I'm going to add the yeast
into the rice
flour you can make this with water and
leave it
like a little dough and after that you
can add the coconut milk I'm going to
add coconut milk directly into the rice
flour because I'm going to do this
quickly so add the coconut milk into the
rice
flour to get the right
consistency it's just like
pancakes so I think I need
another can of coconut
milk if
you now I'm going to add another coconut
milk and make sure
you keep on mixing and um get the right
consistency don't add the second one at
once make sure you mix it
properly and get the
consistency like
pancakes when I was opening this
actually the top broke down
I think it's all right now so I am going
to leave this in a warm place about 20
minutes and I'll show you how to do The
Hoppers I left my Hopper pan on the
stove to be hot and I'm going
to add one spoon
full and turn it around if you are using
a non-stick pan you don't need to oil
the pan if not you need to oil the
pan and cook it on low
heat cover it and cook it on low heat
about 2 3
minutes now the Hopper is ready so
actually I don't need to take it out
it's coming out because it's a non-stick
pan put it onto a
plate and this is a plain Hopper and I'm
going to show you how to do an egg
Hopper
now to do
that just like what we did before take
one spoon P Off full of the mixture and
pour it in
turn it
around now add one egg into
the hopper mix and leave it if you want
to add salt or pepper feel free to add
salt and pepper on top of that if you
don't want that leave it like this I'm
going to add a little bit of
salt and cover this and slow cook this
for about 2 3
minutes I hope you will enjoy making
Hoppers like this thank you for watching
