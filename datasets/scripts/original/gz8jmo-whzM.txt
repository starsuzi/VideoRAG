hello and welcome to do yourself ideas
today i've got a slightly different idea
for you for loom bands
especially if you've got some less
pretty elastics like these
they sometimes come in these big boxes
with all the other elastics so this is
really perfect for that
this is a bouncy ball that actually
bounces
sadly i can't show it to you since it
might knock over my camera happens all
the time
this is super easy and always fun
so you first need a sheet of paper
which you make into a nice little ball
and then you simply start wrapping your
loom bands around it
i'll take the uglier ones first so you
won't see them later
continue doing this
it holds on its own really well so you
don't need to worry about anything
slipping away
you can also take two at a time to make
things quicker
already looks pretty round
i continue doing this until i've almost
reached the size i want
then afterwards i start taking the
prettier elastics that i can see on the
outside
you'll realize at one point that you'll
have to just wrap them around once
instead of twice
it's hard to say how many elastics
exactly you'll need just make it as big
or small as you like
there's also
there's also world records and how many
elastics you can make a ball out of
in a moment i'll tell you how to
continue when the ball is big
here
of course i wrapped them around
only once now
try to get them nice in the middle
again they really hold on their own
just continue doing this
so
so
do
do
