you are
[Music]
you you are
everybody this is Beverly with Beverly's
design time and welcome
back as you've seen in my previous video
I asked about different candle holders
that I had made and this is one of the
popular ones that everybody wanted to
see made so um tonight I'm going to go
ahead and show you how to make this
we're going to start out with this bowl
that I made in a previous video I'll
leave a link below to show you how to
make this here I I have a regular candle
holder that I purchased from Dollar Tree
and I just spr painted it with some
stained glass paint and if you need to
see how that's done I'll leave a link
for it
below next we'll need is dollar tree
ornaments so you guys might have to wait
for Christmas to come around or you can
check Goodwill and see if you can find
some of these um I actually did find
some at Goodwill but they were like too
glued together but so always check the
Christmas aisle and this one has this
loop on it and this is where the string
was attached just cut that
off and it's warm but that's okay
because we're going to cover all that up
so the first thing I want to do is just
glue this to the base and I'm going to
use some
E6000 and be generous with it you want
to make sure you have a good contact
and if you're worried about the stained
glass paint it won't interfere with the
um gluing of the two so now all that I'm
going to do is just set this
here press it
down and then I'm going to add a weight
to this and you guys know I always like
to use my crystal ball now if you have
to stand up and make sure it's e even
then do
that and now I'm breaking out the
biggest crystal ball that I have to hold
this it kind of sinks in the middle so I
really want to make sure I get that
weight down so I'll just set this
here and let that weight glue those two
pieces
together and once they are glued
together I'll come back and finish this
DIY hi guys I'm back and it has been
about 12 hours and since then I have
managed to cut myself here here but I'm
okay so let's just go on to the next
step I am going to remove my crystal
ball and this is glued on I'm not going
to force it because it has only been 12
hours so so now we'll take our bowl and
glue it on top of here and you'll notice
these parts here are raised and this is
where it's going to make contact with
the vase and I'm not going to paint the
bottom because it's really really not
necessary to put my glue on the raised
[Music]
Parts really generous like
before okay so just put your face on top
your
bow and if you need to lift it up and
look around make sure it looks even
and just look around and if you see
places where there's too much glue just
push it
back just go around it a couple of
times and make sure you clear up all the
unnecessary glue
press
down if it looks like you need to shift
it then slide
it you can also get a level and check
it and see if you need to shift
it so what I'll do now just go ahead and
add some weight to make sure the top
part glues to the middle part and I
guess I use some of these glass gems
[Music]
so now I'll wait 24 hours and let this
dry completely and then I'll go on to
the next steps and finish this up for
you guys hi everyone I'm back and it's
been 24 hours since I glued this onto
this base so what I want to do now is
just remove these gems
and as you can see it's glued on so you
could really stop here if you want to
it's still a really cute look you would
just have to go in and fill in some of
these um places where it's missing
glitter but I want to paint this blue so
I'm going to
use this turquoise blue that I found at
Michaels and it was less than a
dollar I'm just going to put a lid into
this
container so I'll just use a little bit
of this paint and what I'm going to do
is just paint my
ornament
[Music]
blue now I could have painted some of
this had of time but I didn't want the
paint to get in the way of me gluing the
bow onto the ornament
[Music]
okay so that's fine the reason that I
painted it blue is because I want to go
over it with some blue glitter and I
didn't want to have to use a whole lot
so and my next step is to mix some mod
pods with this blue glitter that I chose
I found this at Walmart and I think it
comes in like a pack of 12 with
different other um colors of
glitter but I'm going to let this dry
and I have some places where I need to
clean up the paint so I'm going to clean
that up and then let that dry come back
and then we'll go on to the next
step I'm back everyone and my paint is
dry I actually decided to add some paint
on the base as well so what I'm going to
to do now is just pour some Mod Podge
into this little plastic
container and add some blue
[Music]
glitter and if you've been watching my
videos you've seen me do this technique
plenty of times and I stick to it
because it works for
me to this
[Music]
I'm going to start out with a bigger
brush so I'm just going to paint on my
glitter and my podge
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay guys so this is how we are looking
so far you can still see some of the
blue paint underneath and really that's
fine I could actually stop here but I'm
going to go in for another coat this is
how we're looking at the the bottom so
you can see it definitely needs another
another
coat so I'm just going to go in again
[Music]
[Music]
okay so I'm going to paint the bottom
and if it needs a third coat then I'll
add a third coat if not I'll come back
and um add some bling to this and we'll
be
done hi everyone I'm back and
today my piece is almost done
I went ahead and put another layer of
mod podge and then sprinkled it with the
glitter but you guys didn't see that so
um I'm done with the base so now what I
want to do is just add a little bit more
bling to it so what I'm going to do is
just use some glue for my glue
gun and put this
on try not to burn myself
if you've seen the video that I did
asking if you guys want to see how I
made this candle holder you will know
that I've already made one and if you
don't pay attention to Dollar Tree you
can actually pick up two different
candle bases so the candle base that I
have on the other one is different from
this one and it really doesn't matter
because I actually painted the bow
different too when I used the Looking
Glass spray
paint on the other one I actually put
the Looking Glass spray paint on the
outside and then you know sprayed it and
then sprayed it with the vinegar and
water solution to give it the mercury
glass look and this one I put the the
Looking Glass spray paint on the inside
and you'll see I'll show you the other
one in just a second you'll see that
this one has a more more shine to it the
other one is still really pretty but I
prefer the look of this one so just let
me put that last little bead of
glue
okay so yeah that's it I'll leave links
below to the videos where you can find
how to do this showing you how to spray
your glass with the stained glass spray
paint also this is the first one that I
did and if you look closely you can see
the difference I actually sprayed this
one lighter with the blue I didn't go as
dark but um you can see the
difference so I'll be using this
technique most of the time I might use
it sometimes both the bases are
different but won't matter because I'll
make another one to match this one
exactly this one I'll probably put in my
bathroom or something I don't know but
yeah I'm going to make another one to
match this one and guys you do you do
not have to make it
blue and and if you guys remember I
painted some other bowls this is how it
looks and this is the mercury glass look
from the look and glass spray paint so
you can leave it like that that's really
pretty on its own but um I also have
some stained glass spray paint and
green but yeah these would be really
cute as a set you can make a set of five
you can make a set of six a set of two
but I think a set of four is a good
number so these would be cute actually
displayed together somewhere um it's up
to you you can use whatever colors you
want like I said the other um spray
paint that I use is called tint it so
yeah you can use tint it the only thing
with tint it it gives kind of a dough
finish so after using it you would have
to spray with a clear if you want a
really shiny finish like on
these okay guys so that's it oh yeah one
other thing I'm going to try and start
uploading a video every Monday and then
every once in a while I'll do a bonus
video on Thursday just until I can
commit myself to doing two videos a week
so guys um start looking for videos on
Monday and like I said a bonus video on

going on with me but I'll be doing

Walmart During um the holiday season

all different colors I have so many
different styles of those butterflies
