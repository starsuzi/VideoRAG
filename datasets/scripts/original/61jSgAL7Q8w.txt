- Hey, guys, it's Jessica
with Expressions Vinyl,
and today we are gonna show you
what you can layer with
heat transfer vinyl, or HTV.
We're gonna tell you what
you can and can't layer,
what holds up the best
and things like that.
Okay, so here I have all the
different layers you can do.
This turquoise layer on
the bottom is EasyWeed
and then the top layer
right here is also EasyWeed.
This whole shirt, the
bottom layer is EasyWeed,
and so this layer is the metallic.
And then we've got StripFlock,
holographic, and glitter.
Now over here, on this shirt,
the bottom gray layer is StripFlock,
and I know a lot of you are gonna say,
"StripFlock? You can't
layer on StripFlock."
But with Siser StripFlock, you can.
So I've layered EasyWeed on top,
and then we've got metallic,
and this one is StripFlock on StripFlock,
and then holographic and glitter.
So basically, those are the vinyls.
If you're gonna layer, you want either
EasyWeed, stretch or
StripFlock on the bottom,
and then you can layer
whatever you want on top.
Now with the glitters,
you don't wanna layer
glitter on top of glitter because
the glitter will affect the adhesive.
You can get it to stick,
but washing and stuff,
it's not gonna hold up as long
as it would if you layered EasyWeed
on the bottom and then glitter on the top.
The same goes for
holographic and the metallic.
You always want those
to be your top layers.
I have a shirt here that I have
layered different pieces with
So I've got EasyWeed on the bottom,
EasyWeed for her eyes and nose,
and then the holographic is
on top for the little accents.
Okay, so I'm gonna show you an example
of a project I had a lot of trouble with.
So this bottom layer,
the black, is EasyWeed,
and it's such a big solid piece
that when I laid that
on first, it shrunk up.
So you can see that these
layers here are sticking out
because my bottom layer shrunk up so much.
And then over here, I tried to pop out
the middles of the black and
then center these inside,
and if I were to do them individually,
I think I could've got it to work,
but I was doing like the blue layer,
the red layer, then the green layer,
so it's kind of tricky and
then the black shrunk up again.
So I'm gonna show you a little trick,
and we're actually gonna make this shirt,
on what you can do to
layer this many layers
and it not shrink up on you.
Okay, so I've got all my layers here.
As you can see, I have quite a few layers.
So we're gonna start.
The trick to not having your
bottom layer shrink on you
is using StripFlock.
It's got a fuzzy texture,
and you'll mirror it when you cut it out,
and then when you weed, it's
gonna leave this little fuzzy,
but that won't transfer onto your shirt
because the adhesive is on this part
and that's what's gonna
transfer to your shirt.
So I've got these all laid out.
If you notice, I have a t on each one,
and that's just to show
me that it's the top,
this section is the top.
So when I'm layering, I know kind of
where I'm at with each piece.
So the next one we will
show you how to layer it on.
Okay, now I'm gonna show you how to
kind of line up your image on your shirt.
You wanna make sure all
your tags are taken off
and you don't have
anything left on the shirt.
You can pre-shrink it if you want.
Just don't use a drier
sheet or fabric softener
because that will affect
the adhesive on your shirt.
So I like to do this trick.
I take this shirt and I fold it in half,
so it gives me a crease
right down the middle.
Get it all straightened out,
and then I press it
for just a few seconds,
just to give me that line
so I know right where the
middle of my shirt is.
Okay, and then I'm gonna
get it centered on here.
And now I've got my first layer,
which is the StripFlock, and
I'm gonna fold that in half.
And when I was creating it,
I put a box around it
so when I weeded it out,
I had nice straight lines to cut around.
And vinyl is very forgiving, so you can
fold it like that and
it's gonna press out.
So I'm gonna line up my line right here,
and my line down here,
and now this is StripFlock.
The temperature you usually wanna do it at
is 320 for 15 to 20 seconds.
Where we're layering it so much,
and this is the first layer,
I'm only gonna press this
one for five seconds.
And I've got my temperature set at 305
because the rest of my
layers are gonna be EasyWeed
and EasyWeed likes the
temperature to be at 305.
So I'm gonna press this for five seconds,
and my timer's gonna go.
Another thing about StripFlock
is it is a cold peel,
so we've gotta let this
cool off a little bit
before I peel it off.
If I were to peel it off right now,
the vinyl's gonna come up
with the transfer sheet
and you're gonna be sad.
So we're gonna let that
cool off a little bit.
Peel it off slow.
Now if I were to take this and wash it,
it would probably come up because
I didn't transfer it long enough.
But where we're gonna layer,
we're gonna get it nice
and set before we...
Aw, and I'm losing it now
Okay, so did you see that I lost an L?
I'm just gonna lay that all
back down and press it again,
just for a few seconds.
Pop it back up, let it
cool off a little bit.
And we got it to stick down, okay.
Now I've got a little cheat
sheet that I printed off
of how my layers are gonna go,
and I want this because not
all the lines are equal.
Like up here, I've got, I need
to leave a little thinner line,
and down here, it's a little thicker.
So I'm just using this as my cheat sheet
to kinda tell how far
apart my lines need to be
so we can get everything
to line up really well.
My first layer I'm gonna do is the yellow,
because it's got my corner pieces,
so that'll get me started out.
And I also have a t to
tell me where the top is.
I wanna make sure I peel that
off before I transfer down.
So I know where the top is now.
And I wanna take my time and
make sure I get this lined up.
This is the first layer.
If this layer's messed
up, the rest of it's
gonna be off a little bit.
So just check back with my cheat sheet
and make sure I've got
everything where it needs to be.
And I've got my carrier
sheet for the yellow,
but I've got some parts sticking out,
and so we are gonna get a
paper to go over top of that.
Okay, so now we have our multi-use paper
and that is gonna protect the vinyl
that we've already put on from our heat,
so it doesn't come up on our
metal and ruin our vinyl.
So we've got that covered
up and we're gonna
press this layer for like two seconds.
And this layer is EasyWeed,
so it likes the hot peel,
and again, it's not gonna be set down,
the adhesive isn't gonna be set,
so if we were to wash
this, it wouldn't stick,
but with all our other layers,
we're gonna get a full set.
So this is my next layer,
I've got my t for the top,
and I'm gonna kinda eyeball it
and see where it needs to be.
Peel off my t again cause I don't want
that part on my shirt.
And again, I'm gonna take
my time and make sure
my layers are where they need to be.
So my green is up kind of a little bit,
so I gotta make sure I get
that in the right spot.
Alright, think we are there, okay.
And my multi-use paper again
to protect the exposed,
and just press that for
two or three seconds.
And then peel that layer off.
Alright, we're gonna do blue next.
And same thing, peel off our t,
and then get this into place.
I think that's good.
Couple seconds, and pop it up.
So you could totally do this with an iron
but it would take a lot of
pressing, it would take a while.
Heat press definitely
makes layering easier.
Okay, so we've got our next
layer, the white layer,
and I've already peeled off my t.
And I'm gonna get this nice and lined up.
Okay, and then my multi-use
paper over the top.
Press it for a couple of seconds.
And voila.
Alright, we're getting close.
This is a lot of layers.
Pull off my t, do my red layer.
So it's nice to have a background
that can guide you on your layering
so you can get everything
nice and straight.
Okay, do this one for a couple seconds.
And my last layer is my orange.
So we'll get that nice and lined up,
and do our last press,
and this one, we are going
to do for ten seconds,
cause each layer only
got a couple seconds,
but our first layer, the yellow layer,
has gotten the most exposure.
But doing it for ten seconds will just
make sure everything's nice and set
and everything gets a full press.
So, we'll pop this up and pull off
our very last little
piece of carrier sheet.
And we are done, we've got all our layers
and they're nice and lined up.
