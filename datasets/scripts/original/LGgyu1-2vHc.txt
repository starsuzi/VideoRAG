hi everyone and welcome to a cooking
video um I'm going to show you how I
make liver and onions with mashed
potatoes um there's various ways people
make this um various
ingredients but I'm going to show you
the way my grandmother did it and it
just tastes absolutely
fantastic um so let's get going so the
the ingredients I'm using uh potatoes
peeled and prepared ready to boil and
they'll take about 20 OD minutes when
they're boiling you need a frying
pan you need the liver itself which this
case it's Lamb's liver only a pound um
there's only me that eats this here so
I'm going to cook all that and it'll do
two meals for me so
liver one
onion I use use two oxos Salt and Pepper
plain flour and oil just a spot of oil
to uh cook the liver okay I've just
turned the potatoes on so they're
starting to well not boil but the
they're going to start boiling just now
so what we do is we add a little bit of
oil not too
much and we'll put the heat on
wrong
[Music]
wrong just very very low now one thing I
do is I bring the liver out of the
fridge 20 minutes before I start cooking
it that's important it reaches room
temperature and another thing I found is
the heat must be mild not some people do
seal it in hot oil to seal it I don't do
it like that I do it nice and
gentle just get that
coated and
[Music]
um we'll start then to add the
liver it's a very good sauce of
iron for those that are interested in
its health benefits
some people don't like handling liver
but that's one of those things you can
use a tweezers or something like
that but it is worth it in the
end seems a lot of liver here but this
will do it'll do me two meals and I'm
not going to waste
any there you
go right so the potatoes are starting to
simmer
the liver I've just turned it over and
that's just very gently simmering so
that's lovely time to prepare the onion
so what I'm going to do is straight in
half and coarsely chop it I'm not going
to mess about so what I'll do
is probably just a very
basic minute that's it and then
and the waist in
it that's
that the same with this
one and that's as simple as that now
what we'll do now is add the uh onions
to the
liver right there's the liver and it's
starting to change color and there is
spots of blood and all that sort of
stuff but don't worry about that's
normal that's all part of it and what we
do is we just simply add the onion Chuck
it in as it
is right
and give it a bit of a stir so what you
can do now is leave that just for a few
minutes let us settle in these chunks
don't worry about
even as it is there we go so let that
simmer for a couple of
minutes right they've been cooking now
for a couple of minutes 2 3 minutes just
to let the onion are of settle in and
what I'm going to do now is sprinkle
crumble two oxos over
there in fact you don't have to add two
it's to taste
but I like um adding two oxos you could
use Gravy granules which will give you
an instant thick
gravy um you can add stock pots anything
like that but this is the way my
grandmother did it and the way I enjoyed
it so is the way I'm going to do
it right now we've done
that a secret
ingredient and this is what gives it its
flavor we're going to add now some water
from the potatoes so I'll show you we're
going to pour some of that into there
and I will re top the potato water with
um some boiled water from the kettle so
it'll carry on cooking the potatoes and
uh rice let's get
going so very gently
[Applause]
right just top that
up now as you can
see we're going to mix all this now and
let it simmer very very slowly simmer
simmer simmer and uh oh the
smell can't wait
[Applause]
so that's simmer in lovely now as you
can see look at that gravy
beautiful
and we're going to add now salt and
pepper so grind
salt black
pepper and
then mix it
in and throughout this process the heat
is on its lowest
setting so to recap we've taken the
liver out of the
fridge 20 minutes before cooking so it
reaches room
temperature then we've put some oil in
this frying pan on a very lowest on this
lowest heat put the liver in let it cook
for a few minutes while that's cooking
you prepare your
onion uh your potatoes are on the boil
obviously
and chop your onion add the onion let it
cook for a further 2 or 3 minutes add
two oxos as I did but you can add to
taste um as I say you can use Gravy
granules uh these stock pots as well
whatever you want but I use two oxos
that's the way it was done for
me and let it simmer like that on a very
low heat adding potato water or any
other vegetables you're
boiling um in my case today it's
potatoes that adds to the flavor of the
gravy uh We've added now it's simmering
away nice and slow and I've added salt
and pepper now the only thing I'm going
to add to this now is flour about a
teaspoon of flour it'll become
lumpy don't worry about that that's part
of it that will dissolve as it simmers
and what that'll do it it'll give a nice
thick gravy so we'll add the flour
now so here we go and don't worry about
sving it or all that just sort of
sprinkle it with a
spoon and that'll give us the thickness
for the gravy you can use corn flour if
you
wish but uh don't worry bu being lumpy
anything like that just Stir It In
[Applause]
and if you need to you can add more
water from the
potatoes right I don't know if you can
tell but it has thickened up now I've
added no more water anything like that
um how zoom in a
bit absolutely fantastic I wish you
could smell this actually um another
thing some people do is when they get
the liver at the beginning they dip like
you would uh batter in a fish they dip
the liver into flour like that and then
fry it um I don't do it like that this
is the way it's always been done by my
grandmother so I'm following that recipe
and as you can see or hopefully see it's
um works very well potatoes are nearly
ready now so we'll leave this as I say
simmer on a low heat nice and
gentle and um in fact I'm going to have
a taste of this
gravy let's see what
happens oh my
word okay now that is good
eating right potatoes already so I've
drained them and all I need to do now is
give them a
mash and as I say I've done a lot
because this will do me two
meals and you'll find it tastes
fantastic but the liver
tomorrow uh I leave it cool down what I
don't use and
then put it in the fridge and then
reheat it tomorrow and The Taste the
second
day is even better than it today cuz
it's marinated in its own gravy
overnight and for very little money I'd
say about all this cost about Â£250 if
that and I'm having two very good
meals
um so I'm very happy with that right
that should do it
so I'll plate up and I'll get back to
you so here we have it put some liver
on oh this is how I do it
anyway and I'm not
forgetting the gravy it's thick gravy
how I like
it
and it's as simple as that
really so there you
go liver and onions and mashed potatoes
done the old fashioned
way so here we go with a taste test I've
just put some black pepper on top so
we'll have a piece of
liver that's a piece of that on this
lovely tender cooked where I to
Perfection bit of
mash bit of
[Music]
gravy so I hope you enjoyed the video I
hope people find it interesting or
helpful and uh thanks for watching and
I'll speak to you soon take care
