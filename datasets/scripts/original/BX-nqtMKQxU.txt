hi my name is Ruthie in my video I will
show you how to build a birdhouse at a
t111 as you can see I've already made
pre-cut all the word in the sizes that I
need one side is rough one side is
smooth
in the description I've listed the
materials and measurements to build this
bird house these are the tools we're
going to be using some screws some brad
nailer the drill and the uh brad nailer
gun uh now first off you're going to
have to take some time with me we're
going to set this up so we
can see how it goes
before we nail
it this will be the roof something like
this and the hole will be right here
well first off this part right here you
want it this to be thick it's a
protectant guard for the animals inside
so when you make your hole there's a a
bigger distance in between here to
protect the the little young okay before
I get started I'm going to need to make
an entrance way right here here 2 in
from the top with a 1 and 1 12 in
diameter you just bring it to the drill
press right here and we'll set it
down oops
taada now you have a perfectly round
hole we're going to start with the floor
and we're going to use the one of the
sides as just the guide to hold it there
so we're going to take this we're going
to attach the floor just like that and
I'm going to turn it so I can shoot it
in
there got to make sure it's
flush take the
nailer shoot it in
there okay
that's now we're going to turn
it and then nail it
okay so now we're going to take the the
this side and put it on there but with
this side we're going to make it to
where we can open it in order to clean
it out so we're going to pre-drill our
holes which we only need one screw right
here
okay now we also want to drill a hole on
the back side we are going to drill a
hole on from the floor from the bottom
of the floor to the left side
here so after you've done drilled your
hole we're going to put a screw in
here to hold it in place
before I finish you want to score the
wood a few times in order for the little
birds to hop out and go from
there okay that's the side now we're
going to do the back
this side we're going to
nail okay that should
do now we're going to take this from the
back Center it
up all right we're going to grind these
out put the roof on you want to make
sure it's even on both
sides just
checking all right you want to shoot the
front right here and not in the circle
of the hole you have a 2 in right here
so stand back from it
beautiful all right now and you also
want to take and make sure that this is
nice and smooth so the chicks do not get
that in their mouth we're going to put
some fent holes in
here just
F I would want to put some in the back
on the bottom end in the corners but
away from the
edges and this will help with
ventilation and
drainage now we're going to pop a few
holes in the back of this thing right
here in order to hang it on the tree so
[Music]
here you should do
it now you've made your own
birdhouse it's ready to go on the tree
okay looks good let's go hang it
up there you go
now I'm going to show you to take the
side off for the clean
out oops okay now you can clean it out
and wash it
out and then all you have to do is slide
it right back together
put your screw back
in place it
in hold
on place it back
in and we'll get the other one on the
bottom and there you go homemade
birdhouse check it out
