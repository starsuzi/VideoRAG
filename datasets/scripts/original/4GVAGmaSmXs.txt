okay so today we're going to be making
lollipops uh it's very simple and easy
way to make lollipops using things that
you can find in the shops and around
your home so the basic ingredients are
as
[Music]
follows to make this the equipment
you're going to need is
[Music]
the first step is to put our
sugar and our cream of
TARTA and our water into a SAU
spoon then we simply heat it
up and stir until all the sugar is
dissolved now the cream of TARTA an
interfering agent that will stop sugar
crystals forming and hopefully leave us
with a nice clear glossy lolli pop at
the
end okay so our Sugar's now starting to
reach a stage where it's uh
bubbling and at this point we want to
pop in our sugar
thermometer and turn the heat down
slightly cuz we don't want our sugar to
get really hot and
burn so the temperature that we're
looking for is hard crack and it's
approximately
152Â° CSUS now if you don't have a sugar
thermometer just heat it for around 10
minutes and take little spoonfuls out as
you go along and drop it into ice cold
water what you're looking for is the
sugar to set very hard very quickly and
then be snappable and that's when you've
reached the correct temperature hard
crack what I'm going to do is take a
spoonful of the mixture out and drop it
into cold water now the way that it
behaves once it hits the water will tell
you what stage you're at if you don't
have a sugar th
okay so just going to take a teaspoon
out and drop it into the
water at the moment we're not even at
soft ball stage so it just forms a blob
at the bottom and if we then stir it you
can see take some of that out it's kind
of just a gloopy soft sugar
syrup okay so it's now reached uh the
temperature that we're looking for and
I'm going to demonstrate that by taking
a spoonful and just dropping it into
this cold
water okay so we're just going to pop
that straight into cold water and what
we're looking for is for it to set hard
and basically crack and it's setting in
the water and when we take it
out it should crack so I'm going to take
some of this out it's set nice and firm
you can see there and if you try and
break it you'll find that it just breaks
down into lots of little pieces so I'm
going to pop in my yellow food coloring
now a couple of drops should be more
than enough try not to stir it too much
at this stage because it can cause the
sugar to crisp crystallize and set very
hard very quickly and then uh you're not
going to be able to make your
lollies so we're just going to get some
oil onto our piece of Grease prooof
paper just to make sure that our lollies
don't
stick so we're now at the consistency
we're looking for it's runny but it
hopefully will hold a bit of shape when
we put it straight onto our sheet so you
get a spoonful of the
mixture just going to pop it onto
now sheet there making a circle as we
go just
repeat this mixture should make about 20
lollies now before your mixture sets you
want to make sure you take your lollipop
stick just press it down into the back
of your lli give it a little
twist and that should make sure it gets
completely incorporated into your
mixture
so I'm popping the stick in pressing it
down and just gently twisting it from
side to side until the
sugar covers the whole stick you can
keep your lollies for 2 to 3 weeks after
the day you've made them and for storing
them you're going to need to put them
making sure they're not touching between
layers of Grease proof paper and an
airtight container and that's how to
make
lollipops
