asalam alaikum and welcome to title's
busy kitchen with me titly nhan you've
probably already seen my recipe for no
cooked cheesecake well today I'm going
to bake a cheesecake two reasons one I
like cheesecake and two I don't need a
reason to bake a
cheesecake for this cheesecake I've got
12 mcvi digestive B biscuits or you
could use graham crackers or Ginger nuts
for something a bit more spicy 500 G of
masconi cheese 200 g of creme fresh or
thick cream 175 G of castor sugar 2
tbspoon of flour three eggs 75 G of
melted butter and half a teaspoon of
vanilla
Essence the first thing we need to do is
break up the biscuits to make the base
so I'll just pop them in this bag just
fold over the top of the bag now we need
to crush them with something heavy like
a rolling pin or a frying pan or a large
cat or even a slightly Rusty sledg
ha that looks really nice oh yes all
crummy now put the Biscuit Crumbs into a
bowl pour on the melted
butter then mix
well now take an 8 in cake tin this
one's got a popup bottom to help me get
the cheesecake out add in the biscuit
and butter
mix spread it around and press it down
firmly I find the back of a soup spoon
helps as well to get it smooth and
even now we'll bake this in the oven at
150° C for just 5 minutes put the
masconi cheese in a large bowl and add
in the creeme fresh or thick
cream then whisk them together
gently then sift in the flour sprinkle
in the sugar and
mix after a few minutes mixing you'll
end up with this really creamy mixture
don't mix it more than you need to
because you don't want to incorporate
too much air into this now whisk the
eggs in a
bowl then pour them into the cheesecake
mix
together with the vanilla
Essence and mix
gently and you should end up with this
lovely creamy
mixture now pour the mixture over the
cooked
base tap it to bring any bubbles to the
surface or use a power sander to shake
it oh that feels
good now I'll pop this in the oven at
150° C for 50 minutes but because I
don't want the cheesecake to dry out and
crack I'm also going to put in a small
baking tray with about half an inch of
water in it after about 15 minutes the
cheesecake should be kind of wobbly like
a blonge that's fine pop it back in the
oven turn off the heat and allow the
cheesecake to cool in the
oven this took about 5 hours to cool in
the oven and then I popped it in the
fridge overnight now I'll just get it
out of its
tin then use a spatula to just prize it
away from the
base then slide it onto a
plate now the really cool thing about
this is every time I bake a cheesecake
anyway I end up with a raised Edge which
means that the center is perfect for
putting fruit in I'm going to decorate
mine with
blueberries and what I'm going to do
first of all is take some Jam this
happens to be blackberry jam cuz I can't
get blueberry jam and I'll melt this in
the
microwave once it's melted pour some on
of a
cheesecake and just spread it around
this is just going to act as a glue for
the fruit so you don't really need much
at
all now put the fruit
on M I love blueberries then when
they're all in place just dust lightly
with icing
sugar and
serve cheesecake with a delicious creamy
texture that just melts in your mouth
whoever coined the phrase using a
sledgehammer to crack a nut obviously
never baked a
cheesecake join me next time in title's
busy kitchen with me TI until next time
