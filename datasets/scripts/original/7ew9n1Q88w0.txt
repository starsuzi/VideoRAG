we're about to find out
welcome to icing on social media where
normal people have viral social media
books send a text so a couple of awesome
friends of the page Stacy and charlo
have shared a video as a five-minute
light pack or five-minute crafts showing
that you can unclog a clogged toilet
using saran wrap like if you really want
to stick your hands down there on a
clogged toilet so what we're going to do
is we're going to clog our toilets and
see if we can use saran wrap to unclog
it
we know this bullet clogs up fairly easy
and it also unclog fairly easy so we're
going to clog it with some toilet paper
hopefully that do it
[Laughter]
okay it looks like our toilet is now
clogged

you're making yourself not just look at
sounding competent all right fourth
piece let's do this there's a four piece
of scrap all right the toilet is
completely covered in saran wrap I'm
going to flush it get in close to ready
here we go
they keep going down
[Music]

[Music]
maybe another piece why is there
something to eat
it's back in the seals
[Music]
we feel still looming there
[Music]
you feel like it's not getting sealed
but they're hard in that part all right
let me do that carefully turkeys here
I'm trying to make sure with that okay
here we go one more time it's on there
