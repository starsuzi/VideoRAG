it's been a while
i've had school coming to an end and
finals and all that stuff so i probably
should have my hand examined for doing
this
now because i still have one final this
evening
let's hope i don't have to wear a diaper
that final
um hormel pork hawks feet
pork in a jar i've seen these on the
shelf for ages and i've always
been tempted but never gone through with
it
so today we'll give them a try
they're boneless packed in vinegar and
from some of the other movies i've seen
that's a lot of vinegar so uh
let's get to it
smells like vinegar let's pour off
some of this magical juice just a second
let's hope we don't have that sound
later so
there is
the vinegar is probably just
broke down all of the
connective tissue and all that
big ol lump of skin
i've seen other people recently that
posted uh
pickled pickled pigs feet videos and uh
didn't look like there was a whole lot
of meat um
wow nothing like
fat dissolved in acid
um this doesn't look too bad i mean
i still have to get a good recipe for
cooking them but hey
pigging and footing and let's get back
to the movie
so let's see big old chunks of beet
it tastes like ham
actually the vinegar is very light
go hormel um
there's not a whole lot of fat
got a little bit of that
vinegar flavor
the vinegar kind of builds more more you
eat but
um i mean this piece right here
except for a little tiny bit of fat
that's a big chunk of meat
all right i don't even see that
that is a big old chunk of ham
okay it's not ham
i mean it's still got
all connective tissue around it
but the vinegar is broken all that down
there's not a whole it's not like it's i
always thought it was just fat and skin
because the pigs feed i got in the
freezer
don't have oh i'm sorry these are pork
hawks that's why there's so much meat
they're not pig's feet
i take that back
pig's feet in a jar might actually be
horrible
i don't know
but uh i have to go look at the shelf
again
i've only seen that jar
but uh
i like pickled stuff
i uh i really don't think i'm gonna be
eating that water fat
mmm get out to this
um no
i know it preserves it
but uh
the only thing i can see that would be
offsetting to somebody
if they were eating this is if you don't
if you're not a fan of vinegar
probably shouldn't eat this and
there's other people that don't eat
swine
well for being filthy animals
pigs tur sure tastes uh magically
delicious
oh there you go
questions answered i always wondered how
it tasted
like i said i'm not going to eat a strip
of fat
soaked in vinegar but uh there's still
big chunks of meat on here
um it's not like
i would go buy fresh
basically these are the front shin on
the pig
i don't think i would actually go out
and buy them and do this
if i were to get them i would roast them
but uh
it's not spectacular but it's not
horrible i don't think i'll give it a
two thumbs up because it's not like i'm
gonna go buy a case of this stuff
but uh other than that mystery solved
now i know what it tastes like uh i'm
assuming the pig's feet
would be about the same they would taste
the same but with
less meat
there we go poor
i guess these are just poor
bye
you
