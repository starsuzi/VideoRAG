what's up everybody this is deck411
and this is how to make a cheese
sandwich or grilled cheese
and yourself strawberry uh first you
have to
prepare the bread and you do that
as you can see you put cheese on top of
the bread
and you would bread on top
anyway you just put the cheese on top of
the bread that's how you prepare the
bread
with the way i do it in the toaster oven
first i put the when you prepare it
you're gonna have two pieces of bread
sauce up the bread
with nothing on it on top and i put the
cheese red on the bottom
and that's starting to blur up so i'm
gonna move
all right i do that and then i put
tougher on
stuff around for five minutes it's
usually done by the end
well sometimes overdone but it's always
good to check
because it usually should only take
three minutes
so i just put it on fire just in case
i turn it on i don't know
it says toast or bake
and i want to toast it so put it on that
now put it in between 350
and uh
for 400 so
you can be on 400 or only 350 and
network
so yeah that's it and my next video will
be the
end result since i don't want to like
wait
well peace out
