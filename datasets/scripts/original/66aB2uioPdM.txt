hi there I'm Paula from famous Chic
Emporium and today we're going to do a
really simple project that I think you
might enjoy
um I've spent the last half an hour
literally the last half an hour
scrubbing the labels off these eight
bottles
um some of them come off really easy and
you think yay and then the next one
takes forever and you're just scrubbing
and scrubbing
so
in cases like this one you get little
bits that are just left that just will
not come off but that's fine don't worry
about it too much it will be perfectly
covered with the paint so the other
things that you need for this project is
obviously paint a brush
we're going to need some finishing coat
one of these kind of brushes
and a pop to put your finishing coat in
now this
or the little present given to me by
Father Christmas which I thought was
rather Incycle of him these gorgeous
ducking rabbit napkins
that we're gonna apply to these bottles
today so I'm going to show you how to do
this decoupage this is one of the most
simplest forms of decoupage in my
experience and it's a project that I
think anyone can do and I think you'll
probably really enjoy it so what I'm
going to do first now I've got the
labels off is
use the paint to paint the bottles
underneath as well and I'm going to have
to use my hair dryer to speed the drying
process up so once we've got a bit
further down the line I'll show you
where we're at okay see you in a bit oh
yeah right we've done one coat of
wedding cake which is quite a pure white
and I wanted to say as you can see this
bottle doesn't look as well covered but
that's because it's a green bottle you
can use both it's not a problem it will
cover so don't worry about whether it's
a white bottle or a green bottle it
covers out everything it just might need
a little bit extra pain and as you can
also see all of the bottles are
different shapes and sizes some have
grooves in some have dents in
some are quite fat and round some are
tall and thin it doesn't matter I get my
bottles from all over the place I've
asked my friends to save them for me I
genuinely haven't drank every last drop
that's come out of this bottle as
tempting as it might be so I've often
come home of a day of working to find a
whole
ton of bottles waiting for me on my
doorstep which makes me looks like algae
of the street but that's what you've got
to do you can also go into pubs and ask
them to save you bottles they're quite
happy to do that most of the time so
there's lots of ways of sourcing this
free thing and then upcycling it into
something absolutely gorgeous
so decoupage
which is what we're going to be doing
today is literally meaning sticking
something on to something else so you
can use lots of things for decoupage and
today we're going to be using paper
napkins but you can use cardstock you
can use fabric you can use wallpaper you
can use pictures that you've printed off
from the computer it it's still all
called decoupage it's just a means of
decorating and making something pretty
so I'm going to carry on painting
because obviously more coverage is
needed and then we'll come back when
they're all painted completely white
right
right so I've got my bunny I've got my
little pot of finishing coat and I've
Got My Little Brush so I'm going to work
out roughly where I want me grab it
so
I'm going to use my brush
and just slosh the finishing coat on now
it's not exact it doesn't have to be
exact because it dries fairly matte and
we're going to be finishing the rest of
the bottle off with finishing coat
anyway so I just want to make the area
wet evenly wet
running
it's important that we put the finishing
coat on the bottle not on the back of
the paper because that would totally
dissolve it
so I've placed the bunny
onto my wet patch and I'm using my brush
to very gently
smooth out
from the center outwards
now where the background was wedding
cake and white and so was the background
of the bunny
napkin white the white is just
dissolving into
the bottle
so it just looks like a picture of a
bunny has been almost hand painted on so
that's the secret of good decoupages to
find something with the same color
background as what you've
painted
so as you can see it's looking over
splendid
carry on
painting with the bottles in exactly the
same way

foreign
[Music]
they went on really easily even in the
dips and the bumps of the different
bottles it hasn't really affected it at
all they just look great so what I'm
going to do now is go over the rest of
all of the bottles with finishing coat
which will protect them
so I'll pop back in a bit
okay
so as you can see I've finished off most
of the bottles leaving the last one
to show you how I did it and usually I
use
um a glue gun which I haven't actually
used today but I usually use a glue gun
to put lace and I cut sections like that
and here is an example of the lace on it
and I would literally wrap it round
and put some Blobs of glue there stick
it on
and some Globs of glue on the top and
stick it over the top and then I do
another layer and maybe even another
layer
so that's one option there's also ribbon
which you could do exactly the same I
think I could particularly went with the
image
so I'm using this Garden twine which is
brilliant I bought this from the range
it was about six pounds but it's lasted
me forever I'm getting near the end now
but it was a big wrap and it's it's got
bendy nurse in it so I don't need
the um
glue gun I can just twist it
like you would a sandwich tie
and then I'm gonna just overlap the edge
so it's all neat and tidy
and then wrap it round
fairly
hazardly
I don't really want it solid I want some
of the white showing
so there we are now I'm going to cut
option off
wrap it around find the bit that's loose
tuck it in
and go around a bit further and find a
loop and just tuck it in
and I can bend it back on itself
so it won't come undone
yeah lovely
so I hope you've learned something and
we'll have a go at this really easy
upcycling project it's been fun I love
the results
