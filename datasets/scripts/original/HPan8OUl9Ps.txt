Hi and a huge welcome to Steve's Kitchen look
I've had a request from a viewer called
Sharon or Shawit her channel
and its what is clotted cream? and how do
you make it
well that's two questions really what is
clotted cream well that's fascinating
I grew up with clotted cream it's just
phenomenal it comes from the west
of England it's a delicious thick
clotted cream as it says but
unfortunately
if you want to try you've either  really got
to get down to the West of England
or make it yourself because they sell
it in the supermarkets and I've had it
all over the world from supermarkets it
never tastes anything like real clotted
cream
so really if you want to enjoy clotted
creams as it's meant to be  you're got to make it
yourself
how was it made in the old days when you
had the old ranges or Argas the big
fires in the kitchens
the wives would take the thickened
cream and I've got a
pint of it  here a thickened cream and
they would put it in
a big flat dish in the warming
tray
of the oven and leave it overnight and
overnight that would warm through and a
big crust
would set a clot across the top
of the cream and that is clotted cream
once that's cool
down you pop that on to ice cream it's
a cross between
butter and and whipped cream it's just
phenomenal in flavor
so you pop that on your ice cream it's
just
heaven so now I'm going to show you a
modern way
how we can make clotted cream at home and
if you haven't tried it before
give this a go it's fantastic come over
here
let me show you how
now I've got a nice pint of fresh cream here
this is the thick cream you would use
for whipping up
to make fresh cream and I've also got
another pint here in a glass dish the
reason that I'm using the glass dish
is so I can show you how the clotted
cream makes and this dish here
is my clotted cream dish this is the one I would
normally use and I'm doing
two pints you might as well make extra
because if you're going to the trouble of
making clotted cream
once you've done it everybody's going to
want some off you so  you might as well
make
two pints at least and if only I have
been asked to do this a few years ago
when I used to live in my old farmhouse
because we had a big range there now I'm
going to have to use a domestic cooker
which is fine works perfectly well so I
taken one pint of this thick cream
and I'm using two dishes you want dishes
with the big surface area because
that's where all the goodness happens
the clotted cream on the top
so you can see I've got about an inch
deep there and I've got another tray
here I'm going to put this
other pint into there just pour it in
and the reason I used the glass one  as I
say is so you can see what's going on but
this one is the one I would normally use
so now I've got these two trays here
with my cream in
and they have to go in to just a warm
oven now we're looking about
eighty degrees Celsius that's about 180
degrees fahrenheit
and we want to pop these in the oven
overnight now they'll be in for at least 10
hours maybe a little bit longer
depending on your oven
now another way you could do this is in
a double boiler on the stove but you've
got to keep in an eye
on it all the time it takes absolutely
ages so it's much simpler
to put this in the oven get to bed wake
up the next morning your
clotted cream is ready now if you've got
a fan assisted oven
you might want to tweak that temperature
down just a little bit it'll dry quicker
in a fan oven but that is actually good
so just
tweak it down a little bit
okay the following morning it was about
12 hours my clotted cream was in the oven for
and we've got this beautiful golden  
buttery
surface on top of the cream and on this
clear one I can show you
it's reduced down by about fifty percent
well maybe forty percent down and
the top surface here is this beautiful
clotted cream
we need to leave this for about 15-20
minutes let the pots cool down a little
bit
and I'm going to pop them in the fridge let them
completely cool down
and then we'll prepare the clotted cream
well there it is there is my clotted cream
out of the fridge and look at this guy's
it's beautiful and thick and clotted and
buttery
its going to taste absolutely delicious I'm going to decant  this off now into some
little
earthenware pots maybe some little Kilner
jars like this
and use a spoon and just sort of scrape
this out gently
you can see how thick that is exactly what the
clotted cream should look like we want to
keep all the clots of cream together
now this won't last all that long once
you've popped into your jars maybe two
or three days
so you want to get and use it up but we
have got to worry about that because in
Steve's Kitchen tomorrow I'm going to be
taking this
beautiful clotted cream look at that

absolutely gorgeous I'm going to be taking
