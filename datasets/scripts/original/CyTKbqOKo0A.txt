well now I'm just going to go inside
this little cubby here and get this done
and then we'll move back over
to the other side
okay so what we're going to do here is
I'm going to install this last row of
laminate we're going to use a pry bar
now there's a couple of different bars
that you can use here and I'll show you
the other one a little later but first
let's get the entire row in place now
we'll take the pry bar here I'm also
going to find a scrap piece of laminate
and what we're going to do is we're
going to use that scrap piece of
laminate AC against the wall so that we
don't pry a hole into the
sheetrock just get it in there and
you'll hear the laminate click to
together otherwise just watch for it and
you'll you can see when it clicks when
it's all together nice and tight that's
pretty much all that you
do okay so I've got one more row to put
in here before I get to this
wall and what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to figure now this row
that goes in right here I'm going to
figure that right now and so I'm going
to figure it out I'm going to make my
cuts the length of it so that they all
fit in there and then what I'm going to
do is make sure sure that none of my
joints line up where I'm going to put it
I'm actually going to use a full piece
on this one and so what I
do is now I know that this piece when I
cut it is going to go here I can cut the
rest of my row like I said put one more
piece in and then I got to cut down
there now I'd just take my cheater board
and I'd start making my
marks and just
come and keep making my marks
and then I'll come to the corner right
here and I'll just figure I'll come out
about a qu inch and stay straight on
this wall and I'll just draw my line
right there so you can
see there's my cut for this for this
next row so now remember that's going to
go in up there and so now I'm going to
go to this row now that I got this cut
and I'm going to finish that row and
then this one after I cut it will slide
in there
okay so I got this piece in so now
basically I just take it after I cut it
here now and stick it
in get it in
place and you can see how that fit in
there this is a spot I'll use this pry
bar click it
in so now I'll keep going and so
basically you just want to remember that
before you get to this row you need to
figure out where your lines are going to
line up so now I had it figured where
this line was right
here and it didn't line up with any of
them and now I'm up to here and so you
just got to kind of think about things
like that before you start making cuts
and putting them in so that you don't
have joints line up so you're really
going to estimate what the next two rows
are before you make your cuts when you
come up to a corner like this or any
kind of wall so another way that I'll
show you just to explain this a little
better I took this row right now that
I'm putting in and I got it in place so
I know that it doesn't line up with any
of the other
joints and so now that I check that now
I'm coming up to another spot right here
where I need to cut this and so is all
I'm going to do is I'll take my marker
and I'll make a mark right there where
this joint and that row lines up so now
I know that that's where it's
at now I got to figure out my next
row and so I'll just look and see where
do all these joints line up where do I
not want to put that and that looks
pretty good right
there and so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to make this cut now or not this
cut I'm going to mark this next
board so now I can just slide this in
and this one I can actually slide under
this time so I'm going to feel the wall
and I'll pull it out a little bit I make
my
mark I'll come make sure I'm going to
clear there I'll make a mark same thing
on this side make sure I'm going to
clear and I'll make another Mark so now
I'll go and Notch this
out and I'll figure out my other Cuts
right now on this other
part see if I can use this down there
I can so I'm gonna go and cut both these
boards right
now now this is a chopsaw right here and
this is a also it's a miter box we call
it a chopsaw it adjusts you can do 45s
if I can bring it back and forth or just
come straight down on it now when I'm
cutting laminate here's my marks I'll
take this and I'll just stand the board
up straight instead of like this l it is
really tough on blades and it cuts
really nicely through it if you use it
this way so I just line my blade up
right on the mark you can see right
there and now I'll just cut right
through
it now I've got one more cut here I'll
do the same
thing and I just come straight
down and that's how I like to cut with
this chopsaw instead of flat like this
it really is tough on your blades
cutting it that
way here's this other cut that we're
going to be working on this is that door
jam and I want to show you how you can
um avoid using the jigsaw the entire
time on all of these Cuts I'm just going
to bring my chopsaw right down to that
line I'm going to saw it right down to
that line and this one actually is not
there all the way so I'll just kind of
draw it a little
bit and now what I do is I just come
straight
down hold it
tight and now you can see I made both of
those cuts already so now I'll just come
in at an angle with my jigsaw and finish
cutting the rest of it and that saves
you some cutting
[Applause]
what's really nice is when you get those
cuts way down there and you can chop use
the chopsaw to get most of it so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
this board in before I put this Row in
and the reason why is because I want it
to go in there easy and so what I do is
I slide this board in where it's
supposed to
go and now I'll take this
roll and I'll start putting this
in I'll get this out of the way a little
bit okay so now what I'm going to do is
start with this row now now I have this
Row in this is already slid under my Jam
there so I'm not going to have any
issues getting it in now I'm going to
start putting in this next
row and this is just going to
be a little bit of work to get it in
there but it's really going to go pretty
simple actually now I'm going to grab
underneath the middle of this board or I
can tap from that side but I lift up the
middle and I keep that end down and
that's how I'm going to get it to lock
in there now I'll get it in place
and this is where my tapping block comes
in and now you see how nicely that's
in and now what I can do cuz I already
have this piece in I can just cut a
piece that's going to fit fit in here
and set it right on top of
here and then just use my cheater
board
still so I can just set the board right
on top of here
