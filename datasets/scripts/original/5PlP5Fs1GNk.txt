with my
[Music]
tuner
okay the action is definitely
High okay first thing I'm going to
do is loosen up these two back
screws take my allen wrench
and change the neck angle by tightening
this and pushing it
out okay that
looks pretty good be a little bit too
much I'm going to tighten up the
screws and that's good now now I can
raise my Saddles To Where I want so take
my
ruler go back to the 11th and 12th
fret and H and I'm going to set this
because this guitar you can set each
saddle individually because they're
separate Saddles and I would set each
one to 23 seconds to a 16th and see how
I like it because this guitar I would
want more even low to high because the
radius of the board is different and so
I got a tremolo so I want more of an
even feel that's what I like it it you
might like one side high that low side
higher than the other just you know
that's up to you it's all preference but
whatever it is use a ruler so you know
where you are so you know how high you
have each string and make them the same
and from there take it step by step
slowly this is set at a 16th all the way
across now we're going to talk about the
claw in the
back and what it does
the tighter the claw the further these
screws are into the body the more it
pulls the Springs the tighter the
tremolo will be when you push down on
it some people like it tight some people
make it completely tight and don't use
the arm don't use the
tremolo if you're going to use the
tremolo don't make it too tight cuz what
can happen is if you push down on this
and it's too tight it's locked up you
can break you actually can break break
the arm the threads will break right off
but adjust it to what feels good to you
adjust it to what works best for the
guitar so that when you use it and you
hit the tremolo and you let go the
guitar comes back in tune now some
people like it leaning a little bit like
this so they can pull up on the bar not
only push down cuz on this you can only
push down some people like to set it
where they can pull up to shake strings
to to raise the pitch of it because
that's what the tremolo does low is the
pitch but if you don't then this will
not raise if it's laying on the body but
if you set it where it's leaning forward
a little you can raise the
pitch again all preference it's what you
like it's what works for you and how you
play and what you want out of the guitar
okay I'm going to loosen the claw cuz
it's in too tight now the reason it be
so tight if you're not going to use the
tremolo some people put it in that tight
cuz they think this way to lock the
tremolo up and it won't you know slip as
much it'll stay in tune
better stay in tuned better and all that
this is real
tight I'm going to back it
off see the screws are coming out of the
body and it's making the claw move
forward this is the claw you're going to
Springs that it's
tight
now if you go too far what's going to
happen is the tremol is going to start
to lean on you like it same way as if
you were pushing down on it but we're
not going to do
that
okay also if it's too tight you got too
many Springs in it you can break the
tremolo bar off okay I'm going to flip
it over and try the
tremolo
it still feels a little tight see I want
it to come back to the body but I don't
want it to snap back too hard so I'm
going to loosen the claw a little bit
more again this is one of those
adjustments you have to find what feels
good to
you and see what works best to keep the
instrument in
tune all right that's pretty good see
it's coming back to the same spot every
time but it's not really tight or really
loose it's right in the
middle
[Music]
okay and it works pretty
well
