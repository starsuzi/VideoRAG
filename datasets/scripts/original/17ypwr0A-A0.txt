hello everyone welcome to my Channel
today I'm going to show you how to make
pajama pants um for this I've got this
fabric its length is the desired length
you want for your pajama pants and add
three more inches to it for adjustments
and width will be the half of your hips
measurement and add uh 6 in to it so the
length of my pajama pants is 33 so I
have added 3 in so it makes 36 in and
width is um uh the half of the hips so
the hips of my pajama pants is 30 so
half of 30 is 15 and I'll add 6 in to it
so it makes
21 so width is 21 so you have to take
the two pieces of fabric with the same
measurement so both the right sides
together keep on each other and
then fold in
half from the
middle like this now from the top side
this is the top side take 1 and
A2 take 1 and A2 from the top and make a
line like
this so this will be the fold for the
elastic and similarly we will give a
line downside
also 1 and a half of
lines now this will be for the folding
at the
bottom
so now this is the open side you can see
the here we have got four layers and
this is the unfold side so from the
folded side from down 1 and 1/2 in I'll
take the 1/3 of my hips measurement for
the crotch
area so the hips for my pajama pants is
30 in so the 1/3 of 30 in is 10 in so
I'll go 10 in
down so from here I'll go 10 in
down and make a 1 and A2 of line from
this
part
remember you have to measure your 1/3 of
your hips measurement from this line not
from the top from this
line now make a
line so this is our crotch area and now
I'll make a/ in of line here
on this
corner just a/ inch of line and make a
curve touching this half inch of line
I'll make a
curve and now from this point I'll go
down
bottom whatever you want to give you can
give but here I'm leaving just 1
in 1 and 1/2
in and join these two points with the
line this now we will cut this out
now the crunch
area
and to the
top so this way are cutting of the
pajama pants are
ready this way I have got these two
pieces of
fabric for the both the
legs
so this one and this one now we will
join this and I'll tell you how to
stitch it so here I would like to tell
you that uh the crunch area the cronch
area that we have given here at the at
this side the one and a half this
depends on the size also so this is the
size small that I'm
uh stitching so the hips measurement is
just 30 so that's why I'm taking one uh
1 and a/2 but if your hips is um large
size you you have to take 2 in 2 in is
uh the ideal for the uh heavy persons
like or a large persons actually the two
two or 2 and A2 is the ideal size but
but 1 and a half is good for the kids or
a small small size now we will join the
crotch area for that what you have to do
is the right side facing both the right
sides of the
legs start stitching from here to top so
I'll bin this and I'll tell you how to
do
this
so when we will Stitch this it will
look like this from the
inside like
this so let's Stitch
this so here is the crotch area and now
I'll take it to the
top
leaving half an inch of
Gap
similarly I'll Stitch the another one
also so here I have attached both
the uh Parts it's looking like
this and this is the back side
side and now we will fold the top part
one and a half line that we have given
at the time of measurement Till There we
will make a fold for that take a little
bit of fabric and then make a double
fold and take it down to this 1 and 1/2
in of line and make a fold like
this now Stitch this all over the waist
area like
this leaving just 1 in of Gap here to
insert
elastic just a small fold and then a
fold with till 1 and 1/2 in inch of line
that you have
given like this all over the base line
so here on the edges I'll give a
stitch so now I have stitched
here all over the waist line
here I have given a space for the
elastic so with the help of safet pin
I'll insert an
elastic and take it
around the waist
Line This fold and I'll take this around
the waist
part
and
take it out from the another part from
here and then I'll Stitch it and then
close this part and after
that we will give the Stitch here the 1
and 1/2 in of line that we have given
for the bottom fold at the time of
measurement we will fold this
so for this you have to give a double
fold one and then still the
line
here like
this Fold
It similarly you have to do the another
leg
also so now I have inserted the elastic
here on the top and then closed that Gap
and now we will close the leg part for
that start the stitching from the one
part of your leg from the down
side and just giving 1 in of Gap or half
an inch of Gap start
stitching and go to the top and then
turn and come to the another leg and
similarly go
down so here our pajama pants is
ready
from the top it's looking like
this and here is the Stitch that we have
given I have started it from here and
then up at this point and
then came to the another side and then
came down and ended here so from the
wrong side it's looking looking like
this and our pajama pants is ready to
wear so this is how our pajama pants are
looking it's ready to
wear uh from the back side it's looking
like this and from the front side it's
looking like this this is a comfortable
pajama pants that you can wear at home
and this measurement you can apply on
the children's or adults anybody and uh
the result will be the
same I hope you liked it so if you are
