hey guys in today's video I'm going to
show you how to make these wooden
Planters waterproof them paint them
antique them and put the words on them
and then we're going to put a clear coat
over them they're pretty simple to make
if you like the Planters but you don't
want to make one yourself you'd like a
chance to win one of these stay tuned to
the end of the video and there'll be
three different chances to win one the
details right at the end thanks for
watching I'm using some of this leftover
Poor Man's Cherry flooring that I did my
house with
when we built it you can use any
leftover wood you have I ripped mine
down to 3 and 1/2 in wide if you need to
go to the store you can go buy some the
4in wide boards will work perfect for
what you need I'm using a DeWalt miter
saw if you don't have an electric one
you can buy a hand saw with one of the
miter boxes I'm going to cut 45s on each
end
so once you have your first 45Â° angle
cut we're going to Mark
16 use our
Square for our nice
line once you have your two
16s we're going to do our
cut our two 5 in long pieces now for the
ends so one little trick to do at this
point is just to roughly assemble it
before you cut your floor so once you
just have it sitting together nice we're
just going to go ahead and measure the
inside
dimensions we have 14 1/2 by 3
1/2 so
if this measurement inside me
measurement doesn't
equal this measurement now is the time
that you can
adjust your end pieces if so now once I
have it cut just going to lay it down
and dry fit everything before I put it
all together it's dry fit
together should look like that if your
lines don't all line
up this is when you need to make your
adjustments either cutting off a little
bit of your 5 in long pieces or cutting
another piece and making it a little
bit wide
longer while it all dry fit
together we're going to grab our
glue and our
nails so I'm using a brad nailer with 1
in Long
Brads and
glue if you want you can use a screw gun
and screws
I'm just going to make sure I always
nail it
from the 5 in wide side so that way when
you're looking at it from this angle or
this angle you don't see Nails you're
only going to see Nails nail holes or
screws whatever you use from this side
just apply some
glue to the ends you're going to nail
together at this
time you just want to make sure
your ends are all flushed up so now once
you have your box
assembled you're going to take your
floor put glue on all four sides get it
in place then you're going to nail it in
place also you have it in place flip it
over now we're just going to go ahead
and run some Nails along the
bottom so now after you glued it screwed
it or nailed it together let it dry and
then once it's dry
I go ahead and I sand the tops and the
corners and all the sides down
quickly with a piece of 220
[Music]
sandpaper so now at this point I'm just
going to do some indoor outdoor sealant
I'm just using brown cuz this is what I
had you just want to make sure it's a
good indoor
outdoor so it'll be
watertight for the planter just going to
run a bead in the
corners that's what it should look
like so now when you're masking off you
just want to make sure you cover the
whole lip all the way around
just push the tape down on the top Edge
leave the
overhang just lying like this for now
just take your
newspaper and stick it to the back
side of the tape
then you're going to need some of this
Flex SE I have CLA cuz that's what I had
in the house if you have black any color
it doesn't
matter the reason why I use the flex
seil and all the edges is it makes
it watertight and you don't have to
worry about having another
liner in the planter which is nice now
I'm just using a matte finish paint to
paint the
[Music]
planter I'm just going to give it one
good
coat now you want to make sure you got
all your drips and runs wiped off want
to make sure it's got a good even coat
you don't want to worry about brush
mocks or being too perfect we're going
to sand it down anyways so once this
paint dries I'll come back and we'll do
the next step all right guys once the
paint's completely dry we're going to
take a piece of 220 sandpaper and sand
the whole thing down a little bit I'll
sand it and I'll show you what it looks
like all right guys when you're all said
and done the Box should look like
this so to make the word I went on my
computer and picked a font in a size I
liked typed up the word I
wanted printed it off then I used a
paper cutter to make sure I had a
straight line to go by I taped the word
to the planter box and then I went over
it and traced it with a ballpoint pen
and if you need to you can trace it a
couple of times if you don't get a deep
enough impression so once you're all
said and done you should have a good
impression of the word on top of the
wood so when you're happy with the
impression that you made that you can
see it clearly you take a fine point sh
Sharpie and go around and trace
it once you have the
outline grab a regular shopie and color
it in
then once you've gone over it and you
got it all colored in the way you want
it you take another another piece of 220
sandpaper and sand that back down and
get it faded all right so once you have
your word on there the way you like it
sanded down faded out as much as you
want dark as you want you can leave it
black if you want
I'm using some valve Spa signature clar
protection just putting a clar protector
over all of it to seal it up nice I'm
going to do two coats I definitely
recommend using a foam
brush so do one coat let it dry go back
and do a second one one thing you should
do first is wipe it down with a damp Rag
and let it dry to make sure you get all
the dust off
once you know you got a good first coat
on it just go around see if you got any
drips or lines and wipe them down and
even them out let it dry and go back and
give it a second one
