hi there I'm Matt from the underground
cookery school today I'm just going to
show you a really simple easy
recipe well let's just prep them to
begin with the first thing I'm going to
do is take out um the
tip do it just like
that and I want to I'm going to actually
stuff these with onions just to get more
flavor into them so just make sure that
you go really deep in um so we've done a
few of these in advance and what I'm
going to do
now is I have a pan of boiling water on
the
go and I'm just going to pop these in
and boil
them like so now here's the really key
thing
um when you cook turnips I do find they
go very bitter so in order to stop
turnips from going bitter if you just
add some baking powder in there put the
lid
up that should take away the
bitterness pop a pan on
there grab my olive
oil bring that up to a reasonable heat
what I'm going to do is fry these these
onions off and I'm also going to use
some smoked paprika and what will happen
is the onion will absorb all the paprika
um and what we'll then do is stuff um
the turnip um with the cooked onion and
it'll give it that lovely taste but
we're going to do a couple of things
extra to them before we get to that
level um well those turnips have been
cooking for probably about 6 or 7
minutes so I'm just going to them
off um and
actually you could eat those now and
they would be fine but um I really want
to make this a bit more interesting um
so the first thing I'm going to do is
just take the bottoms off so that you
can stand them up those are all now
prepped and I'm just going to stuff them
with uh the onions which have inherited
this lovely um smoke paprika flavor um
so as soon as those are all ready you
can come
back I'm just going to add a little bit
of uh olive oil to the top you'll see
why in a
sec and then just a
sprinkling a brown sugar just to
caramelize these and you know from being
quite bitter and boring um we've really
pimp this up you got the lovely smoked
paprika in there little brown sugar just
to caramelize it um and that I'm just
going to roast off in the oven now for
about 15 minutes and then we're going to
see the end result about 170Â° if you use
a fan assisted
oven so those are absolutely delicious
I'm just going to Plate those
up um and for my money I think that is
the best way of making cooking turnips
