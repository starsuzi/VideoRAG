hi and today we're going to be making a
bechamel sauce a white sauce now we need
flour whoops we just need a about three
teaspoons of flour just plain
flour now we also need an
onion now this is a variation that they
Us in some parts of the Mediterranean
grated onion but you can also do it
without yes and 3/4 of a liter of
milk you can use whole milk semis
skimmed or even
skimmed and we need butter to fry the
the onion
is I don't know what he's trying to tell
me here it looks like it has something
to do with a tennis match he was
watching this afternoon afternoon but
anyway we need salt and pepper and
finally some
nutmeg this is already grated but you
can use a nutmeg and and Grate it
yourself now we put the butter on in a
pan on the
heat until it's
melted don't put it on too high heat
because otherwise it may
burn and now when it's melted we grate
the onion
in make sure the heat's low on
this and now we've got the onion so we
stir it
round and we leave it on quite a low
heat stirring
it
we have the onion a nice golden color we
add 3 tpoon of plain
flour now we stir that in well the flour
has to
cook for a minute or
so and when that's cooked we start
adding the milk now as you can see we're
staring here with a with a whisk this is
a silicone covered whisk so you don't
scratch the bottom of your
pan so we add a little bit of milk
stirring all the
time now we stop adding the milk and we
stir and you see it thickens very
quickly it looks like it's going to get
lumpy but don't worry about that it's
just that there's a little flour there
and it's thickened
up so when we've got that all together
together we can add a little bit more
milk and repeat the same process stir in
the the thickened
flour you see it's all getting in there
nicely and we can add some more
milk
you whisk around there so that the
milk gets into the
sauce and when you can see it's not
quite so thick then you can you can add
more more milk s of in in a larger
quantity and when all the milk is added
we have to stir all the time until the
sauce thickens
and just before it's finished we add
some
salt
pepper and
finally we add some
nutmeg you have to keep stirring all the
time there's the
nutmeg you know when the white sauce is
done is that when you're stirring like
this you can actually see the bottom of
the
pan see you can see the bottom of the
pan and you know that that is actually
thick enough so you now have a white
sauce that can be used with numerous
recipes if you have any questions please
