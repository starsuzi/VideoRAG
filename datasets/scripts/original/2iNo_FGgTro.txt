hey guys Dave from cooking chair here
today's recipe
is Savory Italian sausage rice believe
me guys this is so good you're going to
love it so let's get
started I'm going to get started here by
adding some olive oil to a preheated
[Music]
pan then I'm going to slip my Italian
sausages in you can use any kind of
sausage you want as long as it's kind of
savory and zippy
and I'm going to fry these over medium
high heat for about 2 and 1/2 minutes on
each side but just make sure they're at
room
[Music]
temperature after about 5 minutes
they're nicely done so I'm just going to
cut them into bite-sized
[Music]
bits Now using the same pan I'm going to
add in half a chopped onion and two
cloves of
garlic followed by a chopped red bell
pepper five green beans that I've
chopped
up after that we're going to season this
with some salt and
pepper stir and fry for a minute or two
just so they start to get
[Music]
tender what you want to do now is add
your sausage back
in
[Music]
put the rice and pepper
in you can use basically any type of
rice in this
recipe and stir this around I'd say for
about a minute or so just so everything
is nicely
[Music]
coated next we're going to add in two
cups of chicken
stock bring it to a boil reduce the heat
to medium and allow it to simmer oh I'd
say for about 20
minutes this looks and smells absolutely
fantastic after about 20 minutes the
rice is nicely done so I'm going to add
in The
Parsley chopped green
onions tomatoes and I'm not going to
give you an amount here you can just
kind of do this according to your
taste grab my handy dandy wooden spoon
and just toss everything
[Music]
together and there you have it our
Savory Italian sausage
rice believe me guys this is simply out
