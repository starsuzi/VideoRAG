so it's like Friday
afternoon car need a good
wash as you can see a little bit
dirty hopefully it'll be slightly
cleaner in a
minute so I thought I'd come down and
get it washed and record that let's do
it bring it on
then the car gets soapy after being
sprayed oh yeah that's like a snow
machine working the old pressure washer
there sweet
Jesus look at the phone oh yeah so first
of all he sprays your wheels secondly he
sprays it with some sort of I don't know
wax or Tire remover or something I'm
being pressure washers now try to get
all the off the side of this car as
you've seen before I'm not sure what
pressure that's pumping out at but it's
pretty powerful by sounds
things vibrating the cart a
bit they're getting me a little bit soy
now that's the sure getting a bit soy in
here lots of soap going on
mhm getting the car all
slippy the next thing to do is they'll
give it a good sponge over over uh and
rub the soap on and try and get the
majority of the dirt off with a hand
with a hand sponge and then it will be
blasted again with the pressure washer
to rinse it off they'll squeegee
it uh as you can see he's rubbing it now
sheet and after that I'm going to hop
out so I'm going to have the inside hoid
as well and balance it inside so they
polish everything and it smells great
get a air freshener all that sort of
stuff even though I've already got one
so the pressure washing all the soap off
now all the
guys this is the time
okay so this is the end
result nice and clean in comparison to
how it
was much
better it's kobby Car
Wash got some air in the ties
now so overall I have to say I'm pretty
happy with the wash that I've received
from Corby hand car wash and uh thanks
for watching guys I'll see you later
