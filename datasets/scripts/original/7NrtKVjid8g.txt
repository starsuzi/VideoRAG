all right I showed you how to make your
own mustard your own ketchup your own
mayo and now it's time to make relish I
relish the thought of healthy condiments
boy that's bad anyway this is all you
need is a cucumber which is like 2 and
1/2 cups uh 1/3 a cup of apple cider
vinegar 3/4 of a teaspoon of Celtic Sea
salt and 1 tbspoon of marus sweet the uh
all zero calorie all healthy all natural
plant face sweetener it's the best uh
sugar substitute I can think of which is
why I made it it's what I use to sweeten
things won't get fat from
it doesn't raise insulin it's really
good for it anyway so here's how you
make your relish it's really easy you
just cut up your
cucumber into
pieces put it in the food processor
along with the sweetener the
salt and the one3 cup of apple cider
vinegar chop it into bits
cucumbers have a lot of water in them so
what you have right now is cucumber soup
basically so what you want to do is take
a
strainer and strain the water
out
[Music]
of course I suggest you drink this water
it's really good for you obviously it's
good K cucumbers are really good for the
kidneys they good for everything all
right so now that the uh water is
drained out of it you want to add a
little more apple cider vinegar to it to
make it that true condiment so like 1 to
two tablespoons of apple cider
vinegar
mix it
up and there you have your
relish that's definitely a relish you're
going to you're going to be amazed how
easy it is to make your
condiments this is relish it's so easy
like what it took me like what 90
seconds so look here you've got relish
mustard mayo and ketchup all made at
home with healthy ingredients there's no
excuse to not be healthy if all you're
going to eat as condiments if you're a
bachelor here you go it's easy and I'm
showing you how to do it see how fast
that was stay tuned for
