hi guys and this time I'm going to show
you how to make this really cool model
although it's not technically origami
it's a paper rose made from a napkin so
as you can see it looks very cool and
it's also very simple to make whether
you want to impress your girlfriend or
just to decorate the table it takes a
very little time so to start off grab a
regular napkin here I have a white one
and you want to take a one that has a
square shape because it's easier to fold
other than that you can take any color
and any size it doesn't really matter so
uh you want to unfold the
napkin and then you want to take the
upper side and fold it down about this
much okay so once you've done it turn it
to the side and start rolling the
[Music]
rows and you don't want to roll too
tight or too loose just like
this so once you've done it uh pinch the
paper uh where it is thicker or where
you've previously folded the paper
and then start very slowly twisting the
paper forming the
stem and you want to do it very slow
because it's very easy to rip the napkin
so and once you've finished the half of
the stem grab one layer of paper from
the bottom and pull it
upwards make sure not to rip the
napkin so uh you want to form a leaf and
then just continue twisting to the
[Music]
[Music]
bottom and once you finished it make
sure that the stem is very tight and
secure and you can do some additional
twisting you can already stop at this
point but to make it look better take a
rose and find the inner
layer and kind of do some
[Music]
twisting and you can also uh take the
paper and twist it
[Music]
outwards to make it look
[Music]
better but do it very carefully because
it's very easy to rip the
napkin okay so now your rose is
ready and that's it for the tutorial
