this is what I've done yesterday and it
once I dry it it going to looks like
that and don't be greedy when you dry it
keep enough space for them to go through
the Heat and dry it proper oh you be
wondering what's Nancy do with the tip
gone this is my own knife that I carry
everywhere in my kitchen to
cook and I love my
knife first thing you pick off the
top of the
[Music]
Fig you open it
up just look at that you open it up
look at that and I like it cut into half
and cut in the middle of
three so when
it
dry it would just have enough space to
breathe and the air can go through nice
and look at that
if you would want to put it on the
grill and and Grill it nicely with a
little a slitter of butter on it and one
is really Brown and tasty put a nice
piece of cheese on it you can have any
cheese you can have blue cheese you can
have soft cheese hot cheese just do that
and use it as a
starter and with making it as a starter
and if you want it a
bit um party then what you do you put a
little bit of lime on it on top of the
cheese
oh I have time for you if you watch me I
have time for you you see thank you for
watching me this is how I dry my
fake okay once you fill them all up
