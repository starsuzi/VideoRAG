[Applause]
hey what's up it's tony here uh this is
going to talk a little bit about the
woman bar or the tremolo or the floor
rose or whatever you want to call it i'm
going to show you a few tricks that i do
with it and as always at the end of the
video i'm going to show you a few licks
with this uh new technique involved so
yeah hope you like it
alright so the first thing that you have
to know about this lesson
is that you're gonna need the guitar
with a flattening brace like that one
like a floor rose or similar to that one
if you have a guitar like let's say a
fender strat or stuff like that
and the bridge can go you know up and
down then
you know it's on it's gotta work for
this lesson but it's much better one of
these at least for this kind of tricks
is much better floyd rose style of
bridge so
first thing i did on the beginning of
the video was a kind of harmonic
i do a lot or at least i did a lot back
in the days when i was some kind of a
rockstar or something like that but
anyway it's like
i take the third string here
now go down with the bar like
and i'm not i'm not doing you know
sometimes a lot of my students the
problem with this thing is that they
they are hitting the thread like
and you don't have to hit the thread
that first first thing have to say don't
hit the thread it's not like
[Music]
just it's like just hitting the open
string
okay
and now you go down with the bar
and now what you have to do is put the
finger the second or the third that's
the one i use uh on a harmonic and for
that you have to know the theory about
hermione's and the theory says that you
have arpeggio here that is like you have
the root on the fifth fret
minor third and four
then you have a fifth around the third
fret
you have the minor seven on the third
fret
you have the root again pretty much
where the point is here on the third
fret on the boot
and then if you i mean this one is
difficult but you can get the nine it's
pretty much on the second fret
[Music]
okay that one is very difficult and if
you have low action
it's going to be even more difficult
because the action helps you for
uh
you know making fast runs and peaking
and it's more kind of a technical setup
for the guitar but if you want to do
some
her money treats with that the wall
action is not going to help you but
anyway
so what you have to do is go down with
the bar
[Music]
and now when the when the bar is down is
where you put the finger like
really slow is
[Music]
[Applause]
now what you can do here is you can go
faster like
or even faster if you don't want to if
you don't want to hurt the the string
going down like
you don't want that you can make
like
and put the finger just uh
pretty fast that's what you have to do
so
a good exercise to practice this is just
go for every note you have here like the
rule third fifth so let's go for it you
have to root
the third
[Applause]
[Music]
and now as i said i don't think i'm
gonna get it but you have the nine let's
try it
okay i was lucky but anyway that one is
very difficult but you can try
and that's the thing with harmonies now
the thing is that a lot of people are
getting a lot of background knowledge to
say that way or some way
and that's because when you're hitting
street down you have nothing here i mean
and that's what you think what you get
it's like all the background you have
distortion on the end and everything so
what you need here or what i do i put my
thumb my right hand thumb here or the
first i mean on the fourth fifth and
sixth string so i'm muting this one and
my left hand is muting
all the rest of streams so
[Music]
only the third is is ringing to say that
way so when i'm making a harmonic
i can say it's pretty clean and it's
because of that okay because i'm muting
pretty much everything now a lot of
people uh
when do when you do a hermit like that
it's just something like
you know it needs a mess you don't want
that you want to be as clean as possible
so
advice for you take a look to uh mathias
eklund i think is the name i don't know
how to pronounce it but anyway mathias
and he's awesome making her money she's
the i think he's the best one in the
world making this kind of stuff
okay so the second thing i want to show
you here is uh
two things actually or two one intrigue
that steve vibe does a lot and not only
divide but you know
he's using the bar a lot these days so
anyway first one is called i think it's
called the gargle or something like that
i'm not sure about this in english but
anyway it's just uh making the note
and now you put the bar like that and
you hit it
[Music]
so it's not very difficult but if you
don't have like a floyd rose you're not
going to get this kind of sound because
you need a flight in bridge for that
there's the first one and it's very easy
so you don't need more info about it
just hit the the warming bar like that
and you're gonna get this kind of you
make it with no um
with the guitar uh not plugging you get
this you can hear the floyd bridge
moving
okay so that the first thing and the
second one is making like scale and
going up and down with the bridge a
little bit where you're moving between
the notes
like let's say i'm gonna play uh g major
for instance okay so i'm making like
[Music]
[Applause]
the thing here is that you play note
when you play the next one
um just one second after playing it just
go down a little bit with the bar and
you get this kind of uh emotional thing
like
[Music]
like
so you play the note and then you play
the bar like
[Applause]
[Music]
that's pretty much it
okay so the last thing i'm going to show
you is the jetpack style of one bar
tricks or melodies or whatever you want
to call it and the trick is
i play a lot of natural harmonies
and i go i move the whammy bar to get to
the exact note i want
because
let's say i'm going to play g and a for
instance i'm going to play something
like
dna okay i know if you know the
harmonics or the theory about that you
have a g here
and you have an a here
but as you can hear there's a lot of
difference you cannot make a melody like
that you need the note to be closer so
what i do is i pull out the one bar
plate
[Music]
and the difficult thing here or
difficult part is to get in tune because
you know it's difficult to go to the
node that
you don't have afraid to
to pick so it's like
cool thing just try uh trust your ears
that's
i mean after a few days of practicing
and everything you get uh closer to the
okay i'm gonna pull just a whole step or
a how stay with the movie bar up and
down and you get used to that to your
walleye bar if you change the guitar um
then it gets like maybe
maybe an hour or so to get used again
but it's not that difficult so to
practice this what you have to do is
play a normal line
with no harmonics like the line i play
in the beginning of the video it was
something like uh i think it was
something like that
[Music]
yeah something like that pretty much so
what i do is i i try to find out where
the harmonics are like the first part of
the league is really easy because it
goes like this
now i want this note
so what i do is i pull up my butt
so difficult part here again getting
tuned and if you want to
have some vibrato it's even more
difficult because you have to uh make
the vibrato with the you know getting
the tremolo up on the nose so it's not
easy but
but again a few days of practicing and
you get it
so what you can do after that is just
try to
change the ending of the league or
wherever like let's say
for instance so beginning is the same so
but now i want this note
so i know here you have a g
and it's a half is a half step down so
there it is so you have
uh
[Applause]
[Music]
so that's the thing just practice that
and you're gonna get it so now i'm gonna
play a few leagues for you uh
with this jeff becky style and somebody
style and some
more stuff and yeah i hope you enjoyed
this lesson
and
let's do the leagues
[Music]
okay so here's the first league as you
can hear is pretty much in the sleep by
style so
um it's not difficult but again you have
to play in love with the white bar to
get
musical because you don't want to get
crazy and get out of tune all the time
so what i did here slow down it's a knee
with your money
okay so i just put my finger there
and now the line goes like this is
[Music]
so the lining is not difficult but i
play the guava bar a little bit when i
arrive to the next node or to a new node
so it's like
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
now as you can hear the last note i do
this lower to to make it even more
interesting to say that right so
[Music]
so slow down
[Music]
a little bit up to speed
[Music]
okay so the second link is based around
the jetpack style game but this time
he's based on the change that he use a
lot
trying to uh emulate a slide guitar so
right through here is pretty much i do
i start with a and i play a triad here
but i do like that
what you have to do is just play the
note
but before playing the note just go down
with the with the bar a little bit like
that so you get this
[Music]
it's like making um
like making the bending from
here but
okay so
[Music]
[Applause]
you can play the more rocky style like
or just more softly like
[Music]
i now play this one
and then
down
so together songs like this
[Music]
okay so this last league is based around
the age again
a blues to say like that what i do first
i play a
line like the first week of bye
[Music]
and now play again with her money so i
have the root
at the major third
yeah
i wanna do is let ring the third so
[Music]
so i have this kind of a annoying sound
that i like because the major third and
the four is uh so close or not and you
have just a half step between one and
the other that you get this kind of a
disgusting sound like matias
that's a lot like for instance
[Music]
play a note with harmonic and then a
normal one like here that win g
and i'm playing half step down
something like that but anyway in this
league i'm playing just the third and
fourth so
[Applause]
okay
but i like more with hermione so
and then i play the minor 7 here
[Applause]
[Music]
that's the league so slow down and
together it sounds like this
[Music]
[Applause]
okay so i hope you like this little
lesson about the woman's reads and the
one part of the lines and everything
and how you create your own uh with your
travel and stuff like that you can warm
a lot with it instead of going crazy up
and down
and uh yeah hope to see you next week
