hello ladies and gents and welcome back
to my channel so today I'm going to be
teaching you how to do rice and peas
very easy very simple perfect recipe if
you follow it right so I'm going to be
using a quarter of a pack of red kidney
beans so this is the brand that I use
it's the island Sun by in tesos but I'm
sure you can find this or another brand
in your local off license or somewhere
um I don't use the tinned one that's
already been cooked I prefer to start
from
strap I'm just going to put in a quarter
pack
if you're not a big fan of kidney beans
then you can use less in your pot it's
up to you but this is roughly how much
so I'm going to just wash these and then
I'm going to come back and put some
water in the pot to start
off okay so I've washed my peas now as
you can see um whil you've got your
water in the pot and washing your peas
if there are any that float to the top
that means means that they're not good
so just take them out and get rid of
them all right then so now I'm going to
add some water to my
[Applause]
peas I'm just going to be using pint
glasses so we're going to add around
three pint glasses of water
so that's three PL glasses of water that
I've added um in my Bowl here I've got
eight pimento seeds and two two cloves
of garlic that I'm just going to put in
there and that's for the initial cooking
of
the
peas I'm going to
add 2 teaspoons of salt two level
teaspoons not too
much as you get used to cooking your
peas you'll be able to smell when you've
got enough salt in your pot if not when
you're nearly finished cooking the peas
and you're ready to season your pot then
you can just add more salt if you're not
happy with the amount of salt that
you've got in there it's totally up to
you some people cook with more some
people cook with
less so I'm going to add a bit of black
pepper
now add around 3/4 of a spoon of black
pepper and
then it's going to turn on my
stove cover my pot and then leave my
peas to start cooking
and then once the piece have cooked I'll
be back to show you how to season the
pot and then get back in with your rice
but for now as your peas are cooking you
can just test it and see if it's ready
to be seasoned so all you do is just
pick up a grave of peas on the spoon and
just squeeze it if it's going soft then
you know that it's time for you to
seasoning your pot if not then it needs
and it's still really hard then it needs
to be cooked for a bit
longer this um piece can take a while to
cook can take up to an hour probably
even more so it just depends okay so
I'll be back when this is nearly
done hey guys so I've been cooking my
pieas for about 35 minutes now I'm just
going to open the PO check on the piece
and see how far along it's
gone so I can see here that the water's
gone down quite a bit and the peas
aren't quite ready yet I'm just going to
take out a few to just show you what
they look like after 35 minutes of
cooking so that is what they look like
can see if I squeeze one it's quite hard
still so that's not fully cooked yet
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add
about 2 more P glasses of cold water to
this and the reason why I add cold water
is so that I sink the peas which means
that they go down into the water and
cook rather than being at the top of the
water not fully cooking so I'm going to
add two more Pine glasses of cold
[Applause]
water so that's
one so as you can see there the peas
have gone down to the bottom since I've
added the cold water in
[Applause]
and
two so I'm going to leave this for a
further 20 minutes to just cook for a
bit longer and then check if the peas
are ready to be seasoned yet if not then
we're going to continue to cook for
longer and then I'll see you guys in a
bit okay so it's been another half an
hour now and my peie should be cooked so
I'm just going to check it out make sure
that it's cooked so I can
season I just picked up two grains there
as you can see and
yep that's cooked cuz it's soft now I
can squish it with my
finger so what I'm going to do
now is I'm going to add in
some
time fresh time I got from my garden and
grow your own time I believe you can buy
them in the supermarket or your local
Marketplace should sell them and um yeah
you can just either keep them on your
window sill or you can put it out plant
it outside it's up to
you what I'm doing is I'm taking out the
old garlic that I've had cooking in the
pot from the beginning because I don't
want my garlic to mush out into my rice
and peas so I'm just going to throw
these
away and I'm going to put in two new two
new cloes of
garlic I've got some skell in
here that I've washed and I've just used
the end of the knife to just flatten a
bit I'm also going to put in one scotch
on it pepp
PE so I've just washed my Scotch Bonet
pepper here I've got a yellow one I
usually use green but yellow is okay if
you don't have green so I'm just going
to throw the entire pepper in there with
the stem and
everything and then I'm going to get my
coconut milk I Ed this
one the Tropical Sun and I use a small
tins cuz you can just use it in one go
and then you get your dinner done and
that's it cuz sometimes when we use the
big tin we have to keep it in our fridge
in a container and it's not going to
last until the next week so I'm just
going to open my tin and then empty it
out into the pot
just empty out this tin of coconut milk
into the C
[Music]
okay so once that's all done we just
going to leave
it going to leave it to cook in for a
bit cuz your is now
seasoned and then you're going
to prepare your rice to put in your pot
after
this so see you on the other
side okay so my piece is seasoned in now
and it's ready to go so I've gone ahead
and I've measured out my rice I've got
630 G here so I'm just going to pour
this out into my strainer or Si whatever
you call
it and then I'm just going to use this
to wash my
rice just going to wash the rice
properly and I use the Sie so that I
make sure anything that's coming out of
the rice that I didn't when there comes
out
properly and also it drains off the
excess water that you don't need in your
pot cuz adding too much water obviously
you will turn your rice into to
something else
so this makes it accurate just's wash
your
eyes just going to run it under the
water for a couple of
minutes and just get it done
if you've got a slightly bigger strainer
just use it my one's not too too big so
as you can see a few bits of few of my
rice screens have come out but that's
all right no big deal all right so I'm
satisfied with how my rice is washed now
so I'm just going to get the excess
water out
and then just leave it to drain in the
bowl while I sort out my
peas okay so I've got my wash D here by
my pot and as you can see the seasonings
cooked in
nicely got your scotch Bonet pepper
there let cook down but it's still got
the stem in inside so it's not
burst the
skeleion and then the th is now cooked
out into the pot so you got the time
leaves and then you've
got this
stick and then the water is nice and
red good color so your R and piece can
come out how it
should all right so the this water has
drained out the rice now so I'm just
going to empty that out into the pot and
use a fork to do it now
right so all my rice is in there now I'm
just going to mix it
in and make sure I incorporate
everything
properly since that's all mixed in I'm
going to add a bit more water to it you
can add cold water or you can add warm
water I've got a bit of warm water in my
kettle
from my meat that I'm cooking today with
my rice and peas so I'm just going to
use the warm water that I've got and
just top it
up I'm going go ahead again get my fork
and just get that mixed in
this I'm going to leave on a low heat a
very low heat to just steam through and
cook properly I don't want it to burn at
the bottom and then the middle of the
rice isn't cooked or anything like that
so I'm just going to leave it on a low
heat and let it do its thing and I'm
going to cover it with some f
paper I put my pot cover back over it
and then I'm going to check on it in
about 15 minutes and then if it needs
more water and add a tiny bit at a time
and just let it cook because you don't
want to add too much water in there the
last thing you want is to cook your
pieas nicely and everything and then
your rice spoil because you put too much
water in there in the end so just add it
gradually and if you need more you just
stop up as you go
along okay so it's been around 15
minutes now I'm going to just checking
on my rice and peas see if I need to add
any more water see if it's already
cooked or if it needs to cook a bit more
long so as you can see the rice grains
are still quite
thin and I would I would want them to be
cooked a little bit
more tiny bit more
water put back on my f paper and leave
it
for another 10 15
minutes so it's a little bit of water
not too
much back on my
fur back on my
lid and then another 10 to 15 minutes it
should be ready and then I'll show you
my end
result so I've the rice about 15 minutes
now I'm just going to check on
it so that seems to me like it's cooked
perfectly what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take out the seasonings and put
them on top of my foil
just going to turn it around there so
you can see exactly what I'm
doing there we go taking out all of
the pment seeds the sticks from the
time the skeleion and everything else
cuz we're not going to eat
this and just take of any excess rice if
you can't then it's not a big deal you
won't die if you lose a b
rice so as you can see I'm just taking
out the seasonings and just putting them
on my f I'm going to look for my eight
Pento seeds
the reason why I count them when I'm
putting them in is because it's very
unpleasant if you bite into one of them
while you're eating so I make sure I
know exactly how many I put in so I can
take them out when I finished cooking my
rice one more M there so that's
two and
three some SK here
another pental
seed so I've got half of my pental seeds
out
now another one here
five so I'm just going to just dig
around a little bit and try and
find the rest of them
so the rice is nice and fluffy and light
it's not too heavy and study that's what
you're looking
for
six so I need to find two more per of
seeds this one here so that's
seven and then I've got one more to find
just going to go
[Music]
here little bit of SK
in last pental seed is hiding from me
right just pral seed is hiding very well
so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to try and find it when I'm serving up
my dinner instead of playing the rice
all
day
because it might take a while to find
it all right guys so this is how I made
my rice and peas hope you enjoyed it
hope you find it interesting and easy to
do and I'll see you guys soon bye
