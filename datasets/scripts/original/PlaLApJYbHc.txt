Hey guys! Today I will make beautiful phone cases with pressed flower.
It is not that easy,
but you can do this with my tutorial.
There are also tutorials about pressing flower in 3 different ways.
First, we need flower, bulky books, scissors, tweezers,
thin wood stick, resin, and phone case.
And optionally, iron or microwave can be needed for pressing flower.
Before making phone cases,
let’s find out how to press flowers.
The first way is using bulky books.
Prepare some flowers,
and pulling petals off.
And put them in the book.
After 24 hour or more,
you can get pressed flower.
The second way is using iron.
Put flowers between clean papers,
and iron them with low heat.
The third way is using microwave.
Put a dish, tracing paper on it, and flower, again put tracing paper
After that,
press them with a flat and having weight thing.
I used a soup bowl.
After heating them 2-3minutes,
you can get pressed flower which color is little bit changed.
Left side is pressed flower using iron,
and right is using microwave.
Now, let’s make phone case.
Before sticking flowers to phone case,
you should draw design.
Cause modifying after sticking them is really difficult.
After deciding your own design,
stick flowers with glue.
You don’t have to cover whole petals,
because it is just for fix the location of petals.
Next, prepare resin.
I used Crystal resin.
If you don’t want to buy it,
you can cover the phone case with nail polish,
but I recommend using resin.
It can keep the beautiful color of flowers better.
Pour and spread the resin.
After waiting more than a day,
the resin had set hard.
Removing some stuck out resin with cutter,
it was the hardest step for me. :(
And then, it’s done!
I made another one with other kind of flower.
It was not that easy challenge,
but it was really fun and
I love both phone cases sooo much.
If you enjoy it,
please give me thumbs up and subscribe fingur.
I really thank you for watching
and hope to see you again.
Bye!
