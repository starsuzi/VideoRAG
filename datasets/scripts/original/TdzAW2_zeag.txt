all right so I wanted to do another
quick review of some products for you so
we usually use Stevia to sweeten most of
uh whatever we're eating or drinking
that's going to be sweet sometimes we'll
use things like coconut sugar or agave
but for coffees and beverages we usually
use Stevia so I have a few different
products here that I want to just
highlight for you folks today and the
first one is this
this is called sweet drops by Sweet Leaf
and this one is vanilla cream flavored
and it's really nice because it comes
with the little dropper right in there
and very strong so um I had a cup of
coffee today I'll show you what size
this size I put 10 drops of this in my
cup of coffee this morning with some
cream and it was really strong so that
might have been a little bit too much
it says it has 288 servings in it and
for ingredients it has purified water
organic Stevia leaf extract natural
flavors and vanilla extract so not a
whole lot of extra ingredients in there
it's very shelf stable this is 12 18
this will expire and I really like this
product it's delicious and it adds that
extra little bit of sweetness to your
coffee in the mornings if you need that
without the extra calories or refined
sugar also really great if you carbonate
water we have a SodaStream we just used
to carbonate water and then we'll put a
couple drops of something like this in
it and it makes like a little vanilla
cream soda great for the kids as a
compromise as well
so the next one that I have tried and
wanted to show you guys this one is by
the now brand and it is hazelnut
flavored it's called better Stevia
liquid sweetener again just a few
ingredients vegetable glycerin natural
hazelnut flavor that was put into an
alcohol base and certified organic
stevia extract so this isn't organic in
its entirety however the stevia that's
in it is this one just has a little flip
top
and a little dropper in the top like
that
also very delicious and I like that this
has a nice intense hazelnut flavor to it
and isn't just sickly sweet
so I bought those two at a health food
store I'm also going to put a link for
Amazon if you wanted to purchase those
they're about the same price sometimes a
little bit cheaper actually from Amazon
and again if you live in a small area
like me and you can't get out of town to
go to a health food store or something
like that at your house in two days it's
fantastic
so the next one that I want to show you
guys the SE two I actually went to
Walmart and I just decided to see what
these were about so I picked these up
they're very inexpensive
um these ran I think about three to four
dollars a piece the other two are
anywhere from like seven to ten so these
are about half the price however
um this has water
erythritol Stevia natural flavors malic
acid sodium benzoate and potassium
sorbate
so these have some preservatives added
to them and they also have the
erythritol so this one has about the
same thing water erythritol stevia
extract natural flavors malic acid
sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate in
it as well so these do have some added
preservatives but if you're looking at
whether or not to use these or like
aspartame or sucralose
um something like that
um you you kind of have to you know
weigh your evils for that
um but these are more readily available
the only thing is I these had kind of a
stronger aftertaste when I tried them
than the other two that I have been
using and they have this little like
squeeze top to them which I found you
kind of get an excessive amount the
other thing is that these were more
inexpensive however this is 1.68 fluid
ounces and it's only 160 servings so if
you're comparing this one claims that
have 288 servings this one has 160. so
for price you know you kind of if you
want to pay a little bit more it's a
little bit more front loaded but this is
a better quality it has much better
flavor to it less of an aftertaste it's
more of a convenience factor if you need
to pick these two things up I'm going to
steer away from these personally just
because of the added potassium sorbate
malic acid and the sodium events away
personally
so let me show you guys just kind of
what I do with these so I have um these
are some coffees that I'm making for
today so what I do with this type of
thing is I just grab
a couple drops
and I'm just gonna do
two three four five let's try five in it
today and give that a try
and my milk is non-homogenized so I'm
gonna shake that up a little bit
and pour a little in there and give it a
try so this one is the vanilla and I
just took some shots of espresso we have
an espresso maker here but you could do
this with like a cold brew or something
like that just a little bit of ice and
the coffee if you do a cold brew like in
your fridge and then a few drops of that
a little bit more
so five drops is not quite enough so
maybe 10 for this too
but it is really strong and you can see
the drops are pretty small
let's mix that up
much better
um
and it makes just like a nice little
summer treat I'm gonna do the same with
this and let's just see how many drops
of that for this size glass this one's
gonna have just a little bit more milk
so it might not need quite as much
so
and as you can see those drops are a lot
thicker
stir that up the hair
smells delicious
and these come in all different flavors
so you can get them in like root beer
flavors so if you do have a soda stream
you can mix root beer flavoring into it
and make a little treat for the kids
like that
and that one is really really good like
that
very delicious
all right guys
um so that's my review on these Brands
so again this is now better Stevia Sweet
Leaf sweet drops and then
skinny girl and great value that you can
purchase at Walmart
so let me know what you thought of this
review if it was helpful if there's
something else that you want me to
highlight or if you have any ideas for
me for the future thank you for watching
and I'll see you next time
