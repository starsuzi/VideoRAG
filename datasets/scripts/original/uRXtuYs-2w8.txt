thank you
hey welcome to your backyard my YouTube
channel
today's video I want to tell you about
an amazing pine tree Conifer called the
Norfolk pine very common to the coastal
area of Central Florida where I live
and also throughout the world an
Australia New Zealand Etc
it is a gigantic tree and I'm going to
show you an example of different stages
of growth this particular tree I'm going
to park right now that has a great
number of them this particular tree is
extremely old and sampling how
absolutely gigantic it can get you get
hurricanes here and the winds batter
the branches and you can see it's taken
some of use over the years but it always
comes back
this tree has withstood 80 to 100 mile
an hour winds over and over and over and
still standing
it would stand salt spray the only thing
it really doesn't want to withstand is
really cold temperatures of course the
soil here is very Sandy and I think it
favors that
this tree originates from Norfolk
Islands which is in between Australia
and New Zealand
and I believe it was discovered in the
1800s by Europeans I'm probably wrong
there but anyway
it's just a really distinctive looking
tree but the closest thing to a
Christmas tree shape that we're going to
get around here in Florida
now this is not the kind of tree you
want to plant right next to your house
at least another country I'd want to
plant right next to my house
yeah here's an example of a very young
Norfolk pine probably about three or
four years old you can see it's being
allowed to grow as a multi-trunk that's
another interesting feature of this tree
is you can grow it in multiple trunks
I'd recommend not doing that you use one
trunk I think it looks a lot better and
you don't have the branches from the two
trunks banging together so
for me I I wouldn't choose to go that
route I don't know if we'll continue
that here in this park but
you can see it's just a beautiful tree
requires very little fertilization grows
well in Sandy soils
very unique short
pine needles on this
tree as well
if you think of planting a Norfolk pine
in your yard here's another thing you
should probably consider
you're not a deal breaker but in my mind
something well worth considering
and that is that it drops a lot of
these
so
probably mow them up but at some point
they start to kill the grass and
they don't disintegrate necessarily that
easily another thing that it does later
in the season is drop a lot of small
pine cones
just something to be aware of
