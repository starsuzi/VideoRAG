I'm here today to show you my beautiful garden
and how many bugs we have. What happened was we had
a rain a few days ago - very likely the last one in the early season here
in Sacramento -
and I intentionally haven't put any,
any kind of any thing on it to get rid of the bugs
because (no, I'm not being lazy) it's for
scientific reasons. We are
going to decide which we like better: our homemade
insect repellent, or if we're going to have to resort to a natural
insecticide. Since I don't really want a whole lot of
dead things in my garden right now,
we're going to start with this. This is
Thai chili peppers,
garlic, vinegar, and
water. (My onions smell
awesome.)
What we did was, we stuck it all in a blender, you just fill your blender up
 
with Thai chili peppers and garlic, and pour in
some vinegar and some filtered water
(because it's the calcium that causes problems,
not the water). We blended it all up really well,
pureed it to this liquid goo, and then we filtered it, because
believe me, you do not want that stuff in
your spray nozzle
(it won't work). And this is what we got.
And then what we are going to do
is I'm just going to go spray all my leaves through my garden, and
come back...
Oh, yes! Because this stuff is made with peppers and garlic and vinegar,
it smells like the most
wonderful Italian food ever. So it's not,
not bad. So I'm going to spray this around, and we'll get everything going,
see how it works.
It's not just that I don't want a lot of dead things in my garden, 'cause really, I don't; but I've also got a lot of
birds that actually depend on my garden for their little, little critters that
that they like to eat, so
I didn't want to deprive them of that, or feed them poison as well.
And now the artichokes and mint.
We'll check back in a few minutes and see how it worked.
Okay, so it's been a few minutes
 
and it works okay. One of the things that we noticed when I
started spraying in here is a whole bunch of aphids just took flight and landed off,
and when I came in to do a second spraying a few minutes later,
there wasn't nearly as many. And also my
artichoke and my mint usually have a nice bunch
of ants all over it (and I'm not a big fan of ants, but,
you know, whatever), they're not there anymore. So,
they work, they work okay; it smells awesome.
And then I've got most of the - Actually, there's not as many
flies, either. So it works okay, but it's not going to get rid of everything,
so there we are.
Another thing that I noticed not long after I finished spraying is, on my
artichoke
we found an actual
horse fly, which I've only seen one other time in my whole life living in
Sacramento,
and it looked like he was drinking the
insect spray, so
I don't know... They live on horses.
And remember: That which does not kill
you
is coming back with friends!
