all right hul Maniacs we got part two of
the video now we got Hulk all taped
down which is uh pretty common
occurrence for him I can imagine so he's
taped up you can see most of what's
going on through him now what you want
to do is basically get that tape stuck
to him as much as you possibly can this
thing
easy tool right here just roll over it
apply a little pressure roll him
down give him his
massage he just had that big match
against
Randy
Savage Georgia animal steel came out and
joined
in ate one of those uh corner post
cushion things
Jean just lost his mind all right basic
roll down there he's stuck now Loom tool
once again good thing everything uh is
pretty much rolled down now you just
take the edge of this and just rub it a
little bit if you rub it you'll see
individual beads kind of stand
out on the board and that's what you
want to do is you want to get it
particularly the edges just rub it down
not too hard don't push the beads off
but
but give it a rub down come around the
corners you can see the bead start to
stand out as you rub
it go around those
edges I'll give this a little bit more
rub down after the video I like to make
sure everything's absolutely stuck now
this is the thing that they do not show
you when you watch other tutorial videos
cuz why do you have that crazy loom tool
well here's why when you have a masking
tape perer creation this tape right now
is forming a seal it is making little
air pocket bubbles when you start to
iron it down those things will not seal
we'll get some examples of how bad it
looks if you don't do this thing so take
a loom tool poke poke poke poke you get
in between that's okay poke poke poke
poke poke poke this is a lot like
like popping bubble
wrap just go at it you can do it on the
board what I prefer to do this guy's
pretty much on there now let's give them
a little bit of a press what I prefer to
do is take them off the board put them
on something nice and
soft
and put the holes on that
this is just a dollar store little car
towel shammy sham wow knockoff ripoff
whatever just pull him off of here at
this point he's stuck he ain't going
nowhere you might get a couple beads
coming off the board when you do this
it's not a disaster if it
does cuz the tape is sticking you can
just put them back
on
o just do it carefully here
there he
comes oh that last little piece of tape
the bigger they are the harder they fall
they'll tell you that in wrestling every
time
okay let's get them up off
there up off the
board and there we
are Hulk Hogan's all taped
down now what I should have done is laid
him down flat but I lost a couple beads
so that's uh that's getting them off the
board we'll have him laid down flat next
video you're going to see them all poked
up in the back now if you do end up
losing a couple beads just get your
tweezers and just push that bad boy back
down on there in fact you may want to go
over go over the outline go over the
inside make sure everything's good you
can pull the beads off you can put them
back on like you can just take this one
one right here say I don't like the way
that looks pick it off then push it back
down all right part three we're going to
have them all poked up and we'll start
doing some ironing so tune in for that
video
