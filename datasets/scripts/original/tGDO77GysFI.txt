good morning and it's cold in
Sacramento my name is Frenchy
with the French Connection Plumbing
okay today I'm going to give you a
little tip on how to unclog your garbage
disposal remember garbage disposal is
not a garbage can
so if you put fiber food or grease fat
and oil it will eventually clog it is
just a unit for the water for the
dishwasher can go through it and grind
whatever needs to be done
so if you are clogging the garbage
disposal a little key like this comes with
it go on the bottom of the garbage
disposal in the center of it put that
key inside of it and just go ahead and
turn it counterclockwise many times and
clockwise many times and it should free any
debris that clogged it and also in the
center of that hole there is also a
reset button that's red to reset the disposal
in case of humming when it hums like
that sometimes it is freezing its frozen
so that will also release the motor that
will save you about $125 for a plumber to
come over and do exactly the same thing
run a lot of hot water run a lot of cold
water and remember avoid fiber food
greasy food egg shells coffee ground and you
should not have a problem thank you
