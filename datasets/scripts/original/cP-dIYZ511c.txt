I just woke
up had a
good 12h hour
sleep feels
good um what do I need for
breakfast
well firstly I don't really eat
breakfast very early I uh start the day
with uh maybe a liter of water just
normal water just to hydrate after a
long nights
sleep
um rehydrate the
body um and it just feels good to drink
water first to drink water first thing
in the
morning then I follow up with the
coconut
ultimate
breakfast which of course is food
there's sugar in there and technically
it it's it's eating rather than
drinking but I still feel like it goes
down really well just a nice coconut in
the morning and then usually it goes
about takes about one or even two hours
before I really eat
anything after sleeping for a long time
your digestive system shuts down more or
less and your whole body goes into a
rest restful
mode so I feel like when we wake up it
takes a little bit of time for the
different organs to sort of activate and
really get
started
so after I started listening to my body
rather than just shoving food in my
mouth because it's that time of day
after I started listening to my body I
realized is that I don't really want to
eat
anything immediately when I wake up I
used to just wake up eat go to school or
go to work or something like that I
think that's what a lot of people
do but now I feel very different about
it I I wake up and I don't feel like
eating at all for a few hours
usually much rather just take it easy
drink some water have a
coconut when I feel like it do some
exercise and then after an hour or
two I can really feel like yeah now I
want to eat and I'm hungry and that's
that's and then it feels way better to
eat then because you can really digest
it properly rather than just shocking
your digestive system first thing in the
morning you know
we just need to listen to our bodies
that's all there's no
rules you feel like eating first thing
in the
morning maybe that'll work for you but
listen to your body try
and figure out what you really want
because a lot of the time we just follow
habits we just do things out of habit
because it's that time day well I'm
going to work I have to eat or things
like that try
to take a step back from all that and
just um try to be aware of subtle
signals that the body is giving you at
different times of the day and one of
those signals for me is that when I wake
up in the morning I'm not hungry I'm
just thirsty usually a little bit so I
just
drink water have a coconut take it
easy enjoy the morning because the
morning hours are
special
quiet all right thanks a lot for
watching hope you have a nice day
Wherever You Are
I'm going to go out and hunt for some
mangoes
um I'm pretty sure I'll find some good
ones from here in Thailand so should be
pretty
good all right peace and love
