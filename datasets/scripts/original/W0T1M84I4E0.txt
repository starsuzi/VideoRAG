this is chris the idaho painter in this
video i got a simple tip when it comes
to installing interior trim and crown
molding and that's gluing your seams
instead of nailing them so stay tuned
for this video
so i do own a painting company b and k
painting and it is a full-service
painting company and what that
full-service painting company means is
we do all of our own drywall repairs and
carpentry repairs and the carbon repairs
on the exterior of the house doing
siding repairs and trim repairs and on
the inside of the house we do a lot of
carpentry repairs when it comes to
interior trim and crown molding so we
remove old bad banged up stuff beat up
stuff and we also install new stuff and
there's a simple trick when it comes to
butting two seams together how you
actually go about doing that and i've
learned a whole lot from my friend
richard from dfw crown watching his
videos on youtube and him helping me out
and he's got a simple tip of how you
create a joint a real solid joint
without nailing it and this is a really
good trick because it got some cabinets
in my house where a previous
carpenter actually installed the crown
molding on the cabinets and damaged the
crown really bad by trying to staple the
seams together and i'll show you what
that actually looks like and richard has
this really cool trick of gluing the
seams together and getting a glued scene
to stick extremely fast and extremely
strong strong so stay tuned for this
trick right now
so hopefully you can see this is my
kitchen cabinets right here they were
installing the crowd molding right here
and they tried to shoot pens in it and
it actually busted it right here this is
dark cause we actually stained it to
just try to give it an antique look but
they stapled it right there and it
busted off a piece of the crown right
there and it's actually not held
together and it's got to be repaired
that's what you call some bad carpentry
work so we got another look at a crown
seam right here and it's been
shot and nailed right there which
because of the holes we had to putty it
and instead of shooting pins like that
it's a lot better to actually glue it so
you don't actually have those nail holes
that got to be filled even if it's going
to be painted way better to glue it so
watch this trick glowing crown
hey thanks a lot chris for having me on
the channel i really appreciate it i've
been watching your videos for about five
or six years now learned a lot of stuff
i got a real quick tip today for
everyone out there and that's how i glue
up my trim the way i do that is i use
cyan acrylic glue and the short term is
ca glue it's a two part glue with the
glue itself and an activator and what
i've got right here behind me
is a outside corner for crown molding
and i need to do a return because the
ceiling drops off
so instead of having to hold all those
pieces up there
and nail them in place this signer
acolyte glue really helps me get that
done and i'll show you right here how to
use it so here's the pieces that i need
to glue up this is the return i've
already glued this together and
just trying to break it apart
is very hard
i can't do it
so the glue works great
this is the return the end cap
then it'll hook to my short run i'll
glue it to that and then i'll glue that
to my long run this outside 45
so first thing i'm going to do
is take that ca glue the glue itself and
i'll run
a small bead down the middle that way if
there's any squeeze out
it will be limited
and then i'll take and always going to
start with my short pieces first rather
than my big long one so i'll take that
and now here's what i do people do this
differently
but i'll actually activate the beat the
bead now some people like to activate
the mating side
i just
like to do it this way i think it works
better
then you'll just spray that on there
and a chemical reaction takes place
where it starts to dry instantly hence
the name insta-cure
and that is no joke
i mean that's already
just like that
it's about eight seconds they say and it
usually doesn't even take that long
so i'll go ahead and glue this one on
here
and then we'll be ready to install this
piece of crown
it's important to move quick because you
don't have much time
and we are good to go with that
and just like that
i mean i can actually just hold this out
and it's not gonna fall on me
so this works awesome we use this stuff
all the time if you've ever watched my
channel dfw crown you know i use this
stuff all the time
so i will go ahead and install this
piece and i'll show you that right now
so we went ahead and tacked up that
corner over there and we did that off
camera just so we could get that corner
right so
what we'll do here now is just we'll
push this up into place
like that
and all we got to do now is just install
it we use a 18 gauge brad nail and we
shoot in a v pattern
and that's how easy that is to install
an outside corner and you see the
benefits of that glue
