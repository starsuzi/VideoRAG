Hello and welcome to Videojug.
We're going to show you how to make traditional
yYorkshire pudding.
You'll need these ingredients to serve four
to six people: a 115 grams of plain flour,
3 eggs, 275 ml of milk, 150 ml of vegetable
oil and salt.
And these are the utensils required: a bowl,
a sieve, a whisk or electric hand whisk, a
solid roasting tin approximately 30 centimetres
by 20 centimetres.
Step one.
Start straightaway by putting the vegetable
oil in the roasting tin.
It should cover the bottom of the tin.
You need to heat the oil before adding the
pudding mixture.
If you are also making a roast beef, then
your oven will already be hot.
If not, the temperature needs to be set to
220 degrees Centigrade or gas mark 7.
Step two.
Now, gently sift the flour into the bowl.
Once completed, make a well in the center
for the eggs to go.
Step three.
Now, break the eggs one by one, directly into
the well.
Start beating the two ingredients together,
slowly incorporating the flour into the egg.
Step four.
Next, add the milk and a generous pinch of
salt.
And continue beating until the smooth butter
is formed.
You could either use an electric hand whisk
to speed up the process.
Step five.
Check that the fat is very hot before adding
the butter.
Now, pour the mixture into the tin.
It should sizzle and place back into the oven.
Step six.
The pudding will take between 15 and 20 minutes
to rise and get crispy, will also turn a golden
brown color.
Step seven.
As soon as you see the pudding is done, remove
it from the oven and serve it up straightaway.
If you allow it to sit it will go soggy.
And that is how to make Yorkshire pudding
the Videojug way.
