Fuzzy Navel Recipe
Drinks With Diablo ~ The Fuzzy Navel
Hello welcome once again to the theFNDC.com's Youtube channel.
I am your Maestro of Mixology, John your bartender.
and today we're making a Fuzzy Navel.
This is one of my favorite drinks in the world to make .
and all you need is Orange Juice,
Peach schnapps and Vodka . 
Very basic,
>> Cortney: Whoop.
>> Dîablø: I have Blood Orange vodka here right now .
Preferentially, If you have Peach Vodka that'd probably be best,
 if you have Orange Vodka that's okay.
So anyway, here's what we do -
We add 1 ounce Peach Schnapps,
Maybe a little extra.
and then 1/2 ounce of your Vodka .
I remember the very first time i had peach vodka
and a Fuzzy Navel and i just thought it was the greatest thing ever.
okay anyway, got that. Top it off with your Orange juice,
>> Cortney: Too much.
>> Dîablø: It's not too much. [ laughs ]
Stir it up . And then for an extra touch add a cherry or two .
there we go, good to go,  lets try it. See what we got.
