hi we're making salmon so simple salmon
it literally is going to take
you 10 minutes to make the whole meal
seriously join me and Ally my
lady I bought some wild salmon at the
fish store looks pretty good looks
pretty good mhm Let's Pretend This is
for your family for four people okay
okay okay let's see I like the salmon
skin you can have your Monger fish
monger take off your skin I think it's
great to cook with a skin and it also
basically comes off anyway when you cook
it the way we're cooking it we're going
to season it we're going to start with
our oil each piece of fish gets a half a
teaspoon of nice olive oil we're going
to do an eigh a
teaspoon per piece of fish
of
[Music]
salt
pepper let's do three turns per slice
one two three I'm going to turn on my
boiler okay we are going to slice up two
lemons and we're going to get six slices
out of
it so each piece of fish gets three
slices so oh you they get a little bed
you get a bed of lemon oh okay going to
make a little bed of
time isn't this lovely beautiful and
sweet and
elegant I want to tell you one thing
though you want to make sure that your
time rests quietly and safely under your
fish okay lay it on top look at
it with this salmon I'm putting it on a
lower rack so it's definitely broiling
but it's not at its hottest place in the
oven I'm going to set the timer for 4
minutes yummy let's check let's pull it
out just just to be sure look at those
Sleeping Princess we're going to just
check it well show me how to check cuz I
don't even know how I would check take
us skinny little pairing
knife and you know you want it to fake
this is pulling so it's so it's
definitely not done okay but that's good
this is a lesson in not over boiling
your fish so how long are you going to
put it in now I'm going to put it in for
three more minutes
okay wow look at that
I'd say it's rustic I love rustic I know
me too here squeeze a little
LM that is look at that it's hot hot
take the fork hold the fork I thought we
were doing the wedding cake
thing is it so hot are you burning your
mouth just smoke coming out of your
mouth is that
incredible me get it it's tender and
fresh I don't understand how something
so easy can be so good I really don't
they make it so complicated and it
doesn't have to be doesn't have to be
less is more I would call that a 10 to
12 minute
meal I need an ice pack for my mouth
