hello guys and girls my wife yesterday
asked me to make her
a bird housee for our parrot so that's
what we're going to do today simple bird
house four sides front
back a hole in front and I'm going to
put Ines on the roof so we can open it
and clean it out once in a while
so let's get started on this I put a
stop block here so I'm going to cut four
of
these and with a stop block well it
ensures that my four pieces are going to
be the same width
there we have it I got four identical
piece and uh it'll go something like
this so very simple
so what I'm going to do is
uh I'm going to uh take my little nailer
with some glue and start nailing those
and uh we should be square
on then we'll worry about the the front
and the
back but I'm thinking maybe I want to
leave a lip in the front so the bird can
land in the front before getting into
the house
uh
like like
so so maybe I'm going to cut a little
bit off the
back yeah I'm going to cut so three of
these
pieces I need to cut some off the
back so
I'm going to cut
roughly let's see
here front lip doesn't have to be that
big
maybe something like
this now I'm going to put my stop loock
here
right
there so I'm going to cut three of these
pieces and
keep the bottom side longer so my bird
can perch on it
a birdh house that's going to look
something like this we're going to have
a front we're going to have a little
perch here
glue on my surfaces
front and
[Music]
back glue this like
this that's the
back put some
glue all around
Square this up on on our corners and put
One Nail
there we need our Center for our hole
I'm going to just drill the
hole and take my jiga and cut it around
[Music]
this is a fixed piece so we're going
to glue this
up so now we just got this piece here to
put on here's a funny iner it's a double
inch I think it was off of one of those
wooden blinds or something you know what
I'm just going to cut this in two and
I'm going to have two small Ines
[Music]
[Applause]
the third inch part you can go like
this and turn it right around like this
that's that's kind of cool so you go
like
this there you go
[Music]
my garage door is closed so I'm going to
hook the vacuum to it
[Music]
[Music]
perfect now I'm just going to clamp it
just for a little bit
here's a note for a bird house you don't
want to put any kind of linseed oil or
Danish oil or paint or nothing like that
you just want to leave it as it
is um because any any of that stuff
could make your bird sick and probably
will they're pretty sensitive my bird
house is
dry very
functional all right on that note guys
I'm going to go put this in the bird's
cage
and uh we'll catch you on my next video
[Applause]
