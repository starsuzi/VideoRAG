hi everyone and welcome to Amy learns to
cook on the show today we're going out
to the grill we are going to be making a
huge vegetable Grill feast in a
vegetable basket sent to me from cave
tools.com I am really interested in
trying this basket out I love to make
stuff on the barbecue and this is a
great way to barbecue a bunch of
vegetables that would otherwise fall
through the racks right in in this
stainless steel basket so join me as we
grill some vegetables in a vegetable
basket from Cav tools.com
[Music]
okay so I just want to take this
opportunity to thank Cav tools.com for
sending me this stainless steel
vegetable basket um we've done a test of
a few of their products they're really
great they're great people over there
and if you're interested in any um
barbecue products I'll put a link in the
description for this item so here's our
vegetable basket and it is made out of
stainless steel so this is pretty much
what we're going to be doing we chopped
a whole bunch of vegetables in our
previous upload I'll put a link in the
description for that and we're going to
put them on the grill and make a big
huge vegetable stir fry
so as I said this is from cave tools.com
and um it's great because unlike
aluminum foil the vegetable basket lets
in the barbecue flavors through the Bas
the holes in the basket so um stuff
doesn't fall through the um grill grates
it um it makes great side dishes and
it's dishwasher safe so let's open this
up and see what we have
woo
nice it's actually a lot bigger than I
thought it would be that's going to hold
a lot so here's our vegetable Grill
basket and it's basically made out of
stainless steel so you can put this in
the dishwasher that is one great thing
about this cuz you know how things get
on the barbecue it just gets covered and
everything right um going in the
dishwasher makes it a lot easier and
more convenient to use that um so here
it says cave tools and pretty much um we
are going to go ahead and we're going to
wash this and we're going to put our
marinated vegetables in here and then
we're going to take it to the grill so
we have a big huge bowl full of
vegetables we chopped this up on the
previous upload using a really nice
knife from Lao Kingdom I'll put it Link
in the description for that so we're
pretty much going to marinate them and
so since this bowl is so huge um I'm
going to do this in two bags so what we
have here is we have some onion so we're
going to give each bag some
onion
whoop and we have green
beans
wow more onion
I'm losing
some I think I'm going to get rid of
these and we have bell
pepper we have tomato this is like a
bowl of candy like on for Halloween it
seems
like um and we
have got some tomatoes in here we have a
bunch of
zucchini wow this this is
beautiful more zuc
and
wow I'm pretty much going to take a lot
of this to work I'm probably going to
grill up a piece of chicken with it and
um take it for
lunch so I'm looking forward to that so
I'm going to do a really simple marinade
on this I'm going to use a bottle of
craft zesty Italian you can make your
own Italian or you can use just use this
right it's got a lot of seasoning in it
we're probably going to have to um salt
and pepper this to taste on the grill
but we're going to go ahead and dump
this in
here and I'm pretty much putting one
bottle in Each
baggie woo
and we're going to close these
up wow this will feed a
crowd let me take a little bit of this
air
out I'm not trying to toss around a
balloon here this one
too
and we're going to give it a little
Shake make sure it's closed
just going to shake it around get all
these vegetables nice and coated in this
bag we're going to do the same for the
other and to be honest with you you can
make up if you made four big bowls of
these vegetables and put them in a bag
like this and with the marinade you can
drop this baby into the
freezer and then when you want grilled
vegetables for the week
just put them in your freezer just like
this take a bag out let them fall and
throw them right in your vegetable
basket on the
grill wow so we're going to let this sit
doesn't have to sit too long maybe 15
minutes and we're going to take this out
to the grill and try out our cave tools
Grill basket so our vegetables are
marinated up and we're going to go ahead
and we're going to put them into our
Grill basket I have it over a plate just
because there's a lot of dressing here
and I don't want it to um I don't want
it to flare up too
bad and wow they're looking really good
and they fit nice in here too so we
pretty much have two batches of this so
we're going to go ahead and put it on
the grill so we have our Grill going we
have a hot side here where all the
charcoal's on this side we have a cool
Zone over here the charcoal is pushed
all over here so if it gets out of hand
we can move it over there so let's let
her rip we got our cave tools vegetable
basket and we're going to put it just
right here in the middle
woo
nice love the sizzle Sizzle
Sizzle and the grill basket is doing
great allowed the smoke and stuff to
come through but at the same time the
vegetables are staying above the
grate oo we're getting some
nice grilling going on
here we don't want to soften them too
much but we want to take that uh edge
off of the zucchini
[Music]
and we're going to season it up with a
little S&P a little salt and
papier give it a little bit of
flavor vegetables need quite a bit
because they'll be Bland
otherwise and we'll give it a little
stir
action looking kind of
tasty okay so our veggies are done and
the cave tools Grill basket did awesome
so we're just going to Plate up a little
bit of
it um get some bell peppers and onions
zucchini we're going to get a little bit
of um
maters on here we need maters
right so I'm going to give this a quick
taste let's get the
Tomato Wow Let's Get some
zucchini you can hear me
crunching I like it where it has a
little bit of crunch
you don't want to take zucchini too far
cuz it'll just be mush we got some green
beans
here M there's a little bit of smoky
flavor on
it Little
Onion this right here is
fantastic
um you don't get much better than this
this is really really
delicious and you couldn't cook
something like this just straight on the
grill because all this would fall apart
but the grill basket does a great
job and just dishwasher
safe that's what I
like so folks I give the cave tools
Grill basket my big thumbs up so if
