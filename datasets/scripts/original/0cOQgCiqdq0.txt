KARINA GARCIA: How satisfying
is this gold slime?
I am living for it.
What's up, y'all?
Nickelodeon's
Kids' Choice Sports
Awards are coming up soon.
Michael Phelps is
receiving the Kids'
Choice Sports Legend Award.
So in honor, Nickelodeon
asked me to try and make
my own version of gold slime.
To make some gold slime, I'm
starting off with clear glue.
If you use white glue, your gold
slime is honestly just going
to look like peanut butter.
Y'all also know I love
jumbo batches of slime,
so we're adding lots and lots
of glue into our mixing bowl.
Also, a quick tip for
making clear slime
is adding water
and mixing it in.
The more clear we can keep
this, the more the gold is going
to shine through our slime.
Now it's time to add
our slime activator.
We're going to use baking soda
and contact lens solution.
Now it's time for the fun part.
Let's make this slime gold.
I have two different
shades of gold.
And I'm going to start
off by pouring this really
pretty loose pigment.
Ooh!
Looks so pretty already.
Now it's time for some
contact lens solution.
This is when the magic happens.
Hello, slime.
Keep adding this in slowly
and mix it until you get
the consistency that you want.
It's super loose and sticky.
It's so relaxing.
I could literally bathe
in this and be so happy.
So I feel like the gold
slime from the Kids' Choice
Sports Awards is darker gold.
This is more of a yellow gold.
So I'm mixing in
another shade of gold.
There you go.
Now it's looking more
like the Kids' Choice
Sports Awards gold slime.
OK, really?
How satisfying is
this gold slime?
It's so pretty, so metallic,
I am living for it.
And there is my
version of gold slime!
