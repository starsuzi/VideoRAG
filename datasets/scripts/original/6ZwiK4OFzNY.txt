all right folks today we're going to
show you how to uh cook a turnip or
two in a uh pressure cooker crock potty
thing this is a power cooker it's a
pressure cooker uh it has a a container
here that you put your stuff in set it
inside here uh turn it on it only goes
for 30 minutes at a time which is real
pain to butt cuz some stuff you want to
cook for an hour hour and a half
especially if it's a cheap piece of rib
meat or something you want them really
really soft but um other than that it
works pretty good you just got to after
it cooks for 30 minutes you got to reset
it the timer cook for another 30 minutes
but um at any rate it's nice this thing
comes out makes it easy to wash so we're
going to put our we're going to first
thing we're going to do is peel our
turnips and then uh we'll put those in
there with some other stuff and we'll
show you that so off to peel
turnips
all right now that we got our turnup
peeled we're going to cut it
[Music]
up
all right in this case we're just going
to make it nice and simple we're going
to put in some uh brown sugar and we're
going to do this very scientifically and
measure very
carefully uh we got two big two big
turnips in
there so
uh I'm thinking that might be enough
brown
sugar and uh we're also going to use
some regular black ground pepper and
again very
scientifically uh do
this and we'll sprinkle some of that in
there and I think we're going to let's
call it quits there we can always put
some salt and stuff in it uh when it's
done but um we're just going to take put
the lid on this turn it on and let it
cook down now one thing to note on this
we're not adding any water or anything
because this is a pressure cooker and
the lid is is airtight uh vapor tight uh
as it Cooks it's going to let off steam
that steam's going to hit the top it's
going to fall right back down into it so
there's plenty of enough liquid already
in the turnup uh that we don't have to
add any liquid to it uh we're putting
the top on it just like we showed you uh
and uh it will just magically all merge
together and cook all right so uh we got
our our pressure cooker our power cooker
plugged in now one we we hit a let me
start it from the beginning uh when we
hit
cook um it's going to start off at 15
minutes and to get it to increase we're
going to have to keep pushing the
button so we push that button down when
you get to 29 30 if you hit it one more
time it starts way back over at one so
uh kind of an annoying feature of the
power cooker uh but you'll get used to
that so
um and we'll start this up and when we
get to 29 we'll carefully hit it one
more time so it starts at 30 and then it
will start cooking okay uh the lid just
locked it
turns you set it down set it down on
there turn it this uh this handle thing
goes towards the front and then you got
some vents and some releases back here
um but we'll let that cook for 30
minutes and we'll check on our turnips
to see how it looks all right it's been
30 minutes uh since we put our turnips
in our power cooker and um
going push that release
button and that'll take a second or two
for that to vent
out and then we'll open it up and see
what our turnips look like smells
turny
now this just turned off a few seconds
ago so it takes a while to vent uh if
you let it set for 10 or 15 minutes it
doesn't take quite so
long and once all that pressure is gone
you can open
it and uh we'll set that in the
sink and remember I told you there was
plenty whoa we just fogged up our lens
here remember I told you there was
plenty of liquid in there you can you
can see it bubbling away um or you can
see it right there plenty of
liquid we'll get a fork and see how soft
these
are
all right we want these to be kind of
fall apart mushy oh yeah those are good
consistency so uh we'll take those out
and mush them up and eat them they're
going to be
delicious
