so I'm going to show you how to make a
sunflower cupcake I've got my cupcake
here and then I've got some cream cheese
frosting doesn't matter what color this
is and I'm just going to get a fairly
even
layer over the top now this is really
just for the um Center to adhere
to cuz the center's going to be done
with chocolate sprinkles
so I've got a bag here with a nozzle and
the nozzle is a Wilton
366 okay so it looks like
that can you see that and then it's kind
of it's a bit flat actually and sort of
pointy on the sides so slightly
counterintuitively I'm going to put it
so that the v's are either side and the
point is towards the cake and then I'm
just going to allow some icing to come
out and then pull away allow some iing
to come out and then pull away and I'm
just going to do that all the way around
the cake so this is my
first layer of petals don't worry too
much about how perfect they are because
the sunflowers tend to be quite
imperfect don't they looks more natural
if it's not too
uniform and
then once we've done that row we're just
going to do another row just in between
the petals that we've already done
so just going all the way
around and then once we get to where we
started just get the chocolate strands
these ones are just from the local
supermarket it's fine to use I was
initially looking for those ones which
are the like chocolate verelli type
strands but actually these ones I think
are better cuz they're a bit darker but
either's fine and I'm just going to tip
those into the
center and just give the cake a little
shake to just distribute them a bit more
evenly if you need to fill in any gaps
it's nice if you have a good solid
Center
and there we have it
my sunflower cupcake
