all right everyone so today we're going
to look at how to clean your hedgehog
I've done Hedgehog bath videos in the
past but this time I'm going to get more
in detail just how to clean them so what
you need is a rag a toothbrush and some
small animal or cat uh gentle shampoo so
the first thing I'm going to do is turn
on my hot water and get the temperature
right you just want it to be a little
bit warm not hot just not like cold it's
already warm cuz I had it on earlier so
just fill up the water not too much
we're not going bath we just want some
water in
there come on Hedgehog the end of the
sink is
there going to put in a little bit of a
shampoo or small animal uh gentle soap
and then I'm just going to mix that
around since the water was already in
there and then I'll just throw in my uh
towel here kind of lay it
down and put my hedgehog in
here so now I've got a a wet
towel my hedgehog in there and you can
take the wet
towel and just pretty much rub it over
it makes it really easy cuz now you have
a wet towel so you can just kind of keep
lifting it up and rubbing them
off don't have to get their face too
much but you do want to make sure to get
their
feet you could do this in the sink or
you could just do it like in a bucket or
something too if you wanted to do it you
know not in your
sink and then the toothbrush is good too
if they have anything stuck on them
she's pretty clean but their feet you
can easily get down and use use a soft
toothbrush not a hard one and you can
easily get down and wipe off their feet
they don't even move them too
[Applause]
much and then if they had something on
their quills you can kind of use it like
a brush and brush off their quills CU
it'll get it'll get into their quills
better than the um rag will don't go the
wrong way go with the quills so you're
not hurting
them so once you've wiped them down a
lot empty out the water I'm going to
take her out just put her up here for a
second and now I'm going to rinse out my
rag I didn't put in too much soap so it
shouldn't be too much soap left on
her near the
edge so now that uh she's clean we got
to make sure to get all the soap off CU
soap can uh dry out this pin a lot more
than just water alone and hedgehogs so
you don't want to give baths too much or
wash them too much because their skin
can dry out so you definitely want to
get all the soap off the water right now
is a really good temperature I'm just
going to turn it down a little
bit
that's good and now I'm just going to
put her in the sink with the water
running and I'm just going to make sure
that she gets water all over her wipe
her off a little bit more with the uh
towel here just trying to get all the
soap off get underneath
too
and now that she's pretty much got the
soap off I'm just going to make sure she
does so she's pretty good I'm just going
to rinse her under the water for a
little bit
here make sure like I said we get both
sides and now she's done clean and half
happy Hedgehog now I just got to get a
dry towel grab one out of the other room
and put her in there for a couple
minutes have her dry off and then she
can go back in her cage and be
happy so that's how you give a hedgehog
a bath see you guys later
