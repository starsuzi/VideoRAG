in my restaurant we go through a lot of
tomatoes so I'm going to show you two
ways to get the core out of a tomato
really fast and really efficiently take
both ends off the Tomato stand it on its
flat end and then cut off all four sides
the other way to do it is you take the
top and bottom off your tomato make one
slice and then insert the knife and sort
of roll and cut at the same time while
you cut the core out of the Tomato voila
and you've got perfect tomato ready for
salsa you can use the cores in vegetable
stock you can throw them in tomato sauce
you don't have to discard them
completely
