would you believe that in your yard is
food this is dandelion most people know
it as a weed but believe it or not you
can eat it do you like
dandelion so dandelion from your yard
tastes best before it's gone to flower
so this here is in pretty good shape
hasn't flowered yet cup of flour is
coming out
but that's good it has a lot of vitamins
in it
you can put this in a salad so here's
another patch of an alleged weed um this
is you know gone to flour
already it's still good you can eat it
it's a little more bitter but with like
a really strong dressing and some blue
cheese this this stuff is great
especially if you like sour things or
tart things you know a little bit of
lemon olive oil and scallion maybe a lot
of blue cheese I like blue cheese do you
like
dandelion horses love
dandelion dandelion good oh
boy are you eating
[Music]
dirt it's
here that's it yeah that one's pretty
muddy scallions yeah
that works you go over there
okay so we got some dandelion from the
Food Co-op um it can be kind of Muddy so
I just run it through the uh salad
spinner
Gizmo cleaned it up what we have here is
I've got some dandelion greens which are
um
they're
good um I've got cucumbers and cherry
tomatoes cherry tomatoes you just cut
them in half and they work a lot better
in salads cuz otherwise you're trying to
poke them and they fly around ow um
avocado scallion and some blue cheese so
it's pretty simple I've got a little uh
vinegarette I made here with uh balsamic
vinegar olive oil mustard and salt and
pepper it's your you know your kind of
like regular mustard kind of
dressing salad greens go in I like to
give the salad greens a toss before I
put in the rest of the ingredients I
like the leaves to
get coated before all the other stuff is
before the all the other stuff goes
in
cucumbers and cherry tomatoes yeah I
just went to this I just went to the
store and bought some stuff that looked
interesting the cucumbers are for our
from our garden uh the cherry tomatoes
are from the Food Co-op avocado I like
avocado cuz it just gets kind of
mushy and then
[Music]
scallion and now we're ready to Plate
the
dish so I put the blue cheese on but I
don't like to put the blue cheese in the
salad while we're tossing I like to put
it on top a little trick I learned
instead of trying to cut the blue
cheese
scissors it cuts really nicely just cut
little
pieces and it falls right in I think
blue cheese gets lost in a salad if you
try and toss it in a bowl little blue
cheese a little piece of
tomato little
dandelion
that's
great it's really good you get the
bitterness of the
dandelion and like the smoothness of the
avocado and the balsamic kind of mixes
it all together so I like
it
