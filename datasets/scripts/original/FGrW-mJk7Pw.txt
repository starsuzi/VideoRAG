hey guys this is one on rabbits I'm
doing a video today on how to clean your
litter box part
one I posted a video um about how to do
this a while ago um but I'm just doing
it again because I have two different
ways I actually do it hiy
mocha um so I'm just going to redo um
this the kind that I do here um which is
part one and then part two is going to
be um the other way I clean my litter
boxes so um I guess we have to hold on a
second because he is going to the
bathroom but um the supplies you'll need
um to do to clean the this litter box is
a litter
scoop um this is just for cats paper
towel um vinegar and water mixture and a
plastic bag I
prefer the ones made for like your
kitchen garbage just because they're
bigger and it doesn't get stuff all over
um so that's what I prefer um now I have
to try to get mocha out of the litter
box so I can show you how to do it buddy
you got to get out now got to get out
now okay so the first thing you have to
do is take
your
bag and your litter box and just put the
whole litter box in the bag here wait
see if you can see this better
just like that and then dump it
out just like that
um so now I'm going to take my litter
scoop and you can see there's some like
stuff stuck on there and I'm just going
to scrape it
off just like this
and then dump it in the
bag so now it's pretty
clean and just set your bag aside and
take your vinegar and water mixture um
and just spray it in your lter
box try to spray it where there's a lot
of um stuff to get off so then it can
just soak it all up
okay so now let me see if you can get a
better view of
this there it is um as you can see like
um there's still some crumbs of the
litter left over so now we're going to
take the paper
towel and I just take my
who sorry sorry I always Zoom the
opposite way okay um and you just take
it and I fold it in half and then in
half again um it's just so it's
thicker and oh you can also use a rag
but I'm too
lazy so just go and you scrub the bottom
out just like
this then I'm just going to throw it
away take one more piece of paper
towel pull it in half fold it in half
again and then do the
sides of the litter
box like
this um so there we go
now the litter box all nice and clean um
and now I'm going to just put litter in
it which I'll bring it over here
and oh
mocha okay sorry about that um I'm just
going to this is where I keep my
litter just going to open that up
and take my
scoop and what I do is I actually have
like this sand sifter thing that little
kids use for like sifting sand and stuff
um and I do that because sometimes
there's a lot of
little powder in there that gets mixed
in with the pellets and I just shake it
out so it's not in the
litter so then I just go ahead and
JP in it with pine pellets you don't
need that much litter because um it
absorbs pretty
well so there we go you just kind of
Stir It Out equally and then you put hay
in it and it's good to go so this is
part one on how to clean a litter box
part two will have um the other way I
clean it so
yeah um see you guys soon
