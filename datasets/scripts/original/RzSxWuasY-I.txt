hello everyone today we are going to
make a plaster SL gypsum Nest I'm going
to use it for my meas end Colony but you
can use it for any end Colony before we
start Let's uh see what items we need uh
we need a Dremel um it's just a basic
Dremel which you can use to um you know
cut out of stuff we will use that to to
carve the uh tunnels and the
chambers so let's put that the way
you also need modeling plaster or
modeling gypsum I got like 3 Kg here I
believe that's like 6 lb I'm not
entirely sure but it should be enough to
fill your container that you're going to
use I got two containers here two
plastic containers the idea is that we
are going to fill this up with gypsum
and then when it's dried up we turn it
upside down get the gypsum out and then
or the plaster whatever you call it and
then uh carve the nest out like the
tunnels and the and the rooms optionally
you could also use um plastic tubing if
your nest or if the um like the level of
your nest is to here you can add some
plastic tubing to the surface like this
and then hook it up to another
formicarium or to another Nest so let's
get started okay so it seems like
um let's see where the English
instructions are over here
so to pour this stuff we need uh 3 and
1/2 L of water for 5 kg of
powder
so I need to add 3 and 1/2 L to
this so I've got 3 and 1/2 L of water
here I found a big uh bucket which I can
use so let's use that so I guess I have
to pour all the uh gypsum in
I hope you guys can see
[Music]
it looks
nice stir very well and then we can pour
it in the uh container
[Music]
okay let's try to pour
it oh that goes very
[Music]
well okay so we got more than enough so
I'll get my other container as well okay
so we got the second container
[Music]
okay so this is
about two of those little containers and
I've got a little bit
left so let's just have this stuff
dry and then we can start carving The
Nest so the gypsum seems to be settling
on the bottom and the water is like
floating on
top so that's a good
sign the plastic is like compacting and
later we can um pour the water out I
guess so that's awesome it does mean the
nests will get a little bit smaller
though but that's okay it's a good uh
size so here we are I actually had to
drain the water because there was way
too much water in there
I'll try to show you it's all drained
now and it's starting to
dry it's still a little bit soft like if
I try
to let's see if I try
to push on it I can still push little
dents in it so it's still too
wet so in a few hours I will try to um
to get them
out let's see there's a little bit of
bubbles in there
I hope uh those won't be a problem I
don't think they will
be the the plaster really compacted like
uh I expected The Nest to become like uh
this thick but since all the plaster
dropped down and the water uh was
floating on
top the plaster actually got way uh the
nest is way lower than I wanted it to be
this one is a little bit higher like put
them next to each
other but you know it's still fine just
keep that in mind that you have to uh
like I would recommend like if you have
a similar container just put the um
mixed Mi mixture of water and plaster
like this High then the nest will be
this High twice as high as it is right
now but it's uh it's fine maybe um I
will start working on this one if I can
get it out um if I feel like this is too
little plaster I will make some more
plaster and put the plaster on there I'm
like put put more plot plaster on top
and see if I can make it uh thicker like
that okay guys so let's see let's try to
get the first one out um let's start
with the small
one because if that one breaks that's
wow that's not as bad you know it's
still not complet completely dry yet I
can still like crumble the loose bits
off but that's normal you know I can
still make Impressions on it so I have
to be very careful so I got this wooden
um piece of wood here which I can like
make it rest on so that it doesn't uh
fall down uh too hard so let's try to um
hit it a few times
[Music]
still no cracks so that's
good but how do I get it
[Music]
out okay let's try to press on the
outsides a little bit so that they will
uh it will like Get
Loose okay let's try it again there's a
little bit more room now around the
edges
[Music]
okay there it's
coming there it is okay
awesome okay so let's make sure it
doesn't
fall as you can see it's just
perfect I can still like oh that's okay
actually I cannot uh make indents on it
just try to make it as flat as I
can let's try to
make it even
flatter so as you can see it's very easy
to uh
manipulate we have to get a nice
bit which probably works very
well um for the for what we want to
do so let's put it in there what are we
going to put it
on let's put it on here for now okay so
uh what we can do now is like uh tramble
out uh a tunnel like over here
[Music]
okay so it gets very messy messy as you
can
see um I think it has to dry a little
bit
more and I will show
you zoom out a little
bit so as you can see the the ends can
enter from here I will probably make
that hole uh bigger and then they can
walk down
and go inside the first chamber so there
will be a lot of Chambers all around but
until now I will just um for now I'll
just let the gypsum or the plaster dry
okay so it's a day later and the gypsum
or the plaster is um way more dry so we
should be able to use the Dremel a
little better
[Music]
now okay so let's take a look
that's really nice so they enter from
here go down there and they should be
able to continue down the side but with
a um little tunnel that we will
[Music]
make okay so let's try to get that stuff
out um I'll use a little
[Music]
stick let's
see oh yeah it works very well you can
just scoop it out
[Music]
okay so let's
see it gets a lot less messy as well now
this is U from the last
time and this little Trill over here is
from now so that's a big difference it's
way the plastic is way more dry so
that's great
[Music]
[Music]
let's
see okay so let's zoom out a
bit here we
are try to show it off to you guys okay
so here they can come in like
this there's a nice little first chamber
a little deeper
chamber um like a uh a
split that path splitting into two and a
very big chamber probably for the queen
and a j moves so they can put EGS in
here and EG in here or seeds if they
want and then later on we can connect
all the nest here okay so let's clean up
the
block let's see it's a complete mess
like all the gips and it's sprayed
everywhere okay so here we are it's all
cleaned up looking nice me move the
camera a little bit looks very awesome
right okay so
now let's try to get the Block in inside
and see if it fits
nicely so I
thought we should do it the same way we
got it out
like um put it upside down on this
little
thing and
then
shove the bucket back over very
[Music]
carefully try to keep the bucket clean
and that's a perfect fit right there
okay let's press it
on let's turn it back
over okay that that looks very
nice so here we
are let's
see there's a lot of muck on my camera I
have to clean it looks very messy okay
so let me take the camera off and show
you guys
okay so I will probably have to pour a
little bit of um gypsum plaster on the
sides just to make sure that it is um
fits very tightly yeah as you can see
it's I don't think they can get through
it's very tight fit okay so here's the
entrance of the nest so let me turn it
around this is so awesome you can see
them
enter and see them walk through here
through the
nests let's see into the bigger
Chambers and the split that we made and
the very big chamber over here and the
the the storage chambers basically and
then later on we could like drill a hole
here and add another um a tube if you
want and we'll probably put it right
here and let's see make a little bit
more room later
and then like connect it up this side
and into the the little plastic
container so that they can walk from the
corner into the
nest that would be awesome right okay so
I'll make a second video um when with
the ends in it I will edit it to the end
of this video so that you can very
easily click through to the next so it
will probably be finished next week from
now so um yeah thank you thank you guys
