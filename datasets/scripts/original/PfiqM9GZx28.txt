hey guys
um so I just got these uh Starbucks you
know French roast dark
coffee beans that I was about to grind
in my Vitamix a3500 series grinder
um so I thought I might as well just put
a quick video together to just kind of
show to you how that's done because I
did some research online didn't really
find many videos about this so yeah so
why not right uh so what I've got here
is
um two bowls of uh you know the coffee
that I just showed you all we gotta do
is pour them into this jar
make sure that this jar is really dry
because that's very important
um just put the lid on just make sure
that you hear that sound
okay yeah gotta hear that sound now
what's important here is that
um you gotta put it up from zero to a
speed of 10 for the time period of 25
seconds make sure it's not Beyond 25
seconds because you might grind a bit
too much which you don't want to do so
here we go I'm just gonna start it now
thank you
[Music]
all right
so let's check what we've got here okay
that seems perfect
um
so you see
so that's that's perfect coffee
for me so I'm gonna go enjoy my coffee
now hope this helps alright bye now take
care
