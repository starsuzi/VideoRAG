hi everyone today I'm going to show you
how to make steamed rice cakes first
you'll need one bag of rice flour in one
bag of tapioca starch and you want to
pour this into a plastic bowl
next you'll have one and a half cups of
sugar
four cups of warm water
and you can certainly substitute 2 cups
of water with 2 cups of coconut milk if
you would like a coconut flavor for your
rice cakes
well you want to stir everything
together and make sure there are no
lungs
[Music]
now take this and set it aside you'll
need one cup of rice flour combined with
four cups of water in a non-stick pan or
a nonstick watch as I am using here
you want to stir everything until it is
nice and slow
[Music]
now you'll want to cook this over
medium-low heat
and remember to continuously stir
because you don't want the rice flour to
settle on the bottom of the pan and firm
[Music]
you'll want to keep stirring until the
mixture starts to pick it
[Music]
[Music]
then you'll turn off the heat and you'll
take this and add it to the first mist
mixture
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now be sure to stir everything until
it's nice and smooth you want no lumps
[Music]
then you want to add one pouch of baking
powder or two and a half teaspoons of
baking powder
[Music]
next year want to add one pouch of
instant dry yeast or two and a half
teaspoon and you'll want to mix
everything until it's well combined
[Music]
[Music]
then you want to cover it and let it sit
for one hour after one hour your mixture
should look like this
and it should have risen and dropped
[Music]
then you'll want to steam it for 10
minutes here I poured the mixture into
little cups and steamed it you can also
use cupcake pans mini cupcake pans a
tape pan just remember that when you
steam things in a larger pan such as a
cupcake pan you'll have to steam it a
little longer I also add food coloring
here I have pink and green I hope you
