Hi, I am Jeff for ePest Solutions.
Today we are going to talk about the Dekko
Silverfish Packs.
When you have an interior infestation of silverfish
they can be difficult to eradicate without
the use of non-repellent sprays and baits
like the Dekko Silverfish Packs.
These are a product that the box is going
to come with 24 individual baits.
And each station is just a paper wiper, it
is corrugated much like cardboard looks.
Silverfish are what they call phyllotactic;
they like to be inside cracks.
So this is going to mimic a very comfortable
situation for the silverfish.
It's got a glue which silverfish like to feed
on; it's impregnated with boric acid.
So what you're going to want to do is put
these underneath every sink in every wet area.
So kitchens, bathrooms, you want to have one
of these underneath the cabinets.
Silverfish, a lot of times get in drawers
where your utensils are or where the pots
and pans are stored.
So go ahead and stick one of these into each
one of those drawers and cabinets.
In closets, another place where silverfish
goes, you need to put one of these on the
floor near the back of the wall or on the
side of the closet for a small closet.
For big closets, two, three or four might
be sufficient.
These are definitely going to be a must in
your eradication of the silverfish problem.
Also, if you are trying to prevent silverfish,
it is also good to put these out and keep
them fresh every three months.
We always have these in stock here at ePest
Solutions, so order them today; they are going
to out today, free shipping.
