 Hello, this is Sunny. Welcome back. Have you seen the movie, Caddy Shack? It was a very funny movie. There are several clips about how to get rid of Goofers. Not Goofers. Goofers. I finished! Sir, do you know what I just saw? No sir, I'm Goofers! Goofers! Goofers! I want you to kill every Goofer on the course. Checking if I'm wrong, Sandy, but if I kill all the Goofers, they're gonna lock me up if you throw away the key. Goofers! You're great! Get not Goofers! The little brown furry rodents! We can do that. It turned out those brown furry rutins are tough, and very hard to get rid of. But they are very annoying. They could turn your nice lawn into a mess. I have tried many methods, like poisonous peanuts, mouth balls, and repellent powders. But the results were not that great. So, so I bought this one. It's called a Moe and Goofersonic Spike. It is supposed to produce some squeaky noise. You just heard a moment ago. It's a kind of a produce, kind of a noise, which will not drive your animal, like your pet, like my dog, crazy, but it's supposed to drive the Goofers away. Okay? Goofers, not Goofers. Okay. And the protein site is whole. Like this. And you will hear some squeaky noise. I said freeze Goofers.
