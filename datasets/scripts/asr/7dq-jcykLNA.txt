That's right this is my product review video and I have a couple of items to share with you and as you see the items before you I just want to add this disclaimer they were purchased by me with my own coins for my own pleasure and enjoyment. Well with our further do let's get into it. First of all you see their ergonomic memory foam pillow. I purchased this from Walgreens. It was on sale for $9.99 but when I got up to the cash register they had an extra 50% off and it was only $4.50. So I purchased it okay and this is what it looks like okay and I have to let you guys know in this big box that it was in it was a little it was it was like almost double the size now it's flat okay like a pancake and it gives me no support so it is going by by in the trash and one thing I have to tell you guys this is the most important thing it was in less than one week okay so that was really a waste of money but I'm glad that that it wasn't a lot of money and for you out there who are saying well it's supposed to get a little flat no it's not my husband has a real one and this is not what they do they don't turn it to pancakes and they do not give you no support okay next I have the older eliminators and I have the first two here let me show those to you this one here and also the one by sure since I purchased these and if you go back on my videos I purchased these six months ago from big lots they were only a dollar and they truly do what they say they do in fact I just changed them out I had kind of forgotten about them last month someone was sitting on the sofa and they said what do you have over here what did you spray over here and I'm like I nothing you know and then I remembered she was sitting on the corner where the older eliminator was was at she was right in that area and so anyhow this is what it was and it also reminded me it was time to change them out but okay we're talking about six months for a dollar okay and I still have a good throw and I'm going to show you what it looks like and I mean this is like after the fact okay this is six months ago okay and also I live in an area where it is very cold so we have our heater on so you know that can help dry things out but it didn't do anything that it I mean these these this is good for six months okay and then like I say it still had a throw and when I did check it and last month I did notice it was still they still had like the little they they had moisture they were still they still had a little moisture and I could still smell them so I left them until I got some more which is the ones behind here I've got linen breeze I purchase both of these from roses for one dollar so I will see how those are so this is the products that I have purchased and I've given you the reviews on them if you like this video please thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe thank you goodbye
