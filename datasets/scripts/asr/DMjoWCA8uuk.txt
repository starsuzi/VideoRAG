 We were just at the store and buying some dried figs. We were picking out the best ones and then we were just like, why don't we just buy the whole thing? So we asked if they had another one and they said they had another 5 kilo bucks. Here it is. Turkish figs. Excellent quality. So these are really good and we have been eating them for a few days now and we liked them and so we said why not just buy the whole thing? Dry figs are in my opinion a really really good snack, a small meal on the raw fruit based diet. I wouldn't recommend snacking dried fruit throughout the day or a little bit here and there because it sort of sticks to your teeth and that sort of thing. But if you want to do like maybe right before or right after a workout or late at night when you're just a little, maybe dinner wasn't quite enough and you're a little bit hungry before going to bed or anything like that, you can sort of top up on calories just by eating a little bit of dried figs. And they're extremely nutritious when you're looking at their nutritional profile like per calorie, they're actually very nutritious. So yeah that's what we're going to enjoy. So now I'm going to pack them down in these boxes with a lid on to make sure they don't dry up and stay as fresh as possible for as long as possible. I'll show you guys how they look. So they're like you know almost a little bit translucent orange color and they're sort of covered in this crystallized sugar stuff. Super delicious I'm going to try it actually. Mmm wow. Go away on the inside just way we like it. Power food. Well that's all for today. Are you eating any figs these days or dried fruit? Let us know in the comments. We'll take you to the room. See ya.
