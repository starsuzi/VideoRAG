 Hello everyone. Thank you for tuning into my channel. So today I'm here with a super quick and easy vegan pancake recipe. So just a quick backstory. When my family and I went vegan, we had to figure out what we were going to do on Friday mornings because we always used to go to IHOP every single Friday morning for pancake cakes. And it was really important to me that going vegan not feel like a sacrifice, not feel like we had to give up some of our core family times that were around food because we weren't able to find a place that offered vegan options. So I figured out how to make vegan pancakes. And honestly, it's exactly as you would make regular pancakes. The only difference is where the recipe calls for eggs. I use an egg replacer, which is a product that has existed forever for people who are allergic to eggs. I've also used dairy milk instead of cow's milk and vegan butter instead of regular butter. That's it. It's nothing different. I got this recipe off of the bag of flour. So it's something that you don't have to know rocket science or chemistry in order to make. But enjoy. I'm going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
