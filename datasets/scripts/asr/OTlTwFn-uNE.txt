 Hello, I'm Brandon with SelectBilliar. And today I want to talk to you about choosing the right felt color for your pull table. Yes, you go for obvious reasons, what goes well with the table, what goes well with the room. But then on the other side, there's also what goes well with when you play. So black felt looks really nice, but the worst color to play on. So when you get down on a table with black felt and you're aiming for your shot, you're going to tend to see shadows around the pockets. So what happens is it's not very defined anymore on the pocket. So you tend to rattle balls and miss them much more often. So black being the worst color to play on, and then you have your charcoal and your navy blue, also really dark colors, going to have those same problems. If you go to brighter colors like these, you don't have those problems anymore because you, the shadows that get close to the pockets are still very defined on where the pocket is. It doesn't blend with the pocket anymore. It's defined. So you're going to make a lot more balls, not just this color, but all the brighter colors are generally, you're going to play better. So turn of a blue is probably the best color to play on. That's why the pros play on it. The balls are very vivid. The pockets are very vivid. You see everything very well. I'm Brandon Graham's with Sleckblur. And that's how you pick the right thought color for you.
