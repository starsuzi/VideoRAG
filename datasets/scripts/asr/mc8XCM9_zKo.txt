 Okay, this is a test of a solvent-based cleaner called the stripper. It's useful on hardened, tart, asphalt, paint overspray, mastic, all kinds of stuff like that. Basically, we're going to pour it on, let it soak for a little bit, you know, loosen it up enough so that we can scrub it off not much longer. You can see as we start to pour it on there, it's already starting to run a little bit, it's softening it. And if we kept on putting more product on there, it would eventually dissolve everything away. That's not maybe the most economical way to do things. So we're going to scrub it after it softens it. With the first scrubbing in, now we're going to put a little bit more chemical in to it. I'll get the residual out. And there we go.
