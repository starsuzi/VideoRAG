 Have I got a tip for you? Cutting ingredients to perfection or width consistency is a pretty important thing in the kitchen and professional kitchen is essential. Knives are really great. They do a great job at it, but what doesn't even better job is a mandolin. A lot of people are scared of them, but if you know what you're doing, they're just amazing. This is Japanese mandolin. This is my favorite mandolin because it's really cheap. It's really stable. I can adjust the sides and get perfect, perfect slices. Super thin and pretty thick. I actually think it's the safest just because it's got one little blade. I know where the danger is at. It's right there. Let me show you how to use it. I want to start slicing, dude. So there's some basic practices. First one, of course, having a sharp blade. Really sharp blade makes all the difference, just like a knife. Second thing is, when you use it, you want it to be stable. Food, whatever you're going to slice, cut it into something kind of manageable, something like this. Please install a couple slices. I'm going to test for thickness. Those are a little too thin. I'm going to dial this back. I like it. Looks good. So, while this is planted, I'm going to ride the cucumber right on this edge here. I don't want to go in the middle or off to this side. It's a good reference point. You can close your eyes and feel safe. Don't do that. Look at all these slices. That's pretty much all you need to know when it comes to using a Japanese maneline. You just come out. Or just every time. Since you know how to use it now, you should probably put it to good use. Go try making the rat's two-year recipe. Everything on top needs to be sliced to perfection. It's a good challenge, good practice, so it takes that about it. These are good. I'll leave this crap.
