 I'm going to teach you how to cleanse a quartz crystal. This is my quartz right here, but I have. A lot of people touch it in class, so there's a lot of energy stuck in it, and I would want to purify it, so that's what I'm going to do. Now first, to cleanse a quartz crystal, you would need some salt, and I just use a glass. They save us okay for seven hours, but I use one. Reason why is because it doesn't have enough energy in the quartz. So small, you would think energy would be taken. This is my theory by the way, I'm not sure if it's true, but I usually leave it in there for like an hour or so. After that, you just take it out, because mine is so small. Mine probably stores not a lot of energy. For me, it depends on the size of this. This is all opinion based. So anyways, so I'm going to put the salt right here. Actually, I should put water on it, so put water in it first. So after you put water in it, you just get the quartz, and you just put it in the water, and just leave it there for as long as you want. Ah, crap. I hope it didn't break. Nothing will. Okay, so now I just leave the energy, leave it there, and just wait for it to cleanse. It's been an hour, and now we're going to take the crystal out. Already, it's feeling really, really, really, already it's already feeling really clean. But so yeah, now it's clean, and the energy, it feels so much, it feels sticky, but it also feels lighter, and it feels more like colder, and it feels brighter, like you're positive. So if you like this video, like it, comment, subscribe, and I'll see you next time. And I think because this video is linked to crystals, you know, my next video I'll teach you how to either program the crystal or to ordinate with it. Maybe both, I don't know, I'll come up with something, I promise. So stay sharp.
