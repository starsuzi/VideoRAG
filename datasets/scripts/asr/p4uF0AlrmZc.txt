 Hey guys, it's me Serena and today I am ready to show you what makeup I have inside these drawers. So this is going to be my makeup collection and storage video and I'm going to be giving you a little tour of my Alex Nine drawer from IKEA and some over here on my vanity here. So this is just the makeup I have at my mom's house.

So number one again this is from IKEA. The vanity slash desk is from Wayfair and then all the organization that I use inside the drawers is either from Target or the Dollar Tree.
