 Hi, it's Jerry here from lawn and green again. I just want to show you a weed that can cause problems for people's lawns. It's called onion grass as opposed to onion weed. And I'll just zoom in a bit closer. We'll come in very close. Now if you can see that pink star shaped flower, it's coming out of a real, wiery, thin stem leaf. That's onion grass. And I'll show you more about that in the box below and links to a page on our website with photos closer up. Okay, thank you, bye-bye.
