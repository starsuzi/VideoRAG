 Hey guys, so today we're going to show you how to make a caramel chocolate fondue. And this one happens to be a coconut cajeta which is caramel fondue by hard like armor. Yeah. So we're starting with coconut milk which we actually whisked together so it's nice and smooth. It often comes out with a little cap of coconut cream on top. So you sort of treat this like you're making dulce de leche. Exactly. Sweet. You sweeten it. Ooh, I love that. For on the pan. That's nice. It sits in there. Can I try it? Sure, go for it. I love doing this. Oh, you do. Yeah. Nice. It's my secret talent. And I believe we put some salt in as well. So this is three quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Ooh, that looks pretty. Yeah. So now we basically just reduce this until it gets really thick and dark. And you don't want to stir it frequently. It takes 15 to 20 minutes. So our cajeta has thickened and darkened. And actually if you take a spoon and run it, it cleans a trail for a second before it heals which is what hard like armor says. Yeah, I would love that. Yeah. Take a great description. So. And then we're going to add some chocolate. We are here. Do you want to do that? Yes. Very finely chopped chocolate. And you're supposed to let it sit for a second. But you know what? It's pretty hot in there and we chopped it really finely. So we can go ahead and stir it in. Yeah. Oh my god, it's so beautiful. It's like chocolate marble. Mm-hmm. Now we're going to add some vanilla. Mm-hmm. Follow the bison dark rum. We're using gausling, which is really. Yeah. And then I'm going to get ready for the next very important step. Prepare yourself. Prepare yourself. Alright. So it looks nice and smooth. It looks beautiful. So we highly recommend a nice dark salty pretzel. We went through the rigorous testing process. We found the salty, crunchy pretzel. Yeah. It's really good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh my gosh. It's like a toffee chocolate pretzel. Mm-hmm. So good. And the coconut con comes in at the end. Yeah. Delicious. Fantastic. Thank you, Heartless Commer for a great recipe and a great breakfast. Mm-hmm.
