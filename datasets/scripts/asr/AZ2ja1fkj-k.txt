 This is Mindy Macatosh Shutter and I'm going to show you how to prune a Gerber. Now, any time you buy a Gerber a day is either pruning should be part of your maintenance that you do on a weekly basis. And you will need to remove leaves and flowers when they're diseased or deadheaded. So let's begin. We're going to need a knife and or a pair of scissors and depending on where the location of the plant material will depend on which one of these tools that you use. Now, any yellowed or diseased leaves or leaves with holes in them, you will need to remove at the crown and make sure that you take any plant material off at the crown. Also, make sure that the cut is at an angle and not straight across. While Gerber should not be watered from the top down, any time that moisture sits on a cut that's been cut straight across, we're running a chance of that area rotting. If it's cut in an angle, the moisture will simply run off. Now, once you have removed any diseased or spanned flowers and leaves, make sure that you dispose of them properly. If there's not disease involved, you can simply put them in a composting facility. If there's disease, make sure that you throw it in the trash because putting it in compost will just cause additional problems next year.
