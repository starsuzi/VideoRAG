 Hi guys, this is Leah Sermon from Davedow.com and today in natural and night I'm going to be showing you how to make one of my favourite dinners which is a tabooly. So here are the ingredients that we're going to be using. In here I have a cup of ground almonds. I haven't skinned them or anything, I've just put them in a food processor with an S-blade for a while and they ground down to this lovely powder. So you don't need a nut grinder or a cup of ground almond grinder. In here there's one chopped scallion now. I'm feeding this to my family including small children and they can't really take heat. If you can handle more heat, something like a red onion, you could use a red onion or just more scallion if you wanted to. In here there are about four or five, no five chopped small-ish, medium-ish tomatoes. In here we've got, hold on I need to smell this. Right, parsley. There's parsley, a small bunch of chopped parsley. And in this bowl, the pre-pink bowl, we've got the juice of half a lemon, a tablespoon of egg, a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and some extra other little. In there we'll mix them up, like a kind of a vinegarette type dressing. In here is a small bunch of coriander that's been chopped up. There's about three quarters of a good size cucumber that's been diced and half an avocado that's been diced. And all of these lovely ingredients are going to be combined to make tabooly back in a moment. And here we have the finished product, a lovely, raw vegan tabooly made with tomatoes, coriander, parsley, cucumbers, avocado. A nice vinegarette dressing and very quick, very simple, very delicious. If you make one, I hope you enjoy it as much as I will. Take care and stay healthy. Thank you.
