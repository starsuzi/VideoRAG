 Our homes can have VOCs, volatile organic compounds that pollute the air. These can come from dry cleaning, cleaning products, carpets, even your furniture. There are some plants that can help you take care of those pollutants indoors. I have a few recommendations for plants that are going to be easier to care for and that are going to stick around longer. This one right here is a piece lolly. It thrives in low light. It's easy to care for. I like to have this sort of tucked away in one of the corners in a main living space. And I want it in the main living space because it's cleaning the air for us where we spend the most time. This is a pathos. They do okay if you over water. They do okay if you under water. They pretty much live. It's hard to kill them. And these will trail over and look really nice and full over time. And they're great at cleaning the air. This, the succulents usually need not very much water, but they need a lot of sun. And then a zzz plant is great in high humidity areas so you can keep one in your bathroom and just the humidity from taking a shower will keep it happy and healthy. So I hope you found a few options that may work for you. They will not only improve the air quality in your home, but also keep things nice and green. And that is the six home type. Shhh.
