 Carmelized onions are one of those magical ingredients that can transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. Start with sliced onions, a saute pan, olive oil, medium-high heat. You want a big pan so the onions have room to do their thing, and make sure you have plenty of sliced onions. They're going to shrink down significantly when caramelized. Hit them with some salt. This will draw out the moisture. As they cook, they'll first get soft, then juicy. And then this concentrates and they begin to brown or caramelize, making them sweet and delicious. It'll take a while, like 10 to 15 minutes. Stir occasionally and enjoy the process. Give the pan a shake every once in a while. Feel free to add some water to release those caramel colored bits of goodness on the bottom. Keep going and going until the onions are tender and a deep golden brown. If you want to be fancy, add some wine or liquor now, or at the end for extra flavor. Always taste what you cook. Get some seasoning if needed. Done. Following these simple steps will give you an awesome onion garnish that makes everything taste better. Try them and see.
