 Hello, Hocktubers! Today project will be how you can make foldable light box and I'm gonna show you how you can build it at home. For cheap and easy steps so can anyone make it and believe me, if you are video or photography creator you will need this foldable light box. Stay tuned! Everything that is used for making this foldable light box you can find in your local store and will cost you almost nothing. You gonna need this white cooking foil and I choose this kind of cooking paper because if this foil gets dirty you can easily clean it up and it's waterproof and also known as reusable non-stick paper. Next you gonna need some kind of soft metal wire. Why soft? Because we gonna bend the wire to make the frames for our light box. Besides the cooking sheet and metal wire you gonna need white zip ties and couple of new denume magnets. This light box will be 50 by 50 cm and first you need is to make 4 frames out of metal wire that I described at beginning. 4 frames 50 by 50 cm and 1 piece 50 by 30 cm. This frame will be for the top of the box. Now when you made all the frames we gonna take the cooking sheet and cut equal pieces for every frame. To remind you this cooking paper is non-stick so you can't use clear tape or similar. We gonna use staple to fix the sheet to metal wire frames. With zip ties you gonna join all pieces together and the new magnets will be used for holding the frames in place and making this light box foldable. This isn't light box if you not have the right lights so using LED white strips or using these portable flash lights are just basic setup. Here you go it turned out pretty cool foldable light box made out of cooking paper, metal wire and zip ties.
