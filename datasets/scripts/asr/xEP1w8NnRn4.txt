 Today on the domestic geek, I am super excited to share with you an incredibly clever and very effective way to prevent your guacamole from going brown. All you do is take your beautiful fresh guacamole and pour half an inch of water over the surface. Now I know this sounds little crazy, but because avocados are made up primarily of fat, the water will literally sit on the surface and prevent any oxidation, which is what causes avocados and guacamole to go brown in the first place. So be sure to give it a try, you'll buy yourself at least 6 to 8 hours of glorious green guacamole. When you're ready to eat it, simply pour the water off and mix in any remaining moisture. And look, the good stuff stays green. If you've ever wondered why avocados go brown, you should definitely check out this video. It explains all the science behind it.
