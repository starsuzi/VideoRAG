 Hi guys welcome back as Lisa today I'm sharing with you how I made my Z Gallery inspired foam mercury glass kendel stick holders and I'm just using four glass kendel stick holders that I purchased at Dollar Tree a while back so I already had these so I didn't need to purchase anything I'm using some E6000 to attach them together to create larger kendel stick holders you'll also need some either looking glass spray paint or some mirror effect spray paint and this is after 24 hours of letting the kendel stick holders dry so I'm going to be using mirror effect and I also have a spray bottle with vinegar in it okay you just want to shake up that spray paint for a minute or so and then just spray it in burst just to get a light coverage all around the kendel sticks holders you're going to need to do multiple coats of this and in between you're going to be spraying it with the vinegar all over and this is what gives it that mercury glass look I'm just dabbing it with that paper towel and that's how it looks when it's finished with multiple coats of bond and I'm just letting some of that vinegar sit for just a minute at the top here and then I'll block that away but I do want to zoom in so you guys can see how it creates the mercury glass look and that's a shot of them close up they're finished and there they are they are all done and they're all set on the table I would like to thank you guys so much for stopping back because you can see too you're always welcome
