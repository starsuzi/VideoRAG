 Hey guys, Jen. What's up, dudes? And welcome back to another Roblox video. Today we are playing Bubblegum Simulator. The game just came out. It has 114,000 people playing. We count big, these people's bubbles are. Wait, I want to go in this bubble. How come my bubbles are so pathetic? No, Jen. What we need to do is all we have to do is like ice cream simulator. We just blow bubbles until we fill up. All right, our bubbles are actually getting larger. All right, and they make this so we can jump higher. Like, I'm jumping a little bit higher now. I'm getting my bubbles. I'm gonna sell it now. All right, so we go over here and we have some money. And then there is a chup over here. There is gum inflators that we can buy. All right, let's check out the gum. All right, so there's a bunch of different kinds of gum. And it says it makes your capacity higher. So this is like the backpack, I guess. All right, so right now we have 50 coins. We need 175 to get the stretchy gum. All right, and then if we go to flavors, okay, so flavors make it so you blow more bubbles, but every blow a bubble. There's a donut bubble, I really want that. The race is on. We need 3,200 cooling. But good-bye. All right, the race to 3,200 has started. Okay. My bubbles look so sad. No, it's really pathetic. Look at your little tiny bubble. Everyone else has these massive bubbles. I know, how are they so big? All right, wait, I'm blowing. Okay, just sold my bubbles. All right, so it looks like the most important thing is to get the actual flavors. All right, so we need 175 to get the next flavor. No, isn't that for the kind of gum? I think it was for both. Wait, hold on. Let me walk. All right, so yeah, gum, it's 175 for the gum. But the gum is basically a backpack. Okay. And then you're right, it's 175 for the flavor too. We have so they're both 175. All right, I only have 118. I have 150, I'm winning. Wait, 168. Oh, one, 200. 180, I'm buying it. Okay, so which one are we buying? The gum or the flavor? All right, get the flavors because they're going to make it so we can blow better bubbles. All right, so we'll get the blueberry flavor. Wait, some people have pizza. I know, it's kind of gross. Yeah, I don't want to pizza a bubble gum. They don't sell that at the start for a reason. All right, so the money is flowing in. All right, here we go. Yes, I'm up to 75. All right, so we need over 3,000. I know, this is going to take a while. I'm up to 100. 25 and the next backpack first. All right, yeah, the gum backpack. Yeah, I think we should do that. It's 175. I have 155. Okay. Okay, here we go. We're like beast money mess. 175 and I'm buying it right now. Me too. All right, so gum. Then stretchy gum. 175, just bought it. All right, you think it comes bigger? Bigger bubbles? Yeah. Oh, I get it. So the more room you have, the bigger bubbles going to blow. Oh, okay. Look at the other persons. Oh my god, this is actually really cool. Oh, and dudes, I wanted to let you know before we get too far into this, I've been subbed to Jen's channel for two days. It made my thanks giving better because it let me know that she put up Thanksgiving videos. And it was amazing. I even belled her and belled me. I was like eating a turkey. It was awesome. I suggest you guys hit her bell and subscribe as well. Yeah, that would be awesome. But you would love to have you. All right, have you here. I'm chewing gum with us. All right, so the race is on F-240, what do you have? I feel like our bubbles are just so pathetic compared to everyone else's. Okay, I'm not 270. Wait, you have to stand on this long enough for it to actually sell. Wait, should we just like stand here and then just do this? This might be like faster. All right, now I'm going to beat you the whole facet away. All right, so wait, the second thing to buy, is it like 500 or something? All right, let's go check really quick. Oh, you check for us. All right, so for the gum, we need 400. Oh, right. For the next one, and for the flavors, we need, oh, it's 500 for the pizza. All right, good thing you did that, because I think I'm going to have 500 right now. No. I have 474, aren't you? I think we have to jump into the clouds. There's like, wait, there's stuff up there. Wait, is there like something that will help us? There's like a person up there. I can't get that high. You're jumping up, do you see him? Yeah, see people like sitting in the clouds. Oh my god, wait, if you get like the right angle, it goes up so high. Wait, oh my god. Stop up there. We need to get up there. Wait Jen, so our first pet eggs we can buy are 250. Oh, okay. I'm buying one. This is my help. Okay. Oh, it's just like pet simulator. Oh, wait, what is it? I have a doggy. Okay, I'm going to buy it. All right, okay, so how do I, how do I use him? All right, so how did you buy him? All right, so I went up to the pet eggs. Oh, the pet eggs, okay. Oh, and then you equip him after, and I guess he helps you out. In some ways. Or... Wait, what? Oh, I got the Easter Bunny. Oh my god. Now how do I put him out? All right, so go to your pet section on the right. Right. Then we equip him. All right, so we just have this little dude. It looks like OE helps you get more money. Oh, okay. Oh, I'm looking at him popping. All right, so they have two staff. They have a bubble stat. They have a money stat. What does yours have? Oh, hold on, let me check. All right, so you just have two of both? Yes. And then there's zero in two. Not so much worse. All right, okay. I'm selling my stuff right now. How much money do you have? I have 366. I have 398. All right, wait, I'm going to pass you though. All right, here we go. I've got... Wait, come on, 500. Wait, I think we could buy something else right now. Over 400, right? I think it was the gum. Yeah, we could buy the extra stretchy gum. All right, I'm going to buy it. All right, see, I'm going with the other strategy. And I'm going right for the pizza gum. I don't even think I want the pizza gum. All right, you're never going to reach a gum. No, I'm disgusting. I've got four bubbles now, Chad. I've got four bubbles too. Oh my god, your bubbles get huge. Oh, it's massive. Not really. All right, it looks pretty big today. All right, here we go. 110. You bought the pizza gum? Yeah, do you like it? No. You mean, ew. My favorite gum in the world. I don't know why the stores don't sell it, Chad. All right, I am up to 200 gold. What do you add? I'm going to buy it. I'm going to buy it. I'm going to buy it. I'm going to buy it. I'm going to buy it. I'm going to buy it. All right, I am up to 200 gold. What do you add? I'm at three. Four, 88. Four, 88. We are going to beat, maybe? Beat it, you right now. All right, at the pizza one's 500, I think I'm just going to buy it. All right, I think it's really helpful. All right, I am up to three 80. Oh, wait, so you said it's 400 to get the better, like, stig. Yeah, I'm going to get extra stretchy gum. It's 400. All right, I think I have to go for that one. All right, so flavors. I'm buying the pizza one's 500. All right, here we go. Oh, so we have up to 100 capacity with this one. I can't wait to get the donut gum. Oh, taste gross. I got pepperoni in my mouth. I'm going to taste so cheesy. No. What's cheesy gum? All right, all right. Just a reason they don't have a cheese flavor. I realize there's no way I can beat you because your pet is so overpowered. Maybe you should go buy a new pet right now. No, I'm about to get 3,200. All right, I am at 2868. All right, so you know what I'm going to do, right? What? I'm going to buy the donut because I think I can afford it right now. All right, wait, you have enough? I have enough. Oh my gosh, I'm buying it. All right, I need to see this. Okay. All right, I've got... Okay, come over here. 3,000. Oh my gosh, it's adorable. Oh, that's the best donut ever. I love it. All right, wait, I'm going to have it too in just one second. I'm up to about to hit 3,200. Right? But, sell please. Here we go. All right, I'm buying it. So now if we go to the shop, we're not favorite. Oh, we get plus 10 bubbles from this one too. I'm getting plus 12 because of my pet. Oh, we should get new pets then. You know what I'm thinking? We should probably get the next pet, which is 3,200. That's so much. Can I just get like a decent one? But I already have 1,100. It's not going to take that long. All right, wait, I'm going to get a cheap pet and it's going to be yours. All right, so there are 250. All right, I want to buy one of these. Give me a rare one. Let's go. I hope you get another dog. Oh, I got the bunny. Oh, you did? Wait, the bunny's way better, right? Yeah, the bunny's a lot better. All right, so the bunny, I want to equip that. Oh, you hit a multiple equipped. You can? Oh, this is awesome. Oh, I'm going to go buy more. Wait, this is so sick because if you have a bunch of pets, you're going to get so many more bubbles and money. I feel like I should probably get a bigger backpack. All right, I'm just going to get like 10 pets. Oh, I can't. All right, third pet coming in. All right, I'm going to buy the extra chili gum. All right, I got a $1,200. Oh, wait, no, I can almost afford the epic gum. Oh, wait. I'll just wait and buy that one. All right, I need to get more, but I have three pets now. Oh, okay. All right, let me buy this. All right, I'm going to go get a fourth pet. All right, I can, are you serious? Yeah, I'm going to get so many buffs. All right, let's see what we get this time. All right, I just bought the epic gum. I'm kind of sad. I have three doggies. I guess the dog is the most common one. I know. Oh, and I can only have three out of the time. All right, the bunny is way better. So it's kind of sad that I have all dogs. All right, so I need to get better gum. All right, so I am saving up. I'm going to buy the next best pet. It's going to be amazing. All right, the one that's $3,000. Yes. All right, okay. Oh my god, I'm getting money so quick now, because I owe my dogs. What backpacks do you have? Because I have 300 space now. Oh, it was $100. It was like $1,000 to buy it or something. All right, I've got $934. How much does this pet? Oh, look at this person's pets. They have a kitty I want that. Oh, I want that too. Which kind of gum do you have, Jen? I really need a bigger backpack. I have the every gum. It was like $2,200. All right, I'm going to pass that right now. Okay. I'm getting so much money. I've got so many doggies. How much money do you have? All right, I've got right now $1,700. All right, I have $2500. All right, you're going for the pet? I'm going for the pet. All right, okay, let's do this. All right, 1900. I feel like you're beating me really bad. All because you've got a body. I'm sorry, I hate the dogs. I hate you. Don't say that they're cute. We love you, Pat. I hate you. I can almost afford the next pet. All right, wait, it's Braggers. Braggers much? All right, I'm buying the epic gum. I'm going to go buy it right now if you want to come watch me hatch it. All right, okay, I do. I'm coming. I can chew gum on my wall. I'm very talented. All right, ready? All right, okay. I hope I get the rare ones. All right, I'm excited. So what's up? I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. I got the rare panda. Oh my gosh, this is the best day ever. One of the stats on him. Okay, let me see. Oh, he has five coins. Four bubbles, two gems. Wait, it even has gems? I don't even know what those are for. Oh, he's adorable. I'm so poor. Seven, please, give me bubble gum. All right, okay, I'm just be smoothing 1,300. You're going down. You're going to get a new backpack. Yeah, I've got the epic one just like you. Oh, okay, so you should be getting plenty of money soon. All right, yes, sir. Oh, you're getting like millions because you have a panda. Someone's down very salty. Yeah, you are salty because I have so many doggies. All right, I'm 19, 100, I'm crying inside. I haven't taken you so long to get money. Poor. I don't have an army of amazing things. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. I'm going to get a panda. Oh, my God. Yes, I hit the wrong one. There's got to be an army of amazing pets. How much was the egg? $3,200. No, I need out. $2, only. Oh. I don't need it. Run, run. Alright. I don't want to waste a moment. Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Try another... I don't want to do неё. What? A common wolf. Oh. It's a dog but stronger, basically. Okay, tell me the stats. One bubble. Three coins of two cents. Oh. I think he's cute. Take him out. All right, I got a little wolf you see. Oh, look at him, he's adorable. Oh, I'm gonna cry. All right, let's figure out what we want to buy next. Should we look at the flavors and see if there's anything cool? Okay, yeah, let's look at the flavors. There's a watermelon one for 10,000. I want that one. Oh, look at Swirl, 44,000. Oh, I want the watermelon. All right, wait, that's the best one in the game so far. The game just came out. All right, I kind of want to get the watermelon. Although I really like the donut. I don't really want to replace it. All right, I'm raising you to watch your melon. 10,000, it's on. It's 10,000, all right. It's 10,000. Bad luck. Do you? Wait, oh. It says, discover the floating islands. Oh, can we jump? Oh my God, we can jump really high now. Oh, you're right, we can. Wait, you can jump a lot higher than me. Wait, we can get coins just by walking around and stuff. Oh, okay, let's do that. And we can jump into the clouds. Look. Wait, how are you jumping that high? Wait, you can't jump that high? I can jump that high. Wait, maybe it's all my pets. Maybe it is. Or maybe because I've been jumping more than you. I can barely jump at all. Really? So if we can get higher into the world, this is what it looks like. If we get high enough, we can unlock portals to different dimensions. Oh, okay. Wait, you know what it is? What? If you chew more, you could jump higher. So if you have like a lot of bubbles in your mouth, you could jump higher. Oh, wait, you're right, I'm jumping so high now. Oh, we need to get more capacity so that we can jump higher. Alright, let's buy a new backpack. Alright, okay, it's not. Are we planning a money right now? We? Well, I do. Alright guys, we've been blowing bubbles for so long. We have lots of money now. We're going on a shopping spree. Alright, so do you want to get the pet egg first? Yeah, let's get the pet egg first. We're going to get the spotted egg. Alright, here we go. I saw someone with a pig pet, I really want it. I got a polar bear to see me. Oh, oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god, I got a mouse. Jen, okay, so it's not as good as the one you got. That rare one you got, but it says it gets four bubbles and two gold and it gives three gems on this one. That's really good. Okay, so I got the mouse. It gives three bubbles and two coins. Alright, doesn't give any of the gems? No gems. Alright, so mine is a little bit better than yours, so I've up to my team a bit. Alright, wonderful. Okay, Jen, so what kind of gum can you save if we're saving up for? Okay, so it is the super duper gum, 8.35 thousand. Alright, okay, so this one, it looks amazing. Okay, a lot more capacity, 1,000. What now is in bubbles we can store now? Alright, so we're going to be able to jump so high and then we still have enough flavors to get by watermelon. Yeah, it's just going to be gorgeous. Okay, I just bought it. Alright, so now I've got it equipped. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to blow bubbles and we're going to try to get into the sky, I guess. Yeah, I really want to jump on a cloud. Okay, Jen, so the race is going to be the first person to get to the floating island to unlock this portal right here. Alright, it's on, let's go. Alright, so if we blow these, okay. I'm jumping so high right now. Alright, wait, this is going to be epic. Oh, I banged my head on a cloud. Let me do, oh no. Alright, a little bit higher. Alright, so jump like this. Oh my God, there's trampolines. There isn't your old one. Oh no, oh no. Oh no. Oh yeah. Oh man, this is insane. I don't know what I'm doing. I need to find another trampoline. Wait, oh my God. And then, just jump over here. Wait, another trampoline right here. I'm just there. Oh my God. Oh, a trampoline is right here. I won. Yes, I just made it sort of. I'm here. Oops, I want to even, there's a treasure chest. Ooh, what is that? Ooh. Was it good? I don't know. Oh my God, give us 15,000 gold. Oh my God, that's amazing. Wait, you have 25,000 gold. Oh, 25,000 gold. Wait, I wonder if we can get even higher, Jack. Let's just keep jumping. This is still fun. Wait, so this is such a cool way to get money, too. All right, I'll raise you to the next island, whatever that is. No, hi, too. All right, okay. I'm gonna land. Okay, so just keep on jumping. All right, there. I don't know where I'm going. Oh no, oh no, falling. Oh no. Oh no, wait, okay, I'm up here. Okay, jump over there, yes. All right, where's the trampolines? I'm not finding any more trampolines. Oh no, I'm going all the way to the top. No, listen, yes. Oh no. Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, me too. Oh no, I'm at the bottom. Are you all the way at the bottom? Almost. Wait, okay, are we still trying to get up to the second island? Yeah, we're trying, too. It's not bad, Easter. All right, I'm back up to the first island. Oh, wait, okay, okay, that's good. All right, jump on this. No. No. No. All right, oh my God, this is so hard. So we need to look up before we jump, I think. Oh, wait, I just got confused. This is so weird. I thought someone else's bubble was a trampoline. I was trying to jump on it. Jump on their bubble? Wait, I can't reach. Oh, right there. Oh no, I don't even know where you are compared to me. It's hard. We're going to make it to the top of this whole thing, guys. Here we go. No, no, no, no, no, I don't think we're strong enough. I don't think so, you know. I'm going back down. I'll be right at the bottom. Go back down. Let's go buy some more pets or something. It's so much money. All right, I'm going to hit sell, so I go back on a mat. Wait, I think we can almost afford the most expensive pet in the game. Wait, how much is that one? Wait. Oh, it's 35,000. There's a giant trampoline right here. Oh, that must be a good way to get started. Oh, my God. Oh my God, it brings you up to the first island. All right, so we need 35,000 gold so we can get the best pet, right? That's the next race. All right, okay, I'm already at, wait, how much am I at? 23,000. Okay, I am at 28,000. You're cheating. No. Wait, so we're going to have the best pets in the game? Yes. But, Chen, should we go in this portal? Because we unlocked it. Oh, we should. Let's go in the portal. Wait, let me sell my food. Oh, okay. All right, okay. I'm going in. Okay, what is this? Is it like a obby or something? Oh no, it just brings us back to the island. Wait, that's really useful, so we don't have to jump all the way up. Oh, and wait, this thing responds. It gives us money in 12 minutes. Oh, so we just come back here in 12 minutes. Oh, wait, okay. We'll be back in 12 minutes. Oh my god, that's awesome, actually. I love that. All right, so we need 35,000 gold right now. I'm up to 29,000. Wait, what is it, 30,000? Oops, you had a button, John. Don't be thinking. No, I almost just left the game. Oh no, it opened again. I'm like cheating hard, more. All right, so I am at 26,000. What do you have? I'm at 20,000. Oh no. All right, I want to do it again. I'm just trying to catch up. I really want to buy the pig though. Wait, look how big your bubble is. Look, the pig is right over here. Oh, we should get a pig. How do I get him? It's so adorable. All right, I'm beast modeing right now. Matt, 28,000. I'm looking to see which one the pig is from, because there's like little pictures. All right, yeah, it's hard to tell though, because I'll actually show. I think it might be, no, no, it's not that one. Is it the cheapest one? Is it? Okay, it's definitely not the most expensive one. It might be a robux one, Jack. The cheapest one, I think. It's really? I think it is. You always want the worst pants. All right, I'm up to 32,000. Oh, I'm up to 32,000. Almost 32,000. All right, wait, wait, 32,500. So this is up to 35,000.
