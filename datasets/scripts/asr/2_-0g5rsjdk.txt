 Alright, what I got here is a tree trunk that I'm going to try to remove. As you can see I dug out all around, you can see where the roots are. It's got a nice hefty one right down here. So what my plan is to get my chainsaw and cut off these roots as many as I can get. I'm sure it is more underneath that I can't see but cut them all out and then pull them out with my tractor. So I'm going to give it a try and see what happens. Now what I'm going to try to do is clear some of that dirt out so I can put the chain under that root. Thought I had a breakable hole on it! Oh God! I don't know. We will see. That was obviously more a route down there. When you get all four tires spinning, how much else you can do. But it did move it. I just have to do some more digging. Well, I found a few more. I cut those. Who knows, it's probably a tap route right in the middle. It goes straight down. But I'm going to try. Well, you know what? That exposed a lot of route down there. I can probably get with the chain. It's probably just a couple more. Oh, I'm going to try. Oh, I'm going to try. Oh, I'm going to try. Oh, I'm going to try. Oh, I'm going to try. Oh, okay. I'm going to try this again. How the pretty good size route there? The head had been, I don't know, three to four inch diameter. I'm going to try. I'm going to try. Well, thankfully it didn't have a tap route going down the middle. Not really. The one I cut off must have been the tap route right here. This is the one I cut off. So the rest were all going out. This was a live oak tree. But yeah, I'm glad it's out. Now I can start working on my garden out here. Alright guys, thanks for watching. I mean, what you think, what I did right or wrong or whatever.
