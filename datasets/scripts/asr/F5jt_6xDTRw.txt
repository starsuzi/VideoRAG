Let me sell them at $10 to see if there's a market. You know, to see if I could even sell shirts. Which I'm sure hopefully I can, man. Hopefully I can. $10 a share of my website. They pay $4 shipping. So they're going to be paying a total of $14. And I'll make a $5 profit. Not bad. I will have to sell about 12 shirts to break even on the transfers. So that's the goal. To sell 12 shirts. Can I do it? I mean, I don't know. Hopefully. But you know what? It's going to take 11 days for the transfers to get here. But with the power of editing. The shirts just got here now. So I'll post some of my designs on Facebook and Instagram. And you know, this white's always good to do feedback. So you know what people like. But I'll be honest, just because they like it doesn't mean it's going to sell. It's a good way to find out if you have a good idea. Number one. Some people were selling this one right here. So number one. Right there. Number two, as you could tell. So. Boom. Number three. Some people. Number four. Number five. Number six. Number seven. Number seven. Number eight. Now, people. Number nine. Number, let me see. Number ten. So you get them out. And then the second popular one. Was. And the last one. 12. People were filling this one. Is number two that's good? He's going to be a next design I'm going to make. Yo. Sorry, I look kind of bummy today. You know, my get a fresh haircut soon. By any way, though, guess what I got in the mail. Guess. It's saying 325 degrees for seven seconds. Medium pressure. You got pale immediately. And you only need teflon sheet. That's like a plan. Got to run my. Ampress, he press. Now only do I love this he press. I love the company. They're taking care of people I ran. And I got to show my appreciation. Where's the pressure? It feels pretty good. You know, one thing. I don't know, man. It's probably just me, but one thing I noticed is that. It's just me. It looks so small to me. You know what? I'll be honest. I have a good thing. And bad things about it. I have an expression. It's good because it's convenient, quick. And of course, the price. I also heard some complaints. That it cracks. When you watch it, it fades quick. I'm applying to this being it. And then I applied to a couple shirts. And then I'm going to do a wash test to see if it actually fades or not. What do you guys think? I know for some of you, it has. For some of you. You guys are not there? But I'm going to find that. And I'm going to give you my bad answer. What do you think? Tell me. Very first thoughts. First thoughts, I love it. Yeah. Why? Because I've never. He never said it before. That's good. He's got nothing. And where are you thinking? Tell me. Very. Where are you thinking? Tell me. First thoughts, I love it. Yeah. Why? Where are you thinking? Tell me. Tell me. Where are you thinking? Tell me. First thoughts. I love it. It starts, I love it. Yeah, why? It looks clean. That's it? Yeah. You know what? It might do you but actually. Wait, wait, wait, wait out. They're eating peel right there. So I'm gonna do another run and hopefully but the fill to it. Dinner. It feels thinner? It tastes thinner. Any complaints? Honestly, I don't think that we're having complaints on this one. Well, this is this but I mean. It's because I mean. It didn't stick with her, you said. Yeah, this is it. That could've been me. Yeah, exactly. You know, it didn't mean they're all like that. I could've just been. Oh, my beautiful. It's not true. Okay, now my princess. Do you like it? Yeah. You love it? Yeah. Yeah. All right. You want to wear it? Yeah. All right, I just said it was it. I mean, we got a winner right here. I'm just gonna align the shirt on the heat press so it could be straight. And then I just applied the heat transfer. So I need four fingers. So right here. So I'm making this scratch on it. I'm gonna tick tick tick. And I know. You see it? Right there. I'm using the bottom with armpits. Right here. Then up here maybe. You know, if I had to sweep away, it would be way better. There you go. I think that's pretty good. Keep pressing it. Pre-press it. Way clean and peel. Way cleaner. All right. I just did this one. What do you think? Pretty straight. I kind of thought you know what? That might be a good position. Right there. So once again, I keep pressing straight. I'm gonna do a four fingers from the collar. So four. See, I'm making this scratch right there. That's a free May night tip. I got a charger for it this time. And then, I'm also not having this scratch. I know, roughly where. I see you do measure armpits. And then, it's an immediate peel. The reason is, I know why the first one, this one, that ends in my right. Cause I was feeling it kind of slowly. The feel for it. It could be bigger, but I mean, there's gonna be one within the cool. The feel for it. Amazing. I love the feel. Like I feel just a little bit of it, but it's not too thick. And it's white. I like how it's heavier this. Just because I like you guys. I'm gonna take this and that's just that. Over wash test. We're actually gonna wash the shirts to make sure. There's no cracking, peeling, not fading after our first wash. I'm gonna side this one. So you guys know it's real. Let me see, I ain't even gonna look. You guys ready? Yeah. We're gonna wash it. If everything goes good, which hopefully does. I'm gonna post on my social media and say, today and today only, you're gonna get a raise up the producer for $10. And if you only want today, I'm assigning. We're gonna assign this one right here. We're gonna do. Yeah, fine. There we go. So, let's go wash it. One thing I always like to do is turn my shirt inside that when I wash it. And I would like to take a quick second. Just a little second to thank today's sponsor, an armor class 10. You guys think I'm the only one who uses the FMF for the first time? I'm gonna put this on the screen. I'm gonna put this on the screen. You guys think I'm the only one who uses the FMF expression? Nah, they do too. They contacted me saying, Reyes, we want to be one of your sponsors, because we also use FMF expression for our business. I'm like, no way! They two started clothing brand with FMF expression. Whether niche are gamers who play D&D, Magic, Warhammer. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, it's a right. You don't need to. They got their business unlocked. That's the niche, the gamers. And they use social media to sell their shirts. They have over 45,000 followers on Facebook. So you know they're doing something right. They also go to conventions that are targeted to their niche, where they make shirts on the man, meaning they buy the transfers with their designs, take the play shirts, and a couple of heat presses, and only when someone orders a shirt, do they make them. That's a really good idea. Like, going to the SWATME or the VAT, buy a whole bunch of transfers, take a few heat presses and shirts. Hey man, I'ma try that out one day. I asked Mark, the owner of Armor Class 10, if there's anything he'd like to promote for this sponsor. And he said, all he wanted to do was share this story. And if anybody has questions about starting a business, with heat transfers, how to come with designs, or how to start making money going to conventions, to contact them. Because he's helped several people start their own similar business. I asked him, how did it all start? He started six years ago, because he would always begin in funny ideas for shirts. He started selling them on Zazzle and Cat Fade Press. But since that commission wasn't big, he decided to make the shirts himself. And now, as a few employees working for a part time, as well as some graphic designers. I asked him, what is his next step? What will take him to the next level? And his plan is getting a license from a game company to let him make their shirts. They ain't marked. Hey, he has a plan, and he's gonna make moves. Once again, he's not trying to sell you a product or a course. He honestly just wants to help as many people as he can. Just how I'm trying to help you with all the free nine-night knowledge I provide. Thank you, Mark, for reaching out. And I truly appreciate how you just want to help out people. Make sure to go check them out. Alright? Moment of truth. I watched them. I tried them. Can't my brain? No complaints. No cracking, no feigning. Some people didn't say that. They cracked us in their first watch. These didn't. You probably got a bad batch. I don't know. Hopefully you can contact them. But in my experience right now, they came out great. I did change the procedure a little bit. Instead of seven seconds, I did nine seconds. Instead of meeting pressure, I did a lot of pressure. In my personal opinion, this was a success, and I found a way I had to make my merch. Oh, and guess what? I posted this shirt. I'm like social media ready? I got some sales. I'm gonna be sure to with you. I'm gonna give you the best answer. And once again, FM Expression is in pain. They didn't even give me an affiliate program. You believe that? No, no, this can't code. But when I come across a good business, I'm gonna share it with you. Because these? This is good results.
