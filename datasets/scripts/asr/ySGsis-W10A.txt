 Hello, I'm Michael Ebert, the inventor of the Omega Poth Roll-in Clean Self Cleaning Litter Box. In this video, I'm going to show you how it works and how the Litter Box cleans itself. To start, I'm going to open it up and just add some litter. To open it, you just slide these tabs and the top lid soft. I'm just going to add some litter to it now. You can use any type of clumping litter. Clumping litter works really well in this product. Just simply pour it in and fill up the Litter Box to about two inches. So I'll just level it. As you can see here, then you put about two inches or so of litter in the bottom of this pan. I'm going to do a quick simulation with you to show you how it works. I'm going to take some water. I'm just going to pour it in here in a couple of spots. Spot here and a spot here. That's just to simulate the cat doing its business in the Litter Box. I also have a couple of toy balls that I'm going to put in here as well. They just simulate the feces that the cat has done in the Litter Box. So I'm going to close it up. I'm going to give you a quick demonstration of how easy it is to clean and how to clean it. Then you can see for yourself. To clean this Litter Box, the Omega Paws self-cleaning Litter Box, you simply roll it like this. Slide out. Your roll it back. You do a little bit of a counter roll and that levels the clean Litter again in the bottom, as I'll show you. Then you just simply open up and plug the tray and voila, everything is in there. The balls, the toys that I put in there and the two clumps of Litter and voila, your Litter Box is clean. I'll open it up and you can take a look inside. You'll see the Litter is nicely clean and nicely leveled again in the bottom of the pan ready for the next use.
