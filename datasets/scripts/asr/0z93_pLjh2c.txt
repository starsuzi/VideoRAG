 Hey costume fans, Laurie here from Halloween Express. If you know your Greek mythology, you've obviously heard of Medusa. She's that seriously ugly thing with snakes instead of hair. But what you might not know is that before Medusa was cursed with all that ugliness, she was actually considered to be one of the most beautiful women in all of Greece. Today in this video, I'm going to show you how to create an amazing costume look that's been inspired by the myth of Medusa. Come on, let's get started. The first step in creating our Medusa look is to begin with a concealer and I'm going to choose one of the lighter shades in our concealer wheel and a damp sponge and just blend that in and cover up any darkness that's underneath her eyes. The next step is we are going to apply a foundation to our model space. I am using Celebrate in Light Vage but you will want to match your own natural skin tone as closely as possible. Okay, then we're going to do the eyes and we're going to begin with Creamy beige eye cream by Mamron and just brush that all over her entire eye area kind of as a base. Next I will be using Chestnut Brown eye cream also by Mamron and we are going to apply that and blend it well into the crease of her eyes. Okay, next I've got the Green Eye Cream by Mamron and I'm just going to layer that at the top of the brown. Kind of an align but blended at the same time. I want the green color to be there but subtle. Using the green once again we're going to now line underneath her eye.
