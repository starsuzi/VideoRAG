 My name is Wayne Phelps. I'm a professional magician and this is expertvillage.com. I want to show you a really cool coin trick. It's a nice little vanish and not a lot of magicians use it. I call this a flip vanish. This is what it looks like. You flip it up into your hand, catch it, take the coin, and just quickly give it a little rub and the coin vanishes. Do you see it happen? Do you know what happened to the coin? You're absolutely right. I've got the coin finger palm over here in this hand. This is how it works. What I do is I take the coin and rest it on the tip of my middle finger and my ring finger. I flip the coin up and into my hand. That's the hardest part right there. Now I'm going to do this slowly for you but understand when you perform this for a spectator live, you want to do this as quickly as possible. What you're going to do is pull your left hand up, allowing the coin to drop into your right hand. As soon as it slides out, the left hand quickly snaps over and closes and at the same time the right hand snaps over and closes. You can classic palm or finger palm the coin. The right hand drops to the side and relaxes. All the attention is now on your left hand which supposedly has the coin. Give a quick jiggle or two and then vanish it. That's a flip bash.
