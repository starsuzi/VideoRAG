The BuildAbear Workshop Stepping Station comes with everything you need to build your very own furry friends.

To start, remove the lid from the Stepping Station. Carefully add one bag of Stepping into the machine. Put the lid back on, and remember, always put the lid back on the machine before turning the handle. Choose a furry friend, both a brown furry friend and pink furry friend come with the Stepping Station. You'll find the opening on the back. Make sure to keep the safety zipper in the open position until you're ready to stuff your furry friend. Slide the opening over the nozzle of the Stepping Station. Gently twist clockwise and over the rim on the nozzle to ensure the furry friend is secure. Now it's time to stuff our furry friend. Hold the BuildAbear Stepping Station at the base and turn the handle slowly to start filling. You'll know when to stop turning when your furry friend pops off the nozzle. With your fingers, push the stuffing into the arms and legs. Put the furry friend back on the Stepping Station nozzle and continue to turn the handle until your furry friend pops off the gap. Use your fingers to finish stuffing the arms and legs. Then start working on stuffing the head. If you find that the stuffing is stuck at the top of the machine, you can turn the handle in the opposite direction to grab more stuffing. Continue to stuff until the machine is completely empty. Right a wish on a paper heart, fold it in half, and place it inside the heart lockage. You can also add some paper accessories. Slide the locket inside your furry friend. Make sure no stuffing is in the way and carefully zip up the safety zipper. You can use a paper clip to help open or close the safety zipper as well. Make sure to ask a parent or guardian for help. Your wishes are safe with your furry friend. Dress, accessories, and don't forget to name your furry friend. Choose a name and personalize with the birth certificate.
