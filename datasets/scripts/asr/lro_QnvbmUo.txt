 Hi, so right now I'd like to show you how to make Sun Tea and it's actually not very complicated. I learned how to do it though from Wonder how to from the secret you me verse and I want to thank you me for the beautiful comic strip she did of it and so basically what you take are a couple tea bags and I might be I have like a different version probably than what she did but it's based off of it and you put it in like some of my cold water at the beginning of the day right now it's about it's almost 11 and I meant to start earlier and you just put the two tea bags in you can also probably do loose leaf tea if you put it in a strainer and you set it in and you want to do something that you know isn't gonna get too bitter throughout the day because you're gonna leave it in the sun for about six hours so so I chose get my show which is a combination of brown rice tea and matcha matcha there you go and I'm gonna put it in my garden next to my beautiful pumpkin well it's right there I'm so proud of it just flowered yesterday and I'm proud of this garden basically because it really was just like nothing it wasn't even a garden it was just a much a hard dirt and finally it's letting me grow things in it hopefully the cats next door don't come in and keep on the tea thank you
