 Hey guys, this is Barbeque Smoke Girl. Welcome to my YouTube channel. Today I'm going to show you how to butterfly a chicken. First off, what you want to do is take the whole chicken and a lot of times it comes with gizzards and hearts inside the cavity of the chicken. I just take that out, set aside for some chicken stock and then I rinse the chicken off before I start cutting it. The process is fairly simple. You just need a good pair of chicken cheers like these right here. You can use any regular kitchen scissors or a very sharp knife and the idea behind it is to cut alongside the backbone of the chicken and you can kind of see it to the skin and that's what we're going to do right now. Again, as I said, just save the back for a chicken stock. It makes a really good chicken stock. There we go. Just cut that fat off. Set that aside and you can start from here and just flip it over and that's how you would butterfly it and just like that. What I like doing is I can get two separate halves when I throw it on the grill is to cut down the middle here. What we're doing now is just do that. On the breast. There you go. Two separate halves. There you go. That's how you butterfly chicken. Thanks again guys for watching my YouTube channel. It's always a appreciative you guys stop and buy and check me out and please stay tuned for more videos to come.
