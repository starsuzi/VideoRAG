 Hi everyone today I'm going to show you how to make your very own gluten free basic floor blend for your chapati, rotis, prata, spuri, it's the same blend and you can blend it with millet and a lot of other stuff. Okay let's get started. So I have here is the Sergam floor or the Joward floor and this one is the Amaran also called a thraj kira from those of you from India and this is a tapyaka floor. You can also use cornstarch but I like to do tapyaka floor and there is a tam gum. It's what you want to 3-4 ingredients that we're using today and let's see how we can mix them. First of all I'm going to take one full cup of Sergam floor or the Joward floor over here and then put it in a small bowl and then I go the one full cup of Amaran floor. So here we go and then the third ingredient is some tapyaka floor. I'm going to take 3-4th so you can even use it 3-4th cup of tapyaka floor and then the last thing is our Zantam gum. It's always one teaspoon of Zantam gum for our binding issues. And then I just put this away and then you take a whisk or a mixing batter and you just mix it in like a ladle mixing it in as much as you can so they all mix in. And there you go that is your blend and then I usually store it in our glass mason jar or if you have a glass bowl like this I just put it in a glass container and I call it GF floor so I know I'm ready to make my puris chapati's prattas. Here is my blend and now you may want to shake it up once you put it in and here we go. Thank you.
