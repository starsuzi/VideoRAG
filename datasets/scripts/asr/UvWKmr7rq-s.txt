 If your problem is that the washer finishes the cycle but the top still above half full of water, do the following to check and see if the washer drains or not. Place the drain hose on a bucket. Set the timer on the spin cycle and pull the knob to turn the washer on. If the washer won't drain or just trickles out, check for an obstruction to the water flow. Remove the clothes from the washer. Clean the washer against the wall and remove the front panel. Open the washer door. Use a plastic container to remove the water from the washer. Remove as much water as you can. This way when you remove the hose from the pump, you don't have water leaking all over the place. If something is inside of the pump, most likely you will see it because the pump is kind of transparent. Use a towel to catch any water leaks. Remove the hose clamp. Use a flat screwdriver to loosen up the hose. Remove the hose and place it on top of the towel to catch any water drips. Use the wire hook to fish out whatever piece of clothing is inside of the pump. Install the hose and the clamp on the pump. Make sure the clamp is nice and tight. Now let's check the top to pump hose to see if there is any obstructions. Remove the clamp, the hose and anything that is obstructing the water flow. Pull the hose back and the clamp. Make sure the clamp is nice and tight. Place the hose on the bucket and turn the machine on. See how nice is raining now? Those were the places that obstructions could happen preventing the washer from draining out the water.
