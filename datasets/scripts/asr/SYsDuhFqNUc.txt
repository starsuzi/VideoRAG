 Namaskar, My name is Chef Harpal Singh Soki and I am telling you how to make Kesar Badam Kulfi and it is very tasty For that we need milk powder, sugar, cream, Kesar, small lychee powder and cut almonds First of all, the milk is hot so that it is hot and because this Kulfi is ready you have to add milk powder you have to add more milk powder and add sugar Kesar small lychee powder and mix all these things well Now add milk to the milk and after that remove the milk Now remove the milk and take it out and take it in a bowl or press it in the same way Here I have taken it in a bowl and place it in a room temperature but first you have to add cream as well as cream because it is hot so it will be very hot and the taste will not be the same and let's make it cold When the milk is hot and put it in the milk add almonds in hot milk and the almonds will be soft and you will get this Kulfi in the same way After adding almonds keep stirring the milk and cool it This Kulfi milk is made from the same way when it is on a room temperature then take it in a bowl and pour it in this way pour it in a big way and make it thin and then add it in a bowl and keep it in a deep freezer to set it to keep it in a safe place that Kulfi is set in this way and keep it in a separate place If it is not a stand then you arrange it in a bowl and keep it in a separate place and keep it in a separate place so that Kulfi is in a separate place and it will take 6-8 hours to set it after 6-8 hours you can enjoy the K-Shar Badaam Kulfi I have made it this way
