 Okay, we're at a nice rolling boil now. I've got six main loxters here. I'm going to be boiling. You want to just turn them away from you. So if they're tailwiggles, those splash water towards the back of the stove. Here's one. Here's the second. Just kind of gently drop them in, upside down. And I've removed the rubber bands from their claws because I don't want that rubbery stuff to boil. And there they are. And then I'll cap until it starts to come to a rolling boil again and then I'll remove the cap. And I'll post the cooking times to use on this as well. But it's pretty easy, straight forward. So I hope this has been helpful. Thanks for watching.
