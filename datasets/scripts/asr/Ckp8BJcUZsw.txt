 Alright guys, this is a quick video how to remove I guess pesky little decals that you don't want in your VHIC lamp anymore. This works for removing decals off your glass because obviously you're going to be using a razor blade. And it's very simple, only takes some out of a few minutes. Just take your razor blade and go in at an angle and slowly kind of push up and it'll remove the decal off your window. Once you get a corner up, it should be of take and just kind of pull it right on off. Very simple process here. Just make sure you keep that razor blade to get angle. You probably want to use when you're done some adhesive remover just to kind of get out of the gunk. As you can see it's kind of left on the window off your vehicle. Goof off works pretty good. But as you can see it just comes off real easy. And that's pretty much it. Just take all your little pieces and just clean them off your car. But I would recommend using some Goof off in a good microfiber rag or something like that just to kind of get that adhesive off your window. But fairly simple process. But just check it out. If you've got any decals that works great on glass now on paint, it may be a little bit more difficult. I guess on paint you would just use something like Goof off and maybe your fingernail to kind of lift up the decal and get it off. But anyway, hope you enjoyed the how-to and it's fairly helpful to everybody.
