 Okay, a little bit of ice. Some eggnog. A little tiny touch of whiskey. Okay. Stir. A touch of cinnamon. Oh wait, no this isn't your extra pudding. This one's for me actually. Okay, your extra pudding. So here we go. Very easy. We do one and a quarter cup flour. Okay. A little bit of salt. This one about a teaspoon. One. Two. Three. Alright. Now for the recipe you can use a cup and a half of milk. I'm going to use soy milk. Why? Because I like it better. It works just the same. One and a half. There we go. And I'm going to mix this well until it's a nice smooth batter. Okay. So that's nice and smooth. I'm going to transfer it into a smaller container. Okay, set oven to convection roast. 425. Grab your soft, a muffin tin. Grab some vegetable oil and pour yourself about one teaspoon of oil inside of each hole. Okay, just a little bit. Okay, now the muffin tin actually gets heated up in the oven. So you want to heat that up until the oil inside of the muffin tin is nice and smoking hot. Okay, so they've been in there for about 10 minutes now. The oven's preheated at 425. So now I'm going to take this out very carefully. And that oil is smoking hot. Okay, so now I want to look nice and hot. I'm going to add my batter. Fill each of these only about halfway up. Okay, and then it goes back in the oven. So in the oven they're going to go from something that looks like that. Pow! To something that looks like that. And there you have some really nice Yorkshire puddings.
