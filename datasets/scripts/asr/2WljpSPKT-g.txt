 Okay, today's little side video is sort of radio related, sort of components related and it's again part of the vintage radio series and some people probably wonder how do you clean things? Well there are several methods of doing it and my favorite for cleaning flux and for cleaning general dirt and gunk off circuit boards and and components and basically degreasing is isopropanol, isopropanol alcohol and as you see you buy in five liter barrels and it's very very cheap for this sort of quantity there's no point in buying you know a hundred mill bottle it's it's just you know not worth your time and effort and the cost of shipping it if you're going to buy it by a decent sized tub you'll be surprised at what you can do with it and you don't just use it once and throw it away hence this rather disgusting looking thing next to it so let me move that off the bench and put that back underneath the bench where it lives and what have we got here right now normally I have a glass jar with isopropanol alcohol in it and I keep it at the back of the bench and whenever I've got some screws or bolts or components or washers or bits that need cleaning I throw them in the glass jar and give it a good shake every now and then and Bob's your uncle and of course all the dirt comes off and you then think well you know you fish out the bits that you want which is fine but then you're left with this gunky looking fluid so my method of making it nicer again and get in rid of the gunk is quite simple you have the top of a fizzy pot bottle I think this is old your little zone brand cola flavour drink naturally we have a Greek yogurt pot but any pot you can cut a hole in and balance that in the top will do and here we have some paper coffee filters and literally all this is is you get the whole jar of stuff once you fish all your components out that you've cleaned and that goes in there pour it all in there and let it drip through and you can do it once twice three times depending on how gunky a solution is and what you end up with apart from having a smelly room in the house because obviously the fumes of an open pot of isopropyl I think they smell quite nice but yeah you know some people don't like the smell some people are worried about toxic chemicals but hey you know this is us you're talking about so yeah once it's all drained through you're left with a filter for the gunk so I can tear this open and you can see that it is gunk and it is just rubbish in there it really is disgusting now this could be quite toxic because it will be flux it will be oil it will be grease some of it that's you know 50 60 70 years old where chemicals might not have been environmentally safe shall we say so that's all junk on what you're left with after putting it through the coffee filter is a rather dark looking sample and as you see it's not clear because a coffee filter is not the the finest filtration device in the world it's it's designed to let coffee through and keep solid matter out so your isopropyl is no longer clear it's still got dissolved fluxes and what have you in it but for the purposes of cleaning stuff and for example let's see if I got something that we can clean for example one of these capacitors for general cleaning you know you just dip your cotton bud in it and you can get the muck off like that and away you go as they say nice and simple there you go if you want to dry it off you can either use the other end of the cotton bud or you can use bit of kitchen towel bit of anything you like the only thing I would say about using isopropyl on component markings is it takes them off so if you've got something that you want to keep markings on then don't use isopropyl just use water and though that sounds ridiculous when you're dealing with electronics but you know this is a solvent this this will take off a surface so there we go nice quick and easy how I clean things using lovely chemicals and how I reuse them over and over again until that goes to a color where I can't filter it anymore and then it gets disposed off correctly down at the waste recycle center in fact I put it in with the old cooking oil and I could say I could run the car off it but I won't because that would be illegal but no I don't run the car off it it goes to recycling center and they can dispose of it along with some of the other hazardous stuff that you have when you do electronics thanks very much for watching and I hope you found this interesting see you again for the next video bye for now
