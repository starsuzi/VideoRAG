 I'm David King, I work for a Scotch farming. We're going to be building a set of wooden steps onto concrete porch. This is what Vince come up with here. He's got a band attached in just an inch and a half on the inside of these posts. That way the end of the sport will be covered up by the stunger. So we're going to get some anchors on those. Anchors in the tent, check it out better. I'm going to dump you shit. You can't do what it's worth like. You can't do what it's worth like. I'm going to get it in first. Hey, that hose. Put your ass in behind you, boy. I'm going to get it in first. I'm going to get it in first. I'm going to get it in first. I'm going to get it in first. Seven, eight, seven, three, six, eight. What he did, he measured, find out how far out the steps is going. He leveled over, measured down. That's the vertical rise. We used that step calculator to come up with seven and three sixteenths on seven steps. Once we lay this straight out, we cut the top, we cut the bottom. We're going to stick it up here and make sure it marks some level before we cut them all out. All right. How's everyone using the frame and square? Metal on the run is 10 inches. That's what the made dates. The rise of calculator is seven and three sixteenths. What you do is you get your marks, you just advance the lines up through that. Set the steps, start us here. There's no special cuts at the top or the bottom, so it's pretty easy to lay it out. We're just using a seven or quarter inch circular saw, frame and blade on it. I'm cutting over to the... No further than the mark shelf, and I'm going to finish him up with a jig saw. Set up a pattern. He's at the mark one of the three. Strangers. Marked them all, I'll fit one pattern. They will have another all-be identical.
