 One of Brawman's most notable features is the ability to adjust your handbag strap. The majority of Brawman straps can be made longer or shorter using the bag's micro-adjustable buttons or double-out functionality. You can adjust your strap in four simple steps. Step 1. Slide the leather collar away from the button. Step 2. Pull out the button and adjust the strap to the desired length. Step 3. Push the button through the appropriate loophole. Step 4. Slide the leather collar back to ensure the straps are secure. You can also adjust your crossbody bag into a shoulder bag using the same four steps. Your Brawman bag is now ready to wear.
