 This is Fiona for Fiona's Restaurant YouTube channel and I'm going to be talking about making bread sauce for Christmas. Now bread sauce should be nice and rich and creamy and delicious and I think sometimes people either don't put cream in it and it becomes a bit of a milky watery mess. So the tips I'm going to give you will ensure that you have perfect bread sauce. You need to get a whole onion peeled and then get about two or three and then more cloves are cloves, cloves are garlic cloves and stick them in the onion. And then you put the onion into the pan cover it with milk and simmer it till all the lovely flavour from the onion and the cloves infuses with the milk and that's almost it. Just take the onion out and you need a pile of bread crumbs because what you don't want is a soupy kind of goo. You want a nice thick creamy rich bread sauce. So plenty of bread crumbs, day old bread or whatever, fine bread crumbs and pile it in, salt, pepper, little bit of butter and start stirring it through and stirring it through and stirring it through and then you want to add double cream and right at the end a big thick knob of butter on the top, stir the butter and the cream into the bread sauce and then serve
