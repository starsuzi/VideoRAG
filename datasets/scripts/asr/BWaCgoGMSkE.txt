 Welcome to Cake Playground where it's all about the fun. This lesson is on how to make modeling chocolate. This is great candy clay you can use to make flowers and other decorations for cakes and cupcakes. The material list is short. All you need is 12 ounces of candy melts and 1 1-quarter cup light corn syrup and some plastic wrap. Put your candy melts into a bowl and then put them into the microwave for a minute. Candy melts and chocolate will burn really easy in the microwave. So take them out after a minute. You notice when I took them out here they looked like they had not melted. But as I stir them you'll see that they are partially melted. So after you've stirred them a little bit put them back in the microwave for about 30 seconds and then stir. And the heat from the bowl will cause the candy melts to melt on themselves. When the candy is completely melted add 1 1-quarter cup light corn syrup. Be sure and scrape all the syrup out of the cup. Then stir in the corn syrup and you'll notice here how it goes from liquid to kind of grainy and thicker as you stir in the corn syrup. This is what it's supposed to look like. Once the corn syrup is thoroughly mixed in you're going to put the modeling chocolate onto some plastic wrap. So put the ball on the plastic wrap, wrap tightly and you're going to let it sit for a couple of hours to let it cool down. Once it's cooled down the chocolate will be a little bit hard when you unwrap it. So what you do is take a little piece off and knead it in your hands. The warmth of your hands will cause this to come to a texture kind of like Play-Doh. Now you can use this modeling chocolate for a lot of things including letting your kids play with it. And here's some ideas. So come back to cakeplagrond.com and see some tutorials on fantasy flowers and roses and even a beautiful swan. And there's all kinds of other cool lessons at cakeplagrond.com.
