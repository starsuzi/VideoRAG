 So in this video I'm going to show you how to get clear headlights and this is a simple easy way to do it that anybody could do at home. So you only need two things in order to do this. Here's one the headlights that I recently just did it to and here is the other headlight. It might be hard to tell because it's a little dark out but this headlight is pretty cloudy and this one is clear. So what you'll need for this is a rag and this case have an old black sock and WD40. Pretty simple you do with spray. Once you spray it just wipe it. And instantly the light becomes a lot more clear than it was. And you lose that yellowish tinge. Alright that's all for now. Thanks. Bye.
