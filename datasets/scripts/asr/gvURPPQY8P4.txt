 Hey Cupcakes, it's me! Today I have a very fun and exciting video. Today we're going to be making two different things. We're going to be making this cool puppy plush pillow and it's going to be for Teddy. And we're also going to be making this build your own built-in bear. This one's a cheer bear with our build your bear kick. All right, so let's get started. So we're going to start with this puppy plush pillow. So let's open it. I've actually made one of these before. So this is going to be easy and fun. So it comes with all the different colors of the fabric and for the puppy. And then here is the stick where you put in the fabric into the pillow, instructions and then we have some of the nose I think and then the eyes. And then we have more of the fabric. So we're going to open up the fabric. All right, so we're going to open this and we're just going to read what color number is there. I so we're going to start off with number uno and this is the first color. So now what we're going to do is we're going to put this through and we're going to look for the ones. You're just going to put it in. Yep, that's it. Now to number two, which is light pink and we're going to be doing that in the ears. So I think we're going to get so far. This is a really cool and good DIY for kids and they will keep you really busy. Really cute. So now we're going to do the dark purple and this is number three. Which is the light purple. So on to our next color which is white and it is number five. This is so relaxing. I'm turning next color. Our next color is black and it is number six. On to our next color which is white and that's going to be the rest of the puppy. All right, we are done. We're done with the puppy but now we need to put on his eyes and his tongue. So we're going to put on his tongue. Let's put on his eyes. Here's our doggy. Okay, so we're done with our first creation on to our last creation. Our last creation is going to be the um do it yourself. Build a bear. So um if you haven't seen my last build a bear video make sure go check it out. I had lots of fun making it. So today we're going to be making a cheer bear. So let's get our station. And let's open up our kit. All right. All right, so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to open up the stepping. We're going to open our little station and we're going to put all the stepping in it. We're going to open up our bear. Oh it's so cute. It comes with its little outfit. The bear, it's a rainbow bear. It comes with the top. So it's cheering its skirt. It comes with the two little pom-poms, a hard market and two cute shoes. And as well it comes with like some stickers to go with the bear and it has its birth certificate. This is going to be lots of fun. All right, so we're going to put the bear. We're going to open the bear. So I'm kind of weird but we're going to put it inside here. And we're going to turn this. So now we're just going to push the stepping into its legs. Guess one cup of cakes I just figured out that one leg is longer than the other one. Now we need to push them stepping into her arms. So we're going to put the bear. And then we're going to put the bear. And then we're going to put the bear. And then we're going to put the bear. And then we're going to put the bear. And then we're going to put the bear. And then we're going to put the bear. And then we're going to put the bear. And then we're going to put the bear. And then we're going to put the bear. And then we're going to put the bear.

Ok this is exactly what you like the most out of the bear. And then we are going to see what that bear does to us. And then we have to put the bear. make a wish and put it into the bear. So I'm gonna make a wish but I can't tell anyway. Because that's how dreams work. No, we don't. What is it? No. Okay. Now we're gonna dress up the bear. So let's put on the skirt.
