 So now let's talk about how to handle an arterial bleeding wound. With arterial bleeding wounds, the blood will be shooting instead of running out or dripping. The blood will be bright red instead of dark red. With an arterial bleed, the person can bleed out in anywhere from 90 seconds to 5 minutes. And with the average emergency response time being anywhere from 7 to 12 minutes, there is an obvious need for us at home to be able to effectively stop an arterial bleed. And there is. It's called Quick Clot. Take a look at your package of Quick Clot but don't open it. Only open it when you need to use it. I'll show you what it looks like and demonstrate how to use it properly. Quick Clot is truly miraculous. It was originally designed for military use. Because it is so effective, all military personnel now carry Quick Clot in their packs. When the time comes to open this package and use this product, this is what it looks like. Quick Clot is a mesh bag, kind of like a hacky sack. And it's filled with small beads of caolin. Caolin is the secret to Quick Clot's success. So, how do you use it? Due to the severity of this type of injury, contact emergency medical services immediately then treat the wound by packing Quick Clot directly into the arterial bleed and apply pressure. In most cases, the bleeding will stop in only 5 minutes. Continue to apply pressure until medical aid is obtained. And here's how it works. As the caolin absorbs the blood, it expands. The expansion creates pressure and the pressure stops the bleeding in just minutes. Caolin also contains a mild disinfectant and can be left in the wound for up to 24 hours.
