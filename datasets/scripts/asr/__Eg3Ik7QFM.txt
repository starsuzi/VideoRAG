 We're Adam and Joanne from InspiredTaste.net and welcome to our kitchen. We're making our baked oatmeal with strawberries, banana and chocolate, an easy and fun breakfast. Let's do it. Preheat your oven to 375. Grab a dish and generously spray with cooking spray. We'll need some strawberries, so give them a rinse. Then, haul and slice enough strawberries so you have about one cup. Now, grab some walnuts, measure out about half a cup and give them a rough chop. Next up, the chocolate. Give it a chop or just use chocolate chips. You want about a third of a cup. Now, let's start putting things together. A large bowl, add two cups of oats, a third cup brown sugar, and one teaspoon of baking powder. Next, add about one tablespoon of orange zest. A teaspoon of Chinese spiced spice, and a little salt. Now, for the good stuff, half of the walnuts, half of the chocolate, and half of the strawberries go in. Give it a stir, then move on to the wet ingredients. You'll need one egg, three tablespoons of butter, that's been melted, and two cups of milk. Add the malt together, add a couple dashes of vanilla extract, and give it a whisk until combined. Slice a banana, then assemble, put all the oats into your baking dish, top with nuts, chocolate, and the rest of the strawberries. Add the bananas, then pour the wet ingredients all over. Now, just shimmy or shake that dish so the milk mixture goes throughout the oats. Bake 35-40 minutes, or until the top is nicely golden brown, and the milk mixture has set. You could serve the oatmeal now, or add a little extra brown sugar to the top. Set your oven to broil, and cook about one minute until bubbling. And that's it, just grab some bowls and serve warm.
