 This tip is all about twisted wire. When you run two lengths of wire close together, for example by twisting them, it creates a dead zone for the dog fence collar. So you can use twisted wire for applications like connecting your transmitter to your outer boundary wire or protecting flower beds in the middle of your yard. There are two methods you can use to make twisted wire. The first method is the quickest and easiest, but it requires that you use a power drill. Simply loop the wire around an anchor point, then take both ends of the wire and securely place them in your drill, like this. Add a slow to medium speed, twist the wire until you can see that it will remain securely twisted when you release it from the drill. Be prepared, when you first release the wire, it will unravel just a bit. If you don't have a power drill, you can use a couple of common household items to create your twisted wire. Take either a cardboard tissue holder or a small piece of PVC. Bend your wire right in the middle and thread it until just pokes out the top. Use a pen or even a socket wrench to twist your wire. Keep in mind that the longer or heavier your wire, the stronger your base in twisting device must be. That's it! Quick ways to make your own twisted wire, rather than buying expensive pre-made twisted pair.
