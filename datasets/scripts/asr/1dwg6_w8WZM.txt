 What's up you guys? It's absolutely gorgeous out here. Today we are bringing the kitchen outside. We're going to make five gallons of Nickelodeon slime for an awesome cause to make your slime you're going to need. Jello, baby shampoo, water, flour, and some tools. So the first thing you're going to do is add 12, 3 ounce packets of green jello to your bucket. Now you're going to pour an entire five pound sack of flour into your bucket. Pour an entire gallon of water into your mixture. Stir up your slime mixture until all the lumps and bumps are out of it. We want smooth slime y'all. Slowly add the remainder of your five pound bag of flour. Do this by adding a couple cups at a time and stir in between, making sure that you have a smooth, consistent texture. Since this slime is still a little too thick, you're going to slowly add water into it until it's a consistency that you like. Add one cup of baby shampoo into your mixture. Stir it all together and add green food coloring until it's the color of the mixture. I added it to the entire bottle and now you have an entire five gallon bucket of slime. If you want to watch me pour this entire five gallon bucket of slime on my head, check out this video right here. Thank you so much, Arrow Angie, for showing me the slime bucket challenge.
