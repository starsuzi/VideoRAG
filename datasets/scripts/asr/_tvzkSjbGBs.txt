 Hi, I'm Sarah from Rez by Sarah.com. And today's video, we're going to show you how to pour paint and make a nice painting. First you'll need some basic craft paint. Even the two bottles for a dollar stuff works great. You'll need water, any size canvas, some school glue, and little cups for pouring the paint. A craft stick and gloves help too. This project gets really messy, so be sure to put down some thick cardboard so you don't get paint everywhere. For each paint color, mix one part water and one part school glue. Be sure to mix up your craft paint first. Then add two parts paint. This doesn't have to be exact. You just want the paint to pour nicely, but not too watery. This is so easy, even my brother could do it. You can do this in so many different ways, but I like to pour several circles of paint around the canvas. I tried to go in rainbow order so the colors don't get muddy, but you can do whatever you want. I like to add some white in between so that it gives a nice marble effect. Looks like there's a big bath, Sarah. It's supposed to be that way. One ever. Take your craft stick and drag the colors like this to add some designs to your paint. You don't want to do this too much, just a few lines in each direction. Now this is the fun part. Tilting your painting to cover all parts of the canvas. It's fun to watch the paint slowly slide along the canvas. Let your painting dry overnight and hang it on the wall tomorrow. Actually, it kind of nice.
