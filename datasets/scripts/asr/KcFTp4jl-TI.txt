 Hey guys, so in today's video I'm going to be showing you my favorite makeup look for high school and this is kind of also like a makeup routine because I've been doing this every day and this is a collab with my friend Bryn or Bindle VDX here on YouTube so I'll have a link to her video in the description. It's just a get ready with me for the first day of school and go subscribe to her you won't regret it, I promise. Of course starting out with a fresh face I'm going to be putting on some moisturizer first of all so my skin's not dry and then I'm going to do my eyebrows with the Anestasia and what Anestasia brow powder and everyone does their eyebrows differently and I know a lot of people don't even do anything at all to their eyebrows so if you have your eyebrow routine down then do that right now and now I'm just concealing my under eye circles and the reason I'm making triangles instead of just doing little streaks is because you don't want to have just a visible streak of concealer right under your eyes so that's not cute. Make sure to put some pressed powder on after you're concealer to set it and to make sure you're not shiny and then I'm going in with my Hula Brown C which is like my all time favorite makeup product ever and I'm just contouring and the eyes a little bit of warmth to my face as well as kind of defines my features and then I'm using a high beam by Benefit and I'm highlighting and I've been really into highlighting lately so I'm just basically highlighting the like highest points of my face I guess just the ones that would naturally be hit by the sunlight and don't forget you don't have to do everything I'm showing here you can wear more makeup or you can wear less makeup it depends on what you want to do so anyway after that I'm putting on some blush and in my opinion I think blush makes such a big difference it just adds so much color to your face and it makes you all happy and cheery looking and then I'm priming my eyelids with Fit Me concealer by Maybelline and then I'm going in with Nooner from the Naked 3 palette and applying that all over my lid and then I'm going in dust from the same palette and I'm just putting that in my inner corner kind of and into the middle of my lid and then I'm taking the Hula Bronzer and putting that in the crease and kind of on the brow bone because I think it looks really pretty and tan looking and then I'm taking Nooner again and I'm putting that on the lower lash line and curling my eyelashes and the last step of the entire makeup look is to put on some mascara and I'm just using my favorite ever and that's it for the makeup. Don't forget to go over to Brins channel and watch her video and subscribe to her because she's one of my favorite people ever and thank you guys so much for watching I'll see you next week. Bye!
