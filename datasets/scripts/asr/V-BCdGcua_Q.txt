 Hi folks, I'm Joe from Premier and today we're going to build a trailer paddock with horse quick fence. I have two rolls of 50 foot horse quick fence, one is in my hands and the second is set up behind me. The set up horse quick fence disconnect the clips at the top. Tide the strings that hold the bundle together and shake it out. Next go to your end post and remove one of the end posts from the netting. Then insert it next to the post of the set up net. Tide the two posts together with your basic shoe string knot. Connect the two metal clips. Start walking out your net throwing your post out one at a time. Insert your line post into the soil. I'm going to tie my end post to the trailer. Make sure the post and the strands are not touching the trailer. It is metal. We are now going to electrify our horse quick fence with a 12B energizer. There is an on-off switch at the bottom of the energizer as well as a fast speed or normal speed switch. Insert the energizer into the soil. Connect the ground clip to the ground rod of the energizer and connect the fence clip to your stainless steel clip on the netting. And turn on your energizer. Once the energizer is turned on you will see a red light flashing. This energizer will flash with every pulse over 2000 volts. But to get an accurate reading take a fence tester. Today I have a five light tester. Insert the ground probe and attach the fence probe to your fence. I'm flashing at 8000 volts. So I have a well energized fence.
