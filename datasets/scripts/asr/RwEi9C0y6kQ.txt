 Hi everyone, so I'm gonna do an update video of the rubber tree leaf. This one over here. A bunch of you guys asked me to do an update and so here it is. It took me a while to do an update because as you can see there hasn't been a huge difference. The leaf is dying a little bit as you can see the edges are drying out. However, I do think that this is the way that it's supposed to go. I think once this leaf dies then perhaps a new growth will begin. As you can see the inside part is doing really well. It's pretty healthy. I continued watering it, you know, maybe every three days, something like that. I should mention that this is about five or six months old now. It has a really complicated root system. When I was repotting it maybe three months ago, when it was about two and a half months old I think. I think, or actually I'm not sure, maybe three months old. It had a lot of roots. There were probably, I want to say about 20 roots growing in and some of them were getting kind of long and it was starting to actually look kind of gross. That's why I didn't want to look at it and that's part of the reason why I decided to put it in soil. Now I can't see it. I don't know, what else can I say? Yeah, it sits really close to direct sunlight. It probably gets about six to eight hours every day. One tip that I have is I have this chopstick here as you can see the wooden one. Every now and then I aerate the soil, which is basically where you just poke holes in the soil. It helps to make sure that the soil doesn't start to get too humid and develop fungi. Every now and then just poke holes in it and then it will help oxygen get through to the soil. To the soil. It will help the soil dry out a little bit better because you don't want to keep it always moist. You want to give it some time in between watering so that the soil can dry out a little bit. Yeah, so this is what it looks like. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask and I'll try to answer them. Bye!
