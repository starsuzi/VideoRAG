 Cromlin water-based bichermen paint will waterproof most masonry surfaces before being covered with soil. Typical uses are on retaining walls and planter boxes before backfilling and for waterproofing timber and posts before contact with the ground. Before applying water-based bichermen paint always measure the area requiring sealing. Correct application referring to coverage rates will provide long lasting results. Water-based bichermen paint is a thick, bituminous membrane best applied with a brush or roller. Prior to application adequate surface preparation must be carried out. This should include ensuring surfaces are clean, smooth and as dust free as possible. All internal corners should be primed with water-based bichermen paint and whilst wet, reinforcing bandage should be embedded. Once the bandage has been installed and dried for an hour apply a full and continuous coat over the entire surface where waterproofing will be required. After two full coats have been applied install a suitable protection board before backfilling.
