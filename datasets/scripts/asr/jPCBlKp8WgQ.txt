 Okay, today I'm going to show you my method of cleaning my air filter. It's a more simpler way to do it. And basically what you got to do is you got to buy a lot of air filters and just clean it once every two, three months. It's a bitch to have to do your air filter every day or every two days, but here's how I do it. So put every single one of your air filters in the sink and I got a lot of air filters. So as you see, I run about for air filters and I got my air filter cleaner, no toil, thanks to a Lee and Big Top risk. Don't recommend a lot of things he says, but that's a good thing. We're going to clean all these with hot water. We're going to make sure they're all perfectly clean. We're bringing it through, getting every piece of the air filter cleaner and cleaner. I do this to every single one of them. All right, then just let them soak out. And you want a hair dryer. Get them all dry. I'm going to let them sit in there for a few minutes. All right. Man, how many oil filter brands and colors do I have? Holy rainbow. All right, now lather them up with your air filter oil of choice. This is what you do. Pour it on here. Soak it all in. Put it in a healthy amount. You want to be able to see the green oil everywhere. You want every single piece of this so it can trap as much dirt so it doesn't go into your engine and blow it all up. With the gallon ziplock slider bakes, slap it in there. One by one. And do that for all of them. And there you go. Ready to go air filters.
