 Okay, what I have here is I have a leak, I've cut it in half and leaks tend to get really dirty especially in the wintertime when they're coming up through that dirt. And what you can see here is you can see that there is dirt on the inside of every leak. So if you just watch the outside of this leak, you are not going to get that dirt off. So what I do is really get it under the faucet and get all of the places that that dirt can hide. Um, unlike what you may have heard, you can really use all parts of the leak. You don't have to just use the white part. This one has a very beautiful white part, but you can use the green part. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. This is going to go into our cauliflower dish. If you didn't have a leak, you could use it on it. The dishes are all gone by gosh, but soon we'll have cup boaches washed. The winter greens are sweeter when it's cold. We keep our diet balanced because modern life's a challenge, but it's many pleasures can't be oversoar. And on market day in our homes town we rise and shine and head on down for the families and the farmers meet and thrive. Because we're taking nature's course we get it fresh right from the source where the bounty of the county comes alive. Where the bounty of the county comes alive.
