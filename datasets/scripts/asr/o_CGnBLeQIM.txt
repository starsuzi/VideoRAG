 What's up YouTube? I just got a new cast iron skillet and I was talking to a friend of mine And I mentioned that tonight I was going to prep it and she said well, what do you mean prep it? She had no idea what I was talking about so I thought if she had a question about it Maybe other people had a question about it too So if you're gonna make a YouTube video and show everybody what I do to prep my cast iron skillet All right, so here's my new skillet Completely unused. It's beautiful. It's a great thing Okay So just so you know first thing I did was I preheated my oven to 350 degrees Okay, so that's preheating right now. I have a towel in the bottom of my sink Because I don't want my Brand-new cast iron skillet to get all scuffed out and I'm going to wash it with a burrow pad Hot, silky water And I'm going to hit the inside of it and then I'm going to hit the outside of it So it really really well the bottom of it Wait for it And this is the only time you'll ever wash your cast iron skillet is when you first get it and you start puffing it Make sure I hit the rim and then we're gonna rinse it well I Want to set it here so it doesn't ruin my so it doesn't ruin my countertops And then we're going to dry it it has to be completely dry Also if you're doing this you want to make sure you don't have a towel that's gonna Leave a whole bunch of flakes all over it I know I picked out a good towel, but you want to be conscious of that you don't want otherwise it'll pull that's not nice Looks like we're pretty good Alright And then All right, so I got the TV a shortening Most people will use Crisco. I Always aim to cook as healthy as possible. This one happens to be USC USDA organic non-jamo verified Fear for life organic superfood the whole nine yards. So for me, this is what I'm using You could use any basic Crisco it'll cost you probably 50% less than what I spent. Okay Now I'm gonna coat the entire pan inside outside The handle everything is gonna get coated in the shortening and you should definitely use a hard shortening You don't want to use like olive oil or some kind of you know, canola oil or some kind of liquid you want to use Something nice and thick All right, I'm gonna hit the outside now I don't know if I heard my oven Click yet, I'm not sure if it's unpreheating, but it's not really a huge deal You're almost done prepping Trying not to scratch my granite countertops You know that glues This can be a very messy process case you haven't noticed Also, I'm using a paper towel to oil this up Mostly because I don't want to put my hands that I don't have a problem in my hands dirty But I don't want to stick my hands in the shortening and then have to I would throw this out if I did that so I'm just trying to save the Save the shortening I guess all right. I think I'm pretty much coated Make sure Looks good I don't think I missed anything alright so now what I'm gonna do is put this into my oven Which is already pre heated It's still bright so it's gonna go face down which I noticed make a lot of sense but you know face down into A baking dish Something just to kind of help me out Because that shortening is going to drip off and I don't want it to drip into my oven. I prefer that it drip into a pan All right, so we are good And I'm going to leave this in here for an hour well, I'm gonna set the timer for an hour And then once that hour is up I'm going to turn the oven down and just let the cast iron skillet cool to room temperature Which at this point at the end of the night. I'm not using the oven tonight I could just leave it in there until tomorrow morning and it'll be fine So that is how you prep your cast iron skillet You end up covered in shortening but it's well worth it and like I said earlier This is the only time you should ever wash your skillet If you end up washing it a lot it ends up getting rusted and it's just not good don't do it And then there's no point in prepping it so only time you have a wash it is now and This is how it gets prepped and it'll take about an hour and then we're good to go Any questions you could throw a Comment below and remember to like comment and subscribe to my channel and hit the little bell and you'll find Find out on you'll find out first when a new video pops up.
