 A natural sweetener that doesn't affect blood sugar levels doesn't feed yeast and has zero calories? Bring it on! This green herb from the sunflower family is grown in South and Central America and they've been using it for thousands of years. 300 times sweeter than sugar a little goes a long way. Even with all this sweetness, stevia doesn't have a high glycemic index because the leaves contain glycosides, which the human tongue registers as tasting sweet, but they don't contain the carbohydrates that other sugars do. Obviously, stevia is an excellent choice for those with diabetes, sugar intolerances, or weight issues, or just simply for folks that want to avoid excess calories. Our stevia powder is a beautiful fresh green, no bleaching or other nasty processing here. Just a pinch of this stevia will sweeten your teas, smoothies, yogurts, and more.
