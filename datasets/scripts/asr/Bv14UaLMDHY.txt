 Hi guys welcome back to these kitchen so today we're going to cook steamed cabbage So for this recipe you will need one cabbage cut up I'll use salt and pepper Crush red peppers In water which I have Water from some ham that I have cooked previously to this so I'm going to use my ham water for my cabbage if For the ones who don't have ham water then you can use just clear water and I suggest add maybe a Table spoon or two of baking grease, you know to give it a little bit more flavor if you like But let's get started So to get started I'm like I said I have ham grease on ham water I'm sorry that I'm gonna use all I'm gonna pull about a cup of ham water And there you don't want to hold out of water the water do not suppose to cover the cabbages You only want about enough water just to cover maybe the bottom of the pan just so won't stick I have some crushed red peppers. I'm gonna add I'm a little pepper And a little salt So So I'm thinking I'm gonna do now is I'm going to turn my eye on about five and I'm gonna let that Cook down and once the cabbage cook down I'm going to stir it and You know taste it because you may have to add like a little bit more red pepper and a little bit more salt to it But I'm gonna let that cook down and I'll be back I Cabbagees have cooked down so now all you want to do is just stir them up And And after you stir them up real good You just place the top that go on and allow it to continue to cook So it's been about 10 minutes and Our cabbages have Cooked down completely They are done As you can see I still have a little water left Which is okay If you want you can continue to cook your cabbage to get the water out or you can just strain it out me I leave a little water in there. I don't leave too much But I definitely don't cook it out because I don't want my cabbages to be mushy. I like sort of like a crunch to it almost so That's the end of the video I Hope you guys enjoyed this video of my steam cabbage Please comment like and subscribe below and thanks for watching Bye
