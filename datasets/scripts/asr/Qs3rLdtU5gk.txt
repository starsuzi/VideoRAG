 Hi, thanks for stopping. My name is Laura. I'm with Weebie Cleaners out of Park City, Utah. And today we'll be discussing how to clean brass fixtures in the bathroom. The materials that you're going to need, I use a facial cleanser and I mix that with water. And then you'll need a dry or damp terry cloth rag. Let's get started. What you do is I just spray a couple of foam sprays on there. It's so gentle you don't even need to use gloves. You could actually just use your hand and wipe over it. I tend to use the rag. Rinse that off. And then with a dry rag, you're all set. That'll take care of any water spots or toothpaste or anything that you've got going. That's how you clean brass water fixtures.
