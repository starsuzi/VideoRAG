 Hi everyone, happy Friday! Okay, so today I want to do a recipe that's been requested by Shane. He asked me to show him how to do a Chinese brown sauce recipe. So when he asked me this question and I was actually thinking to myself, Chinese brown sauce, what is it? So I did some research and then I realized Chinese brown sauce, a Chinese American sauce that's been used in a lot of Chinese American tikka restaurants. Because Chinese cuisine is so diverse, every regional cuisine is different. There really is an base sauce, an all-purpose sauce that every dish has been using it. And then so I caught up different chefs who were in Chinese American restaurants and then they actually told me different recipes. So I kind of just put them all together and I'm going to show you today and how to do a Chinese brown sauce recipe. Okay, about one tablespoon of chicken stock. Two tablespoons of Shaoxing wine. Whoa, that's way too much. Two tablespoons, guys. Now two tablespoons of oyster sauce. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Okay, one, two tablespoons of soy sauce. Good job. Then two tablespoons of sugar. All right, I think I'm almost out of sugar. Here I have about one teaspoon of corn starch water with two tablespoons of water, a teaspoon of sesame oil. Here I'm going to throw in about three stalks of scallions. Just chuck them up. And then here I have some ginger and three cloves of garlic. Now let's just mix it up. And then all we have to do now is just let them marinate. Let the ginger, let the scallion, let the garlic taste go into the sauce. The sauce you can use it for stir fry. You can use for beef and broccoli and also lowne meat. All right, guys. So I hope that you enjoy my recipe for today. If you have any other recipe that you have in mind, don't know how to do comment below and let me know. And I will try to make it happen for you. I'll see you next Tuesday. Bye.
