 This is for Tim Farmer girl and I'm going to show you how to eat a turnip. Now that may seem funny but I didn't know how to eat a turnip. I didn't know how it was supposed to be peeled so I would do a great stir fry and throw my nice turnips in there and it would be disgusting. It tasted awful. Until I found out that you can't just peel the external layer off. You have to go down. I think hopefully you'll be able to see it here. You have to go down to the layer right where you can see the division in color. And I peeled one just a little bit so that you can see how thick of a peel it is. And if you don't get that whole outer part off, it's bitter. This big one here, you can see it's actually already starting to peel off. When I cut the bottom off it just kind of came right off. But the important thing is you can see that it wants to come off. You need to take that whole piece off and there's a good picture of it how thick it is right there. And so I just take the knife peel around the edge. If it's big enough and loose enough, it can just pop right off kind of like you're peeling an orange or something with a little bit of a thick. And it just comes right off. So anyway, I just want to pass along what I learned the hard way. This is pretend farmer girl, sign it out. And here's the turnips. I have some turnips, I have some garlic, and I have some onion in there. And one of the best parts is here all the peelings and I'm taking them out to the chickens. That's so fun that the chickens get to eat stuff like this. So anyway, this pretend farmer girl, enjoy your turnips.
