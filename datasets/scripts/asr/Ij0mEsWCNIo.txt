 My name is David Miller and I'm president of Insects Limited out of Indianapolis, Indiana and I've been a store product entomologist for the last 40 years. Over those years we've developed a series of traps and lure combinations using non-toxic products and alternatives to pesticides. The trap I want to talk to you about today is called the pantry patrol food trap. This is a trap that can be used in your pantry. It can be used in various areas of a food plant or a mill or any place where there are spices or natural food stores. It traps beetles, moss and weevils and very common insects that cause problems to people who store products. This one was invented with a special idea of the biology of the insects that will then climb up into the trap, circle around it and come to a special attractant and this attractant has five different pheromones and a combination of food grade lure oils and then the insects get trapped inside. This is a good trap to use for your homes. It goes into the corners, the insects and then walk to the corners, get into the traps and die inside. Our experience has shown that there's over 20 species of insects that will come to the pantry patrol trap. I always recommend to put the date you put the trap and lure combination out so that you know approximately when it's spent. The pantry patrol trap lasts for two months and during that period of time it stays active for both males, females and some of the immature larva stages. When finished with the trap you can then take it and throw it into the regular trash and all of this is a non-toxic approach that insects limited has put together over the last 40 years. I hope it's something that you'll try and use. Thank you for listening.
