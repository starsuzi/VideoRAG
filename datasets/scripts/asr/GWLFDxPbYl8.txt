 To make our saffron-centred bread sauce you'll need 1 pint of milk, 1 onion peeled and chopped, 2 bay leaves, 2 to 3 cloves, a pinch of saffron strands, 175 grams that's six ounces of fresh white bread crumbs, salt and ground pepper and 30 grams that's one ounce of butter. Pour your milk into a saucepan and add your onion, bay leaf, cloves and saffron and bring to the boil. Once it's boiling turn it off the heat and leave for the milk to infuse for a while. Strain the milk into a saucepan or jug, pour into a fresh saucepan, add in your bread crumbs slowly. Keep stirring over low heat until it starts to thicken up. It should take about 5-10 minutes for it to get really thick. Add your wedged butter, right at the end, make sure it melts, add some salt and pepper, give it another stir and your bread sauce is ready to serve. And that's how you make saffron-centred bread sauce.
