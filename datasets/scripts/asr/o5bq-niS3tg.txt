 Welcome back, I still give you an update of where we are now. We've got the first course of blocks on this foundation. As you can see it's a plenty of room to work because they've over dug the foundation, the contractors before. So we've got this two courses of block running through here now and what the intention is because this wall is going to be rendered, this could be retaining wall. What we're going to do, we've got a ladies' blocks on flat now like so. And when you're doing blocks below ground level like this, it doesn't have to be pretty. You can level that up in a sec. But basically we can better the joints if I'm just pulling up like so. It's just like that. It's just simple like that. If you're watching this there, it's there. Block on flat again. We haven't got one that ready. You can better the joint of the block like this if you want. And then the block on flat. There we are. We'll put the level across this in a minute just to see where we are. But as you can see, it works well. We've got nine inches now and now from here we can determine of how much ground we have to take off this on this side of the garden. We're not quite sure at the moment, but we're having a deep foundation sometimes it works, you're advantage because you've got plenty to work with. So stay with us. We're going to give you a stage by stage progress report on this project. But if you need any advice on the means, I'm going to the website which is www.greentoplandscapes.co.uk. See you soon.
