 Alright, it's Saturday morning about 10 minutes till 7. I just took the chicken out of the refrigerator. What I'm doing is taking it out of the marinade, draining the excess off and lading these pans. I'm going to be ready to put my rub on the bottom side, using this plow boys yard bird rub today. And then I'm going to flip the chicken over and rub the top top top. You see I used two pans. Some of these pieces are really nice. Some of them are too big and I probably wouldn't use them. But that's why I always do two packs of chicken on contest day to make sure that I have enough small sized pieces. Because the smaller and more uniform the piece, the better it's going to look in the blind box. It's going to get your parent score up. That's what we're looking for is all nice. I like to just liberally shake on my dry rub on the bottom side. I want to make sure we get it completely seasoned up. I'll come back in and kind of rub it in on the side a little. Skin sides are most important. That's your show. That's your money side. Let's just really get you taste and flavor from this side.
