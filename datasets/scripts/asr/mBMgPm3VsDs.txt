 Welcome to SuperSimp World's Up Pad! We make super simple things for busy families like us. Yay, we are going to make a Jurassic Park cake! The things you need are a humongous dinosaur egg. Two eggs in cakes. Blue frosting, chocolate frosting, and a green frosting. Fondant, and a medicine cup. So let's start! First, frost your cake board. Then put your first layer of cake on the board. Make sure you level your cake. Frost the first layer. Then put the second layer on top. Then trim the edge of your cake. Then cut a small person to make it into a river. You can gently scoop it out with a knife. Then add green frosting. Then put green frosting except the river area. Then put blue frosting on the river area. Then with chocolate fondant, wrap your medicine cup to form it into a volcano. Keep adding fondant so the bottom part is wider. Now I'm going to put the volcano on top of the cake. I'm making little pebbles using titty rolls. And I'm making little balls using fondant. It feels so squishy. This is really fun. Now I'm going to put pebbles on the side of the river. Now the river has nice rocks on the sides. Then add grass on the edge of the cake. My mom made the sign. You don't have to do this but it makes the cake prettier. Then with orange and red frosting, add the lava on the volcano. And we also added dry ice and hot water to make it steam. Thank you for watching Civilization. We'll start crying.
