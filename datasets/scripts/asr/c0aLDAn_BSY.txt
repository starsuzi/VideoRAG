 Socker game baseball practice recess. All of these mean fun times for your kids, but grass stains further close. So today I'm going to show you how to remove grass stains from a cotton shirt. Start by brushing the excess stain off the surface of the fabric. Pre-treat by covering the stain with tide liquid detergent. Let it set for 20 minutes. Then wash the shirt in warm water with one use of tide liquid. If the stain remains, repeat these steps before drying.
