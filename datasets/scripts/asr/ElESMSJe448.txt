 Alright y'all today I'm gonna show you how to prepare some fiddle heads. Let's get a shot of them here. The fiddle head is pretty much like a new beginning for a shoot, a fern to start. What that'll do eventually is unravel when it'll be it's leaf. So I'm just gonna take a few of these. Let's see, I've got some over here. I don't want to take them all off of one plant because it's not gonna grow. Okay, so that's what they look like. And this is a wild onion. You can use this, it's just like chives. Take it and cut it up and put it on your potatoes and stuff. It's really good. It's in a pretty strong but it's good. So alright, we'll see you back at the house. Alright y'all, got these all rinsed off. They'll have like a little bit of a brown paper on them. So I just go ahead and rinse that off. I've got just a little bit of extra virgin olive oil. And we're gonna just fry these for a few seconds. And then turn them over and we'll be back. Alright y'all, I've got some sea salt here. We're gonna add that. Rindle saut√©. It's a little bit of black pepper. Okay. Then just a little bit of fresh lime, or lemon juice. And then we'll just let that reduce for just a minute or so. And then it's time to plate up. Okay, well this is what it is. I'm gonna give it a shot. That's amazing. I've never had them all this great. No wonder people pay good money to get them. So try it out guys.
