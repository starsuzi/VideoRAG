Crushed ice not cubed ice crushed and we're gonna shake it You're gonna shake your full ice. So let's get busy with it. You add a half ounce of Malibu A half ounce of Captain Morgan Spice drum Sailor Jerry's will work too. That's fun. A half ounce of the Cardi 151 We're gonna save the darker one for the end.
