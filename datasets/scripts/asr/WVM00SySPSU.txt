 Alright, how you doing? My name is Nate. This is Max and we're going to show you how to catch a little golfer here. These are pocket golfer. You want to fill that about half full? Max, come on. You've got to keep the dog from running ahead of you and scaring it. Alright, I've seen them a minute ago out here. We're going to go check where he is at. See if we can see him. I think I see him. The main thing is you've got to find his hole. Max, where is he? Where'd he go? Where's he go? Hey, what's up? Did you find him? Where'd he go? Where is his hole? We all wonder. Is he down there? Let's see. Yep, I bet he's down there. Max haunted. What you want to do is you want to tip this jug down this hole and they're going to shoot up the jug. Hold on. Where's he going? Where'd he go? There he is. Got him. You see that, guys? Where is he, Max? Where is he? That's how you catch a pocket golfer, guys. I'll save you the rest of the video here when I flip him out and the dog attacks him. Max, is he in there? You want him? Thanks, guys.
