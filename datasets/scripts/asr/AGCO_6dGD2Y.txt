 Hi, it's Marshall John here and today we're in the basement workshop and I want to show you a quick and easy way to make a plant press. So without further ado, let's get started. For this project you will need plywood that is about a half inch thick, four carriage bolts, four washers, four quarter inch bolt, four wing nuts, four quarter inch bolt, and a five-sixteenths drill bit. I bought a sheet of plywood from Home Depot that was two feet wide by four feet long, and then cut two pieces with the dimension of 12 inches by 10 and a half inches. If you wanted to do a larger press, you could also use the dimensions of 20 inches by 12 or 13 inches. And then what we're going to do is we're going to come up to the corners of our boards and probably about five-eighths of the inch end is where we want to put our holes. So measure down five-eighths right here, and then five-eighths right there. And that's where we'll drill right there. So we'll do that all four holes. And then we'll drill our hole. If you're not sure that you measured all holes exactly the same distance from the edge, it's not a big deal, but you will want to just label the corners and this button A, B, and so on. And you can do the same thing on the bottom. A, B. To put it all together, you're going to take it and stick a bolt through each one. I have a little saw in this in there. And then this is why you probably label. I have a right down there. And what you would do is you would put your press right here in the middle between all of your bolts and stick your topboard on, line up all the bolts. Got your plan saw in there. Set to go. Washers on. And then your wing nuts. And there you have it. A simple and affordable plant press that will last you for years to come. And if you'd rather purchase one, make one.
