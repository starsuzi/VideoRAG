 Hi, I'm Curt and this is Chris, we're with celebrity custom homes. We're going to show you some steps to take if your garbage disposal quits working or is clogged. First, you want to locate the garbage disposal underneath the sink. Next you'll want to reach underneath and there's a red reset button underneath the garbage disposal. Make sure that it's reset and then try the switch again up top. Gurbages disposal will be working. If a garbage disposal is clogged, make sure that you pull power from the power cord underneath the sink. Locate the wrench that you have that you can fit up and underneath the inside of the garbage disposal from the bottom. Turn it until it becomes unclogged. Push water down the sink to run anything that was clogged back out of the disposal. Plug in the disposal and turn on the power switch. The clog should be removed. Remember to never stick your hand down inside the garbage disposal.
