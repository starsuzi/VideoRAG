 Hi, I'm Ed. Today we're going to make fiddlehead ferns sauteed with garlic. Fiddlehead ferns are basically baby ferns picked, usually in the northeast and in the spring. They take a little attention. They're a little bit tough, so we're going to do in two stages. We're going to steam them and then we're going to saute them with a couple of cloves of garlic, some salt, pepper and olive oil. But we do want to trim off any little brown tips on them. So we're going to do that first and then into the steamer. All right, we've thoroughly washed and trimmed our fiddlehead ferns. Now we're going to put them in a steamer and cook them through to soften up probably around between five and ten minutes. We're going to check them after five and see how they're doing. Make sure they're nice and soft. We've finished steaming our fiddlehead ferns for about eight minutes. They're completely cooked and it's nice and soft. Now we're going to give them some flavor by sauteing them in some extra virgin olive oil, a little salt, pepper and two garlic cloves that I've chopped. We're all ready to go in right now. So preheated a pan a little bit. All my little ferns in there. Getting the tablespoons in the soles of the olive oil. This is just enough for two people. It's about a third of a pound. This is just the number of people you're cooking for. Little salt, turn it heat down. We're just going to cook these for a couple minutes. So we've been sauteing these for about two minutes or so and they are pretty much ready. Just a little bit of brown. We don't want to burn or brown the garlic. So we're going to turn them off the heat and serve them up. We're going to serve up our little fiddlehead ferns with some grilled loin lamb chops and our roasted fingerling potatoes. Let's try one here. Delicious. Just a little bit of garlic. Nice and soft. Not tade, fiddlehead ferns with garlic and olive oil. Enjoy.
