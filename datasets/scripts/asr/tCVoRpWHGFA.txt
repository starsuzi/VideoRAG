 This is all October 28th, so this is an extra credit lab. My experiment is to put an egg into the bottle and then put a wininger into it. I just want to find out the rule of I asked AC base neutralization. I think there will be some reaction in the bottle of this bottle. The main thing of the AC show is the calcium carbonate. I think they will have a reaction with the wininger. Last week I was in the beginning of my experiment. This is a wininger. I think it's from the market. Pantry is never a man. It's not a matter. I will put the wininger into the bottle. You can see there are a lot of air bubbles come from the AC show. Maybe there was one of the reason is there is a lot of hole in the AC show. So the air into the AC will come out of the AC show. So the second reason is that you will know this reaction. Maybe what will happen in the future. This is the second day of my experiment. So we can see there are a lot of air bubbles around the AC show. I think right now it's not the air. It's the carbon dioxide. And then you can notice that there are some brown things that surface of the wininger. I think it's maybe the calcium is an acidate. Yeah, it's pretty cool right? This is the last day of my experiment. I spent half an hour. And we can notice that the AC drop down to the bottom of the bottle. There are no more carbon dioxide came out from the system. And this means the reaction is over. And we can notice that most of the AC show is disappointed. We can see the reactions here. And this is the calcium acidate. And I think the top of the wininger, the brown substance is the calcium acidate. And there was no more carbon dioxide came out. We can see the detail of the AC show. Most of them is disappeared and we can see the AC. This is pretty good. It's interesting.
