 What's up guys, it's Ray. Welcome back to my channel and today's video. I'm going to show you guys alternatives to blending stump slash tortillins and basically these are just tools that help you smudge and blend During your drawing process, but no, I understand that like sometimes it's hard to come around You may not know where to get them or they just might be expensive So today we're gonna do some DIY and also some stuff that you have lined around the house that work Just as awesome as blending tools Alright, so starting off. I'm using a number two hb pencil on 50 pound paper and it's really smooth So I won't have like a lot of distortion of the blending and I'm just doing like a basic swatch right here of Graphite and I'm gonna blend every single swatch that I do out So the first one I'm going to use is the infamous Cortillin and I'm using this first that way you guys can compare the Products that I show you compared to an actual blending tool and of course it performs great It's very precise, but I understand not everybody may be able to have access. So let's move on to number two Alright, so the first thing that I'm going to show you guys is actually a paint brush and a lot of professional artists Used paint brushes to blend out their work because it gives such a soft blend to the work And the good thing about this is that you can use it over and over and over again And you don't have to worry about going out and buying new tortillians or blending stumps You can just wash this one off and start all over again So onto number two and this is by far my favorite and that is an eyeshadow sponge This is the first time I actually used one for blending and I was just Alone away with how beautiful blended out like I couldn't believe how evenly it distributed the product and how it softened everything So if you're looking for like really soft shadows Specifically like if you're doing human figure or something this This is it guys. This is it and Honestly, it might be too good to be true. Roll that slow mo Oh So nice Alright, so for this next one you would probably have it in your bathroom as we speak and if you don't have it You probably have easy access to go get it from pretty much any store in your region and that is Q-tips. Yes, those wonderful cotton swabs And I don't have to explain you already know what's going on so I'm just gonna fast forward it and You guys can see just how well it works Not bad, huh guys? I like to use Q-tips whenever I'm doing watercolor because they absorbed so well So that's another tip you should try So next up in the ballgame we got a paper towel and I know I know all you guys have this at your house at least Every single person has one roll But basically all I'm going to be doing is just folding it in half and folding that in half and just basically folding it until it's like a really sturdy little square and Honestly before I knew what blending tools were I would do this all the time and They never let me down seventh grade ray was really into paper towels and As you can see here. It's a pretty good transition All right next up is the exact same method but with 50 pound sketch paper and I'm just going to be doing the exact same thing folding it up and using the very corner tip of it to blend out and If you don't have any tools whatsoever, but you just have pencil and paper. Yeah, this is what's up All right, this next method of blending if I put it in my video I get a lot of crap for it and that is blending with your finger Sometimes you just don't have access to blending equipment and or you just like blending with your fingers You know, that's fine. I do it all the time and yeah, I love it So for this last method of blending I just want to apologize in advance for the reflection of the light I will insert pictures and video of what it looks like Without the reflection, but that is using a pencil to blend out, you know A lot of the pencil sets they come with different pencils of different shades and darknesses and lightnesses And that's basically so you can learn how to shade with just pencils and without smudging and it gives a really precise crisp look to your drawings As promised here's the video of me kind of like covering of the light with my hand So the reflection doesn't show through and you can see it just takes a little bit more effort to learn how to blend with pencils But you can do it. I believe in you Alright, that's all the video I have for you today If you have any questions leave them down below and I will try my best to answer them Thank you guys so much for watching my video.
