 Welcome to the Nesspresso Assistance video on cleaning your Latissima Pro machine. In order to obtain a perfect cup of coffee, time after time, we suggest you follow some simple instructions. To start, the quality of water is essential for enhancing the aroma of your espresso, so we suggest you refill the water tank on a daily basis using fresh water. After every use, it is important to remove the Uesnisspresso capsule and not let it remain in the extraction system. We recommend that you regularly empty the capsule container and drip tray in order to avoid overflowing. You can easily separate them for cleaning. After using your machine for the last time, simply let a cup of water without a capsule flow through in order to wash away any residue left in the flow system. We recommend to clean the coffee outlet regularly with a soft damp cloth. Carefully rinse away any dirt residue on the hot water nozzle with drinking water and clean it with a clean damp cloth. Use a damp cloth and mild cleaning agent to clean the surface of the machine. Careful, do not use any strong agent or solvent cleaner. Do not put any machine components in the dishwasher except the rapid cappuccino components. You can empty the system before a period of non-use or for transportation. To start, enter the menu by pressing the gear's button, browse the options and select empty water system. Press the validation button to confirm a short text appears on the display, indicating the approximate time needed for the entire process. Confirm this message by pressing the validation button. Now if you're ready, you can continue. Press the validation button. Remove the water tank. Use a cup under the coffee outlet. And press again the validation button to start the cycle. Once the cycle is finished, the machine switches off. Tempety and clean the used capsule container and drip tray.
