 Welcome to my channel to desvieron what's made the OSTEL Pot the Puerto Rican style my way if you want to see this video stay tuned ok in here I have three pounds of the oyster OSTELs if what I'm going to do is I'm going to watch them with lemon you can watch them with lemon of vinegar be it good, a couple of times, change the water and I'm going to cook this in my pressure cooker but if you don't have a pressure cooker you can cook it in a regular pot so you see I already watched the OSTELs and I'm going to season it you can put any seasoning you like and I'm going to preheat the my pressure cooker I'm going to use salt but you can use any seasoning of your preference and if you don't want to touch the meat you can definitely use this possible glove and I'm going to put some black pepper here this green stuff is so free top but first I'm going to put a one envelope also salt, sazon is color and if you don't want to use sazon you can use paprika like two tablespoons or two your taste and this green stuff in here is so free top so free top is green peppers, onion, fresh call, cilantro, everything put in the blender and I had a video and I had a made so free top you want to pass to my channel or I'm going to leave it on the on top of this video any place around there or at the end of the video going to be the link for the so free top you want to mix it up and so free top give it a nice flavor and like I said I'm going to cook this in a pressure cooker but if you don't have one you can cook it and just have a look like a pat but have in mind that this is going to take a long time to cook if you want them soft for three to four hours so I'm just going to saute it and don't throw the juice because we're going to add it later and don't let it saute for about a minute and my mother can't go to see it and I'm going to put it in my room high and I recommend you if you want to do it in a regular pad you're going to put a lot of water and keep in all your water after the water is boiling you're going to put in a medium and you're going to keep in all your water if you think you need to add more water you're going to do it okay and now I'm going to add one can of tomato sauce that's eight ounces and now I'm going to pour the juice we had left in the container and in here I'm adding four cups of water but honestly I actually add more and probably have weight a little bit more I'm going to say probably six to seven cups of water and then I'm going to let it cook this for approximately I say in Spanish and my video in Spanish I say 30 minutes or less to cook 40 minutes but honestly you can let it cook for 45 to 1 hour and I'm going to put the lid on you're going to start counting the time when the when the dinner on top start by really like start releasing the vapor that's what you want to count the hour okay so after 40 minutes in here you're going to check if you know how to handle the pressure cooker you know you got to be careful release all the vapor out I'm going to add some potatoes but that optional you don't have to do if you don't want to already cut two potatoes and add them in there but you know you didn't put it out whatever you want and now I'm going to put the lid back on on top add a little bit more water but I should and I can say I should add more and then I'm going to put the lid on and I'm going to let it cook for 10 more minutes that's what I say if you let it cook for one hour you don't have to have no problem you check it if you think it's tender and then you live the way it is is you need to cook it more just put the the lid back on and finish cooking and I'm going to show you the final result and here's the final result I'm going to show you now with rice and beans together some fried plantains and both videos are in my channel and in English version so this is Puerto Rican Oxtail my way so I hope you guys like it thank you for watching okay this is the final result of the Puerto Rican Oxtails you want to try how do you like it I recommend you use an pressure cooker to put more water because the pressure cook is a little bit day yet and leave it for an hour and let's be too little bit if you like this video, you can give me a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more videos other than that, it's all bye bye you too little baby you too you're going to be super happy and then it's my smile you
