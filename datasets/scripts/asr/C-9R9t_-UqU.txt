 Hi guys, I'm back again after a brief hiatus to show you how to make caramelised onions. Rich, sweet caramelised onions are so versatile, in tart, pizza, bread or sauces and they're really super easy to make. It does take a bit of time and the shopping might cause a few tears but it's totally worth it. When you're done, store them in a clean jar in the refrigerator and it'll keep them absolutely ages. To make this dish, you're going to need the following ingredients. Around 40 grams of butter, around 4 tablespoons of olive oil and a whole load of onions, usually about 15 to 20 is a good amount. And here are the ingredients, on screen once again few minutes. Start off by peeling and chopping the onions, you may find that using a mandolin is the easiest way to do this. In a large pot, heat the butter and olive oil together, on a high heat and when hot, add in the onions and stir well to coat the onion in the hot fat. For the onions, add this temperature for about 5 minutes, stirring regularly until they start to turn translucent. Turn the heat right down, very low, a bit above the minimum setting and leave the pot on the stove. Stir the onions every 20 to 30 minutes or so, they will reduce in volume a lot and gradually start to turn more and more brown. After a good couple of hours, you'll need to stir the pan more regularly as they will now start to caramelise quite quickly, although it can still be up to another hour or so from here. Finally, the sugars will start to burn on the bottom of the pan and the onions will be a deep golden brown with a rich, sweet flavour.
