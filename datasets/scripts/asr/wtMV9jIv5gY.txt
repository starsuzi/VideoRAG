Like, say that we got one. But they didn't want us even to hold it. They said that we had to pay money for it. And we only recorded about like two minutes of talking to them. But it was way longer. And then, after we got the flash pass, we were able to hold it from the chick IKEA. We showed the picture. I was holding it. And then, one back there. And that's Carlos. If he was part of us, he said, yeah. So, it was still really fun day. Oh, yeah. It was really fun day. So, thanks for watching this video.
