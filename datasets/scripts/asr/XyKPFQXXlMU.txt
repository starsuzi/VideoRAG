 This video here is to show you how to make your split system air conditioner sparkly white again or any plastic lying around the house that is faded yellow. I've not enhanced the after image of the split system air conditioner. This is how good the results are if done properly. So the best way of doing this is actually buying a UV light. Link in the description. Or you can use a mirror and sunlight and reflect the sunlight onto your split system air conditioner. I am doing mine outside. Hair peroxide is what you need. Something strong like 12% try not to get 3. You need something to seal the moisture in. I'm using clear bags. Some duct tape to seal it as well. But you can use cling wrap. Make sure the appliance or the item is disconnected from power. Brush on the peroxide on the item. Making sure you're staying away from any electrical. After that, seal with your cling wrap or clear bags. Leave out in the sun for a couple of days or with a UV light for a couple of hours. Make sure all the areas are exposed with the sun or UV light. This video is after a day and you can see the sun's only been hitting the one side and there's a big difference. So the sun is a big factor in activating this process in making the unit or piece wider. Unwrap and wipe down. Or in my case, use a gardening hose. If you like my video, please like and subscribe.
