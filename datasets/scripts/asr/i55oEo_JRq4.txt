 Hello and welcome to the art of cooking. I'm going to show you how to make brown sauce, braised sauce, mother sauce or whatever you want to call it. I made some changes to this recipe for those of you who have seen my Joseph's video. Same ingredients, but different amount. This will yield about 2.2 cups or 517 milliliters. So let's get started. In a bowl, I didn't want to 2 teaspoons of minced ginger. 1 to 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. 1 green onion root, about 2 teaspoons worth. 2.5 tablespoons or 37 grams of sugar. 3 tablespoons of 45 milliliters of soy sauce. 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of cooking wine. 1 tablespoon or 15 milliliters of mushroom flavored dark soy sauce. 1 tablespoon or 15 milliliters of hoysand sauce. 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of oyster sauce. 1 teaspoon or 5 milliliters of sesame oil. 1.5 cups 355 milliliters of heated chicken or vegetable stock. Let the sauce cool down. At this point, we are essentially extracting the flavor from the ginger, garlic and green onions. Once it's cool, use a sieve and drain. Discard the roots. So there you have it. I'm going to use the sauce very frequently. So if you want to, you can double the amount. For storage, you can store in the fridge up to about a week or you can store in the freezer for future consumption. And thank you for watching this video.
