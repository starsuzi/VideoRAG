 I'm going to be personally using them for my Choo Choo that I'm making. I'm going to be using these. After you cut all of your ends to the desired length, you're then going to take your wood burning tool. I have tried a lighter and after a while it starts to hurt. You're going to lay the ribbon on the wood burning tool very lightly just on the ends. You would just take it and run it across. If you pull like this, no string should come off and you should feel a seal on the end. It feels like a piece of plastic. Again, here is where I cut. You can see that it's fried right there. You're just going to take it and run it across like so. Just feel it and it's sealed. I don't know if you can see that. That's pretty much it. I found that that's the easiest way. You don't want to take it and lay it right on. Let me show you why. If you take it and lay it right on, you'll see where it lifts up. I don't know if you can see that or not, but it lifts up the material. I just like to. I found that if you just run it across like that, it works out a lot better. Again, run it and it seals it immediately. That's pretty much it. If you have any questions, leave a comment below. Be sure to visit me on DIY, Lori, Michelle on Facebook and also on Etsy.
