 Hi, my name's Fred and this is my bar and these are my top five mule cocktails If you liked this video give us a thumbs up and subscribe on the link below and at the end of this video Please look for all over other bar and restaurant related videos. Thanks for watching Okay, the first drink we are making this evening is the classic Moscow mule now There's a couple things you should know this one Copramule mug I'm using here is only 15 ounces. I'm gonna be using some others later on that are 20 23 ounce mug so please make sure you know the size of your mug Before you start pouring your drink that way you can make adjustments as needed So the reason we use a copper mug is the copper is a great conductor of the cold So it really takes on the the icy temperature of the drink once you start pouring it in you don't have to use the Copper mug in a mule, but it is recommended so for this worst first one we have the cold day Moscow mule We're gonna use one and a half ounces of vodka. I'm using Tito's vodka And then to that we are going to squeeze a half of lime which is about a half ounce of lime juice right into the drink We're gonna top with ice And we are going to top with ginger beer I'm using the Gosling ginger beer And we are garnish with a lime wheel or a wedge right in the drink and There you have your Moscow mule delicious Okay, the next mule we are making today is called the Kentucky mule the Kentucky mule It's pretty much the exact same recipe as the Moscow mule except we are substituting a bourbon I am using Jim bean so let's get started you're gonna need one and a half ounces of the Jim bean bourbon Then you're going to squeeze half a lime All right, we're gonna add ice And then we are going to fill with the ginger beer And we're gonna put a lovely garnish of a mint sprick and There you have your Kentucky mule delicious Okay, the next mule we are making this evening again one of my favorite is the apple spice mule Again, this is the larger mule mug so I have made my adjustments for this one. We're going to need two ounces of the Jim bean apple And in addition to the two ounces of the Jim bean apple I also put a half ounce of the st. Germain's elder flour le corps I like it. It gives it a little herbal flavor which brings out that the spice We are going to add now with these we're gonna start switching over from the lime juice to a lemon lime sour We're gonna use a half ounce of that We're going to top with ice And fill with ginger beer And for this mule you are going to tumble to incorporate And there you have the apple spice mule delicious Okay, the next drink we are making this evening is called a blackberry mule a blackberry mule What you're going to need is two ounces of the jacked anules We're going to use another half ounce of the st. Germain's The elder flour le corps We are going to add one ounce of blueberries and a blueberry puree Here we go And then we are going to add a half ounce of the lemon lime sour Top with ice Tumble oh, I said tumble we got to add the ginger beer first There we go now we tumble The tumble do incorporate all the fruit as well as mix the little flickers And with this one we are also going to garnish with a mint sprig And a lime wedge And there you have it Okay before I go on with this next drink I just wanted to mention a couple things some more variations That I should have mentioned while making the drinks on the apple spice mule Another great variation instead of the jimbeam apple is using the jacked anules honey And it's a honey mule it's delicious and then with the blackberry mule that we just made If you substitute strawberries or strawberry puree as well as vodka you can use the tito's vodka That would be a strawberry mule and it is absolutely delicious So lots of variations in all these drinks have fun trying all the different versions But for this one this one is called an LDablo because I'm the big fan of the shambour For this drink you're going to need a good tequila which means 100% blue agave tequila We're going to use two ounces of this All right and with that we are going to add a half ounce of shambour There we go Now if you didn't add the shambour and you just did the tequila with the lime squeeze And the ginger beer would be called a Mexican mule but since we added the tequila and the Shambour this is becoming an LDablo we're going to add the ice And with this one I'm also going to add a half ounce of the lemon sour And we are going to top with ginger beer We need to get one more And we are going to garnish with a lime And there you have your LDablo delicious Hey thanks for watching we appreciate it again if you like this video give us a thumbs up And subscribe on the link below and at the end of this video which is right now Please look for all of our other bar and restaurant related videos Thanks for watching
