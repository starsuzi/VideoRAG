 So if you're looking for a way to store your guacamole, you don't want to turn all around, use some plastic wrap. It's really easy to do. What you're going to want to do is make sure you cover up the guacamole 100% at least on the surface. Just grab a small sheet of saran wrap about the size of the bowl that you're using and then you're storing it in. And it's just kind of a technique to get it tight on the lid. Clear it out. Make sure you have some lemon juice in there. So that will keep it from browning all by itself there. Take the plastic wrap and instead of just putting it over the surface like that, you're going to want to actually press it down over the lid and get the air pockets out of there. Now I'm not going to be able to reuse the plastic afterwards but it's really going to keep the browning to a minimum while it sits and the flavor is melt in your fridge.
