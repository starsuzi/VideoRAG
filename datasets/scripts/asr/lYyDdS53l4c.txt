 Hey there, Scott from Spring Hill Nurseries with one of our specialties today. Iris, this is one of my favorite plants. When you're selecting the site for your iris, make sure it's a spot that gets about six hours of sunlight a day. These plants love the sun. When you plant a few at a time, make sure you keep them about a foot apart so they can really grow up nice and tall. When you dig your hole, you don't actually want to make it too deep. If you look at what I've done here, come take a look. I've made a little mound in the center of my hole. I'm going to take my iris rhizome and place it on top. I'm going to spread the roots out over top of that mound there. That way the plant drains and it doesn't rot out. You want about a third of your rhizome sticking up above the soil. You fill it in. Make sure you get that good garden slittle there. Then you're going to water it. Give it a good watering and it's going to drain where I've built that mound. You just fill it in a little bit more on top of that. You've got a nice well planted iris. It's going to look good and easy and it'll be beautiful. That's it for iris planting. I'm Scott from Spring Hill Nurseries.
