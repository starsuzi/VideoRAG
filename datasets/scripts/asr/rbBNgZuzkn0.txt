 Now we're serving turnips with a chicken, and what really pisses me off is that people are so rude about turnips, they're full of flavour, they're a great wind of vegetable, and we're going to be caramelising these with some Chinese spice spice. As the turnips soften, I drain off the fat and add a good dowsing of port. This glays the turnips, and as it reduces, they turn a great colour. Let's go, John. More port, little bit butter. Yeah, more than we want you doing that. Like the turnips, I'm also serving mashed potato. Now some people use very fluffy and flurry potatoes, but I'm using a knife and waxy potato to help take on more cream and butter. The secret behind making a great mash, for me personally, it's keeping the skins on. The skins protect the potato, so therefore it doesn't absorb all that water, and we peel them when they're piping hot. Never be tempted to make a mashed potato in a food processor. That turns into like a gluey, horrible mess. I use hot milk and a riser to make the mash. A lot of people take the potatoes off the stove at this stage, but I use a low heat to cook off any excess water and melt in the butter. There we go. Four here, Mark. Six first, and don't burn that butter, sheema. Watch that butter doesn't burn there, yes? Mark four, and then six, yes.
