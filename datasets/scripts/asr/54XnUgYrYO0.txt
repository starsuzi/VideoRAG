 This is how to get mustard out of carpet. For this you will need a few things. You will need a spying solution of one-quart water and one tablespoon of mild dish soap such as joy. You will need a chemical called stain magic. There is a link in the information panel about where you can find that. It's readily available on Amazon. You mix it one part solution A, one part B, and another spray bottle. You will need a steam iron, set on a low steam setting, spying towel, an additional towel soaked in water. To begin, take your regular spying solution, misted on the spot, and dab the spot. Make sure you dab if you don't want to rub it in, because that will spread the stain. Keep going until no more of the spot transfers. Then draw the spot well. Next, you will spray your stain magic on the spot. Almost immediately starts reacting. Then you apply your damp towel to the top of it. And your steam iron. Keep the iron moving. Don't let it sit one spot too long and don't let it contact the carpet directly because that could burn the carpet. As you see, it's almost out. We're going to hit it again with the stain magic solution. Be sure not to be directly above this when you hit it with iron, because it will fume up. And there's a little ammonia in there. That will become irritating. So use it in a well-manled spot. We're almost completely out. We're about 95%. We'll give it one more go. The solution will keep on working after you finish for a few hours. So even if it's not completely out, chances are after a few hours it will be gone. You can just barely see that. So not go ahead and take your middle spotter again. Just clean up any residue. You can barely see the mustard still very slightly, but that should disappear from the next few hours.
