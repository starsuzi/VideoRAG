 How often do I water my indoor plants? You know there's really no easy answer. There's three different variables that you have to take in account. That is the type of plant, the size of the pot, and how much light it's receiving. So the type of plants, say for instance it's a zzz poem. This is a zzz right here. Drought tolerant doesn't need to be watered that often. In comparison though, this guy right behind me here is a pieceily. It's a plant that needs a little extra water, likes to be on the moist side. So plant variety, number one. Number two, the size of the container. We have two different pathos right here. You can see two different pot sizes because this one here isn't just an 80-bitty-bitty pot. It's going to be needed to be watered more often than this guy over here. Next, the amount of light. Plants that are in higher light situations need to be watered more often. Those in a little bit less light or let's say it's a cloudy week, less water. So I'm probably confusing you right now. The best way to determine what your plants need water is this right here. Stick your finger into the soil. If it feels moist, it doesn't need to be watered. If it feels dry, make sure you go ahead and water your plants.
