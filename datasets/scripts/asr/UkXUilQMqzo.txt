 Okay, I'm making some clotted cream but I'm making it speedy because I need some clotted cream for my blueberry scones. So I'm just basically evaporating the cream and what I do is when it starts to clot, I just push it over to the one side and then I put it in my container here and I keep that in the freezer and by the time the scones are done here's a good one. My cream is pretty well clotted and what I try to do is move all the clots to the one side and then you know I can just scoop them up with the spoon. There's one right there. See that one and I just you know skim them off the top and then I keep them in the freezer and by the time that my scones are done so as my you know a small amount this is only a half point let me see. So see this side has some and by the time my scones are done so will my pint of well it's a half-pint cream. I'm just and it doesn't take long to do it this way and by the time well you'll see in a few minutes and every few minutes I just remove the clots there's one. Okay I'll be back.
