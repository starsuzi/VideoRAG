 Hi, I'm Christina Jackson, Natural Food Chef and Holistic Health Coach. Today we're here at the Venezuarmus Market and we're going to select some fresh rosemary. This is what fresh rosemary looks like. One thing you want to look at is the overall color of it and the overall appearance of it. This one we have today has little flowering buds on it, which is okay. That's okay to get that. It just means that it's getting close to the end of its cycle. Go ahead and pick that one up. Also, another way to determine fresh rosemary is go ahead and smell it. It should have amazing aroma as this one does. And then, you know, overall feel of it. If you're going to be buying fresh rosemary, you don't want it necessarily too hard, but a little soft. And, you know, go ahead and chop that up. It doesn't mean you can't dry it out yourself and he's it as at a later date and throw that into your recipes. But fresh rosemary is amazing. You can add that to roast potatoes. You can put that in a sauce. And, you know, you can just enjoy the aroma by bringing that around your house. So, next time you're at your market, you see some fresh rosemary. Go ahead and pick that up and put it in your next recipe. Happy shopping. Thanks for watching. Be sure to catch our other videos here at mahalo.com.
