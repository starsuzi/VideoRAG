 So today we're going to make an incredibly cheap yet very effective homemade fabric softener. So into a bowl I've placed in three cups of water and then to that I'm going to add in one and a half cups of white vinegar. Next you can use any flavoured essence you want, I'm going to use some lavender for this one. Just to give those clothes a nice smell afterwards so I'm going to add about a tablespoon of that. Now if you want to go completely chemical free, stop right there because that alone will make it out standing fabric softener. Now just to go that little bit further we're going to use some hair conditioner. Now just get the cheapest one you can possibly get. This is like the cheapest of the cheap, it was like a dollar fifty I think it was and it does make a difference in the clothes. So please don't get an expensive brand, just get the cheap one. It works just the same. So to that we're going to add in one cup of that. Now all that's left is getting the whisk and we're just going to give it a very, very good mix through just so it's all well combined. Now what we have to do is just store it into a jar or you can use an old fabric softener container if you like. And there we have it, our very own homemade fabric softener and that was incredibly easy to make and also incredibly cheap. And you can use it just like any other fabric softener, just put the same amount into the fabric softener section of your wash machine. So make it at home as cost you a tenth of the price easily.
