 Hi, my name is Jackie and welcome to Jackie Howe. Today I am making a video on how I clean my makeup. So this is what I use. I use this alcohol. I see propyl alcohol and I just get it from Target. And I fill it up in one of these spray bottles that I get from Target, Amazon, Rite Aid. And I actually spray my makeup with this. I spray my makeup to clean my makeup regularly. So you don't have any bacteria or oils or if you're sharing makeup or doing makeup on someone. You don't get any infections or anything like that. So I spray my makeup. This is how I do it. This is my lipstick. And you just give it a few sprays and let it air dry. Once it's air dry, you just put it away and it's clean. For example, my bronzer, give me sun, give it a few sprays, let it air dry. My contour kit. And that's it. And my highlighters. You get the idea. I hope you enjoyed. Quick and easy. Sanitize and you have clean makeup. Subscribe to my channel and I hope you enjoy. Please give it a thumbs up. And I'll see you soon. Thank you. Bye!
