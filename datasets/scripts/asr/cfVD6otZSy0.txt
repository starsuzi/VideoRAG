 Okay, I want to make a review of the spider and insect traps. I I seen this advertised on the internet and I've got these camel crickets in the basement. So I purchased these and and you get four of them for only three dollars and 88 cents for Walmart. It's a very good price and they do work very great. So later in this video I'm going to show you how effective they were and how they worked. So okay, bye. Okay, I took two strips and I put them down in the basement, one behind the toilet and the camel crickets are cannibals. So when you catch one there will be another one come to see if they can eat the other one. So this is what's happened in less than a week. Okay, this is another strip in a different location in the basement. There's not as much activity over here but I caught three at the same time frame as the other one.
