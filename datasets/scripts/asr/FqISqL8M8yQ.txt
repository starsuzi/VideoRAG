 Hey, Coyote. Yeah. Come here. Tell me what this fruit smells like. Sweet. What are those? It's Smell-Dove. Jennifer, what is this? Smell-Dove. Smell-Dove. Oh, my gosh. What is that? You can eat it. It's Noni and it's very healthy. It's good for you. People eat that? No. It's good for you. That is not good for you. I think Coyote needs to eat a Noni fruit. No. Anything you want? Yeah. Mario, do you think so? As Angus has taught me. Sure. Coyote. No. I'm not here. I'm not here yet. I challenge you to eat one. Oh. Go. Come on, swallow, swallow. You're gonna eat it. Oh, my God. Swallow, swallow, swallow. Swallow. You're gonna eat that, you're gonna eat it. Oh, my God. It's fucking heavy. I don't want to eat this fruit. I don't want to eat this fruit. Like, you guys have no idea how bad it smells. And the minute I smelled it, I gagged. And then Jennifer said, you can eat it. I'm like, you may be a good, but I don't want to. And then she kind of went off on this tangent about how it's healthy and that, you know, she's gonna eat it and if she's gonna eat it, I've gotta eat it. Now here we are, a few minutes away from me eating a puke fruit or whatever it's called. I'm thinking, you are sitting here. This is ridiculous. This is the most absurd thing I've ever done on location. So right now we are at kids saving the rainforest here in Costa Rica, talking about conservation and education, and we're out there in the field and Mark says, hey, come smell this fruit. Now oftentimes I think, oh, it's a fruit. It may not be the prettiest fruit, but it's probably smells pretty good. So I'm gonna have to say, it's a fruit, it may not be the prettiest fruit, but it's probably smells pretty good. It's fruit, right? People eat fruit. Yellow out to you, oh Jennifer, can you eat these things? I take a whiff of it and it is rancid. And what is it called? Noni. Noni. So Jennifer, tell us about this fruit. What's the most amazing? What's the most amazing? Well, the most amazing. We want to eat this, is it's very healthy for you. Nobody wants to eat this. Look in any health food store and you will see Noni drink and we're getting the natural heat just picked off the tree. And it's very good for everything. Diabetes, heart, you name it. So we're gonna get you nice and healthy today. Yeah, it's good for you, man. Is there anything healthy about throwing up? Because that honesty, guys, that is what's gonna happen. I have a squeamish stomach. I can take bullet-ant-sting, snap-in-turtle bites, not a problem, but when it comes to like nauseous things, I gag when I smell it here. I'm gonna pick up a piece and show it to the camera. Oh, it's squishy. Oh, it's like falling apart my fingers. Kind of like a giant grub. Look at that. Why does it look like a grub when it's a fruit? Like nothing about this says, eat me, I'm healthy. Who is the first person that would have ever thought to put something distinctly in their mouths? Just... You wanna smell that? Oh, what's the smell like? Can you describe the smell? It's like milk has been sitting in the sun for several days. You poured that milk into a rubber boot. You stepped in dog boot, put your foot into the boot with the rancid milk, and then you walked around in the jungle for an hour, you poured that out into some sort of a balloon. And then you said, eat it. Imagine that. And this is healthy. That sounds completely made up. You're just squishing it up with your fingers. What does the matter with you? That is so my gosh, I'm getting off to it. Oh, you've eaten this before? I'm just checking for words. What? Ah! Alright, so how do we do this? Do I just bite into this like it's a puke potato or whatever? Like I'm gonna throw up. Your name did what do you call it puke fruit? It's a puke fruit. You call it a no-ne? I call it a puke fruit. Or a puke potato. You choose. Either way you guys are about to see my lunch come back up and do a bucket. So where's the bucket at? It's right here. So you're not kidding. You think you're really going to do this? If I can even manage to get it in my mouth and chew it for a couple of seconds, I will be very proud of myself. Just... Ha! This is easier to get sung by a bullet ant. I'm not even kidding. Alright. Alright, just for good measure. Because I know you guys all want to hear it. I'm Coyote Peterson. And I'm about to enter the puke zone with the puke fruit. I can't believe this. Alright, heart's racing. One... Two... Three... You got a swallow. You got a swallow. Nope. Fight it. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! I got you, bud. No, you got to give me a job. Ha! Ha! You have to swallow this one, bud. Oh, I can't do it! Yes, oh, you don't need it. You're doing good. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Okay, nope. You got this. You got this. One... We got a swallow. At least a little bite. A mini bite. Ha! That's not a mini bite. Come on. Come on, swallow. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow. You should have for house yours. Just as bad as his, I hate to say. I thought I had win. And I don't think I'm winning. No, you're winning. You're actually eating yours. Oh, God. Okay, let's... It's swallowing it. But... Oh, my God. Wow. Wow. Wow. That's the real stuff. Oh, God, that's the real stuff. Oh, God, that's the real stuff. You're right. Do you feel healthy? I told you this was gonna happen. Do you feel healthy? I think all the pride foods have come out. Well, guys, I think it's safe to say. I have failed the puke fruit challenge. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Did you even eat any of them? Oh, yeah. She's been halfway through her. Wanna see a real man? Oh, my goodness. Let's see her. Oh, oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm gonna try some. Are you really? Give me some. Be careful. I mean, he's serious. There's no worms in this room. No, no, no, there's none. Here. Somebody hold the camera. Oh, my God. And there's a beautiful, beautiful, you mark. Oh, God. It's really bad. Oh, it's all, it's all. It's all. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. It's really bad. It's really bad. I'll do it. Oh. Oh. Oh, my goodness. It's like bad cheese. Oh. Yeah, of course. All right, Cody. That was awful. I will agree. Bad. I think it's safe to say that the puke fruit. Oh. Definitely lives up to its name. Jennifer, you won that one. I'm Carrie Peterson. Be brave. Stay wild. We'll see on the next location. Oh, that was so cool. I'm going to try to get the food. We'll see on the next location. Oh, that was so gross. Just put his hand in the pool. Eating a puke fruit was pretty disgusting. But was it as bad as drinking prickly pear juice from a sweaty sock? If you missed that one, make sure to go back and watch our zombie juice episode.
