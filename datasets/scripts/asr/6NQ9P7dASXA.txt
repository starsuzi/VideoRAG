 Okay, we're back, we're all sat, we have the rest of the load is inside and now Paige is going to take the items. Oh, by the way, this is a wash off that I found as we were putting the load in that looks like somebody did their nails and used a washcloth that normally wouldn't be used for your nails. So we're gonna see how our little combination here does on that also. So, Paige didn't want to take them off of there. So I wanted to show you as a put them in I have one of each and Paige has the items in there and there's those both of those and the bleach is see if I could pour this and film it at the same time. Thanks, Paige. Fill that up to our max line. Those of you with the same washer and then also we found that the fabric softener if you fill it to the max fell over here is way too much. It's way too much fabric softener and I don't know if any of you know what that feels like but it's it's just weird. It's too soft. Yeah. I was kind of itching. Right. So it was it was kind of anti-soft. Yeah, we're gonna close the washer. Close the washer. Yep. Turn the power on. White. Turn the dial to white. Oh, wait. Put it onto heavy then high on hot. We're gonna do the extra rinse. You just shut the extra rinse off. Oops. And now we're gonna turn the fabric softener to center on. Now we're gonna start and we'll check back with you in 79 minutes. Bye.
