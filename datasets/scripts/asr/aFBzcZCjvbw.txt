 Hi, welcome back and this is still Sunday July 22nd and we're going to go in the kitchen in private. The suburb area is in a minute, but first I want to say thank you because I have exceeded my goal of 777 subscribers and if you all remember I had asked you that if you would share my videos with your Facebook friends or with a family member just by word of mouth however you wanted to do that we're going to have a drawing for this lizard skin purse and it is genuine leather it has the leather the suede interior has a pocket inside of there and I did buy it at an anthropology it has a retail price tag of $88 anthropology and it has this shoulder strap that goes with it and this is the company I believe it's French I might be wrong it could be Italian anyway since I have reached my goal if any more of you let's see I have 30 36 nines on the list and if any of you any more of you want to share my videos and try to help me increase my sub count then and if you want the lizard skin purse just leave a lizard in your comments below this video and we're going to have the drawing I'm going to write everybody's name down individually cut out the little slips of paper put them in a pot and we're going to draw next Saturday June 28th and then you will have you know several days to contact me by email and give me your address and then I will be shipping it out to you on August 3rd so we're going to go back in the kitchen now and try out the sub-apelias so the last time I made them y'all will remember that they tasted like cornboard but I think they're going to turn out this time we'll we'll keep our fingers crossed so okay so I have my little rolloved dough right here like I said it's probably only going to make about six sub-apelias okay in my big um can I skill it I measure three cups of all and all this was just you know one more green great value vegetable all sorry about the ding and y'all I just got to notice on on you two so since I don't have rolling pin I'm going to use my glass don't know I'm a minimalist and especially after having moved into this studio apartment I just don't have room for anything and I'm OCD I don't like clutter so I gave away my rolling pin but yes and put a little bit of flour on the glass and we're going to roll this out real thin now French vignettes um they're real similar to this although you do use yeast in the dough and um they're real pretty thick but the sub-apelias can be rolled out kind of thin I'm not sure what sub-apelias stands for but for my Latino viewers if you know I've heard someone say it little pillows but I don't think that's what it means I think it means fried dough that's what it is anyway it's fried dough so you just you know roll it out of course I had a bigger cutting board I could on could roll it out thinner it's okay if if they're kind of dead now super-pelias in a Mexican restaurant um I have seen them served with strawberries on top and we do eat them with honey okay so I think that's pretty thin so I'm going to coat them into little squares and then we'll drop them in that hot grease and there's supposed to puff up y'all remember the last time I didn't that recipe that I used last time it was not my recipe because I could not find mine and I kind of had an idea where it was I thought maybe my daughter's so lit guess where it was in jules recipe box so I have it right here but these are the ingredients and um I will leave it in the description below so we're going to cut these into little you can cut them in squares or rectangles and this is my old recipe that I've had for about 40 years so it should it has always turned out good so I think that it will so let me see if this grease is hot I think it needs to heat just a minute longer okay let's drop them in and it looks like they're puffing up they better puff up let me get my spatula y'all let's not gonna flip them over oh look at that one it's perfect look y'all it's perfect okay let's go ahead and flip this one over oh my perfect little superpeel yeah oh I'm so happy y'all so like I said I will leave the simple little recipe underneath and then y'all can just fry up a little batch have another perfect one now the first one didn't puff up it could be because I cut it too big but I think it's because the grease just wasn't you know the right temperature yeah let's fry this little corner here let's see what it does and another little corner mmm these smell good y'all let me get my plate with some paper towels on it y'all I know most of the country's been having a heat wave and it's not dreadfully hot here at the Jersey Shore but um my little window unit that I have in there it is just not keeping up so um it's pretty hot in the kitchen right now but it's worth it the superpeels are worth the heat so let's go ahead and take this first one out like I said it did not turn out perfect but these these are perfect you couldn't ask for a better supper peel yeah so I'm going to go ahead and turn the fire off I have my honey now you can eat these with honey or confectioners sugar as you know the binyes or serve down at the cafe demand with confectioners sugar but since these are Mexican supper peel yours we're going to put the honey on them someone set the trap on back down in the sink here we go and you just kind of drink them in honey what you can do um oh they're hot you can bat off a corner like that and then just kind of fill it up with the honey that's what I'm going to do now I'm going to make me a cup of hot coffee and go enjoy my supper peel yours bon appetit bye guys
