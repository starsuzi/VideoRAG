 Okay, here I am in our sparrgus bed and I'm going to show you how to get your sparrgus bed ready for the winter. It's time to cut down the sparrants here and clean up the bed. We're going to add some new layer of compost and get a new layer of mulch on top. So here is the sparrgus bed ready for the next spring. Okay, so we're going to cut down the sparrgus for as you can see they're starting to yellow and die back. So it's now time to cut back the sparrgus for the winter time and we're going to clear that out. And I'm going to scrape back the top layer of mulch. We're going to rake that off the top layer and then I'm going to add a thin layer of the rock dust or as a mite, as a mite, which is supposed to help with micro nutrients. And also improve the soil. After we rake back this old mulch, we're going to save it and add it back on top at the end with a new mulch. So we now got the mulch rake back. We're going to add the as a mite to the sparrgus bed here. I probably added about 20 pounds of as a mite to this sparrgus bed. If you're unfamiliar with that, do a little research online. Supposedly it's supposed to be really good for the vegetable garden. And now we're going to add the cotton burr compost that I picked up at a local store here. I have had good luck with the cotton burr compost. Probably three to four inches of new compost on top. And now I'm going to add a new fresh layer of the cedar mulch. Lay that out, probably two to three inches and scrape back also the old mulch from before. And use that. And so now we have our sparrgus bed ready to go. Okay, so there you have it. We got our sparrgus bed all ready for the winter. We cleaned it up, cut down on the yellowing burns. Added as a mite rock dust. Added a layer of cotton burr compost. And a new fresh layer of cedar mulch. And now we are ready for the spring. We're going to start growing. And hopefully we'll have a nice large crop. Thanks for watching.
