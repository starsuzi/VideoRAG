I now have a really lovely glossing meringue and you can bake this as it is. But in order to get the really gorgeous, malowy texture of a Pavlova, I'm going to add some white wine vinegar and some corn flour. I'm choosing to flavour my Pavlova with vanilla. You can leave it plain or add some coffee or even a little cocoa powder if you want chocolate. If you want to pre-precise of your Pavlova, you can draw a pencil as the shape that you want it to be and turn the paper over. However, I prefer the more rustic approach so I'm just going to dollop it on. Use the bottom of your metal spoon to make a nice groove in the centre of the Pavlova. That's ready for the oven now so I'm going to bake this really low and slow on the bottom shelf until it's done. To check to see if your Pavlova is done, you want to make sure that it comes away from the paper easily. Yep, that's perfect so I'm just going to leave it to cool. Now my Pavlova is cool, I'm going to decorate it. I've got some nice softly whipped vanilla cream. Tunk that on in the centre there. And to go with that I've just got some mixed berries. Use whatever fruits and season and you can always flavour the cream if you like. I'm gone for the classic combination of raspberries, strawberries and a few red commons. And to finish it off I'm just going to do a nice dusting of icing sugar. Yarm, I can't wait to eat it and that is a Pavlova from BBC Good Feed.
