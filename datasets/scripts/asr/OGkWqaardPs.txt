 Hi, my name is Tara Lynn Franco. I'm going to show you today how I make some of my very special leaves that go into some of my sculptural pieces. I have several things with me here today. I've got some visc molds that I've created using clay that I've just carved into and used various tools to make marks in them and these are going to be basically my press molds I use to make my my little leaves. You can do this very quite easily just have a little bit of fun making press molds and then you just need to make a leaf shape and you're good to go. You can use actual leaf patterns from nature or you can just make them up. They always look good. So I've got some of the ones here. I want to show you this special one. This is also a small stamp I've made that can actually go you can press into clay but I've actually used it to create some leaves like this. They kind of look a little bit like feathers that's what I was going for. Anyways I'm going to start. So I've got some clay here. All you do is you take a little piece off and you roll it in your hands and because leaves tend to be tapered at the end and at both ends I make like what I call as the double-ended carrot and use that and then you take it and you press it up against your mold and then you just press with your fingers. I do it so that you can see a bit of a vein there. And then when you peel it off carefully it releases and you get this pattern and then if you want to just make it into a leaf I usually pinch the bottom and then I give it a bit of shape. And there's your leaf. I hope you enjoyed that short video.
