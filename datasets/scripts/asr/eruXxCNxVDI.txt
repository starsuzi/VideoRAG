 We're going to pump your hole in the shell that I just busted and make it a big hole. You'll take this needle. I'm thinking somewhere right in there. And you don't want to run that needle all the way in there. It's a very tough, it's a little sharp. But you just have to... Right there. That's it. It's a hole right there. It's so loose. And then watch this, we'll talk. The needle fits right in there. Okay. Cool. Right there. And then you've got a high position. Okay, so remember we clean it before we pump through it. Then we inhale our dye and then close it up. Okay? Are there any questions before we begin? Is that a day, day? Yeah. You're all going to be acting. No one's acting. I'm acting. Just like in Jackson. Don't keep these needles clean. When you're not using it, put it back in the case. Keep it sterile. If that needle gets dirty, you drop it. Don't use it. Because we don't want to puncture and get bacteria or any corn. Anything inside that is. It's a little bit of a sense. Honestly, I'm a little bit of a sterile. I think I'm not getting it out. Nothing is squeezing it out. I'm just not getting it out. Water can break or it won't be in the mind. So, there's a little bit of everything.
