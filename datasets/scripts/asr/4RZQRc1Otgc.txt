 I'm about to make some banyas right with this little banyamax and this later on you told me a banyas with the same mix for let's see let's get in these in a medium bowl, add two cups of banyama, two cups of flour and seven ounces of water then mix it together mix it together I refrigerated my dough while I waited for the oil to get in oh girl, you can pour in the oil what's off to two inches? you cheat, you did it out I used a candy thermometer because you still need the oil temperature the oil is lower it's for a lot of flour, we'll serve it else and don't forget to coat your roll okay, can you make it? I ain't gonna roll it you're all not ready because you ain't gonna fire these but continue prepare by powdered sugar to go the oil was taking a really long time because you don't got no fire on the roof I don't see no fire but continue and I was getting a little nervous I bet you were definitely didn't want to have a grease fire I got a grease fire in a fire it's very sticky and sturdy so I added a little more of my hands to make it use okay, roll it like a dough roll okay, what else need? the oil still not because there's no fire
