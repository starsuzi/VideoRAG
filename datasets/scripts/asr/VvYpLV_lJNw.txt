 What we've just been doing today is getting some punch fire abses in this nose area. We just wanted to show you with a very vascular area like this, so it's an area that bleeds a lot. Often because we can't put a stitch in this place, what we use is quartering. And so you'll see we have this over the machine here. And basically there's an electric charge and that will burn the little blood vessels so that they essentially just close up. And that stops the bleeding in these cases. So I'm going to just kind of put some gentle pressure. So it stops the little amounts of blood coming through. And then you'll see there's a little bit of smoke. And in this case that's actually already being quarterized. And you can see there's another little biopsy site here that's also being quarterized. And that's really nicely stopped any bleeding coming through. And yeah, it's a very nice way in the case where we don't want to place any stitches.
