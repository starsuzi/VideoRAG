 Hey everyone, I'm going to be showing you how to make a star bud screen tea latte. And let's get started. The first ingredients that you'll need is a pitcher of milk, a nice comb, pitcher of milk. I'm using fat free milk. It's a 20 ounce pitcher. I am filling it up a third of the way up. I'm going to be using the green matcha tea. The next thing that you'll need is a nice size spoon. This is about two big heaping tablespoons. I usually use about one nice scoop of this in the matcha tea. Once you have a nice scoop of matcha tea, you'll want to put it in your pitcher of milk. So you'll mix it in with the pitcher of milk. And you will actually stir it up just a little in there. In the green tea latte's at Starbucks, they use the classic syrup, which is a simple syrup. Basically a consistency of just sugar and water. So I prefer the vanilla and you can use any syrup to your preference. Make sure you get all the liquid from the wand before you get started. Put your pitcher under there and start frothing. Once it's reached the correct temperature, you'll let it set for about 30 seconds so that the milk can separate from the foam. And then you can also slam it down a couple times. And then you can also swirl it a little bit too to help the separation process. And it's good to have this spoon so you'll want to pour it and separate the foam from the liquid. And just pour that slowly. And you can also top it with a little bit of whipped cream. And garnish it with a little bit of matcha green tea. There is your green tea. That is looking good. There you go. Thanks for watching. I will see you later and thanks so much. If you guys have any other question comments or concerns or requests, leave them down below and I will talk to you guys later. Alrighty, bye.
