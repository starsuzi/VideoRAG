 We're going to make a pulley today. The first thing that you need is some cardboard. Any color cardboard. And you're going to cut two cardboard circles out. You'll also need a bottle cap like the one found on this sort of plastic bottle. Again any color will be fine. Just a buff cap. This is a cabab skewer. You're going to use this to make a hole in the bottle cap. Straight through the middle and through the center of each cardboard circle. Push one of the cardboard circles onto the skewer and then using some glue. Put some glue on the bottle cap. When that's glued, pop it onto the skewer and push it down and glue it onto the cardboard circle. Now we're just going to add a little bit more glue around the edge of the bottle cap. And push the other circle onto the skewer. Make sure you don't poke your hands. And push them together and there you have your pulley. Now we just need something to pull. So we're going to take that bottle and we're going to cut it in half using a pair of scissors. Now you've got your half plastic bottle and you're going to use the skewer to poke two holes one on each side of the bottle. There's one hole and another hole. Grab some string or thread. Make a little handle for half of the water bottle. Now we're going to cut the other side of the bottle cap. Now we're going to take the other side of the bottle cap and we're going to use the skewer to make sure we don't stick it on the bottle cap. Let the string on. Let's test out the pulley. Now let's test the amazing pulley powers of our homemade pulley. Let's balance it between two objects. Put the string through the pulley and pull. Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull. And here comes our cup. Woohoo! It works! It's our homemade pulley. You
