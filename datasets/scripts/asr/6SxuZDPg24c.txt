 This is a brand new shirt with a tagless tag. After you wash them, they get very cracked and crunchy and itchy and horrible. I'm going to demonstrate that if I just peel it, try to peel it off with my finger. Nothing happens. This is some Wintergreen oil from Uncle Harry's. I bought it for $2.15 at Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco. I'm going to open the Wintergreen oil. Apply it to the shirt. Let it sink soak in for a few seconds. After about 20 seconds, not much is happening. Add a little bit more. Hold it over until it's soaked in. Rub it. I'm just using my finger now. I'm going to use a little bit more force. I'm going to use a little bit more force. If somebody else was holding the camera, I'd be able to apply a little bit more force. I have a camera stand. I'm going to pull this a little bit tighter. I'm just sorry. I know you can't see. That's a little bit more force.
