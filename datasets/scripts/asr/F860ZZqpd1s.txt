 Mandalins are useful in the kitchen, but know they have a very sharp blade and they must be used correctly to avoid injury. Most mandalins will come with a stand so that it can work on an angle. Make sure the mandolin is stable on your work surface and adjust the blade to the correct slice with setting. Your mandolin should have come with a guard. Use it. Besides your design to keep the guard on its correct path, well sharp teeth under the handle keep food in place while you slice. First, let's try a cucumber. Pierce the cucumber on the guard's teeth. Check that it is nicely stuck on there. Get a good grip on the mandolin's handle, put the guard and cucumber back on the mandolin and make sure any fingers and thumbs are away from the cutting surface. Start slicing, running the guard up and down the mandolin blade. Discard any remaining vegetable on the guard. Do not attempt to slice it on the mandolin without using the guard. With little effort, you have perfectly sliced cucumber. Visit at cobloofsandkitchen.com for more tips.
