 Today I'm show you guys how to drive a 13 speed shifter This is a 2017 Peter belt. So basically this is how you do it. Okay All right, so Start off Sure, right you want first Taking off low to side-kin but you normally do it there Four and then you flip splitter Go to fifth gear right here Once you're reaching the higher pms Push this forward once you look at the gas and let go They keep the trouble automatically go into the high gear and then what then you hit the gas again and as you drive it But I mean to high RPM click backwards And go into six you're in six low You want six high Forward like all the gas Wasn't took high six high and then you get the gas again. You're in six high You want to go to seven? Get back about seven here You're on seven high and I'm sorry. You're on seven flow as as you reach in our higher pms Take forward they call the gas and gas again and truck is set to seven high and go all the way to eight same process I was so on so on down shift. So you want to go on 13 low Just backwards They go the gas again they will all make it one to 13 low
