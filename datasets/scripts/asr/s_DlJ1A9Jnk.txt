 Hi, it's Laura from HappyHouseWife.com and I'd like to show you how well the citric acid works and getting the mineral deposits off of me glass tea kettle. So I've got everything set up behind me. I'm going to turn the camera around and show you how it works. Alright, I'd like to show you how well the citric acid works on my tea kettle and I've got the green cutting board behind it just so you can see better because my walls are yellow. This has been used probably four or five times and I don't normally let it get this gunked up but I just wanted you to see how all this works. So let me put a little water in here. Okay and you can see the mineral deposits are still on there and this is the citric acid how it comes with Azure standard. It's a five-pom bag and then I just transfer it into a little jar. So let me get my scoop out. This is a two-table spoon scoop. I probably use about half of it in the dishwasher but really I just need a little bit in the in the tea kettle. So maybe a teaspoon teaspoon and a half and let me just push it around. Look at that. All of the mineral deposits are gone. I made them for the water out so you can see. And look how nice and clean that is. I love this stuff.
