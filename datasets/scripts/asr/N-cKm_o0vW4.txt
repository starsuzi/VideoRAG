 Hi everybody! Hi! So today we're going to do a very cool science experiment with balloons. We're going to use some household products. We have some white vinegar and we have some baking soda. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull the whole bottle evenly between the three bottles because they're pretty tall. So let's see here one. It's going down. I'll do that one. Yep, okay so that's a good amount. And then I'll go to the middle one. Okay and now I will go to the last one. I think you got the most lady. I have four little bit in here and the rest in here. Maybe I might have the best balloon. Okay so we got all of our vinegar pour. And now we're going to fill our balloons up and we have some nice tie-dye marble style balloons. We're going to fill them up with the baking soda. So Jay, since yours is on the left, yep the baking soda. You hold the funnel in the balloon and I am going to scoop some in at a time because they pump up easily. Make sure it falls through. There we go. Alright let's see. You got a good amount in there. So I'm going to place the balloon over the bottle very gently. And now I'm going to move over to the middle one. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to put a top on mine. There we go. Alright so we're going to pour it over the funnel. Let's see. See? I'm going to put it in. Let's get some more yours. Okay I think we can pour the rest in here for you. Alright. Alright so we have all of our balloons with the baking soda and we have our bottle of vinegar. You're ready to inflate some balloons? Ready? Everybody grab that balloon and one, two, three. Let's see what happens. There it goes. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. I'm going to put it. It's filled with vicar inside. There we go. That was cool. That was cool. That was cool. Let me see. Oh my still got vinegar in the tube. Mine too got white. So the best thing about this size experiment is that you get the bottom of the balloons when you finish. So Jay, you want to pop yours first? Yeah. Alright. Go ahead here yours. Alright. Alright I'm going to pop mine. Alright I'm going to pop mine. Let me pop yours. Okay you ready? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Good. Bye everybody. Bye everybody. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
