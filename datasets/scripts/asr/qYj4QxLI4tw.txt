 So we're gonna start making a chalk chart. Okay? And first of all, what we're going to do is we're going to figure out what kind of chalk we have in the house that needs to be done. So what kind of chalk do we have? We have some soup in the flow. What does we have? Dusting. And I think that's all the chairs we have. So sweeping the floor. Who is doing sweeping the floor? Usually it does sweep in the floor. Mmm, big sis. Okay, so big sis does sweeping the floor. Who does turning off the light? Who does turn off the light? Mmm, okay. Little sis turns off the light. And then wipe it down the table. I think little sis should do that. MD took trash. I think you should do that. Anybody dust? Everybody. Mmm. So I'm gonna turn the 8 by 11 or no more of these people. Sorry. I'm gonna turn the paper this way. And I'm just gonna put stickers down this line on this side for the week. So Monday, this is Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday, Friday, and this week Saturday. And then we'll draw a line going across. Okay. So it's choice that you guys are gonna do. So I'm gonna make it tickers on to the screen. Mmm. So now we have our chart. And we're gonna start putting... Is that your chart? Yeah. Where's your chart? I'm not done. You're not done? I just need to put it in the top. Okay. So now we have to put the dates. So I'm gonna start writing the dates. And this will be Sunday. So Saturday. Is that the right spelling of Saturday? Yes. Okay. So that's the date. And now we have the churros. Okay. So this is it. So here we're just gonna fill in your names. And that's it. And what I'm also gonna do is I'm gonna make copies of this. Okay. So that we will have a lot of copies. And we don't have to make this for every week. So what's gonna happen is that when each person does their chart, we'll put a sticker. Okay. We'll put a sticker right there. So... Oh, oh. I think I made a mistake. This Sunday. Sunday we're not gonna do anything because Sunday is the day of rest. So Sunday we're not gonna do anything. So I'm gonna shade that in. What happened when on the seventh day, what did God do? And show them that he... Maybe... No? On the seventh day, what happened on the seventh day? Did they have rest? Yeah. So we too, we're gonna rest on the seventh day. I was just gonna do the sixth and seventh day. Yeah. On the seventh day, so I'm wiping off Sunday. Yay. It's Sunday. It's Sunday. Oh. No, today's not Sunday. Okay. So if you guys do all your charts at the end of the week on Sunday, you guys can have a special treat. And a special treat could be, we could go somewhere or we could do some crafts or we could do something that you want. Okay. The treat depends on whatever daddy and mommy decides. Okay. So that's what we're gonna do. So we're gonna make sure, and I'm not gonna be repeating myself. I say, oh, did you do your charts? Oh, did you put away the trash? You will know that you need to do it. On the third, girls? Understood. Comes up. Comes up. Comes up this video. It might come in and you might need this. Somebody wants stickers. Yay. One thing with children is this. You do not know how much responsibility you can give a child until you give the child that responsibility.
