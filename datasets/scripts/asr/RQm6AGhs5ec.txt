 Want to show you guys a product that I use? This is called dry out. I pick it up at I think Walgreens or right-aid or something and All it is is a dehumidifier Now this container is filled with all these little plastic BB looking things Kind of looks like Tanner right Or a laundry soap and they're like powder plastic BBs, you know like made out of chalk Anyway, you take the lid off and you put it in your safe and what it does is it absorbs all the moisture If you look at this It's kind of hard to see on my camera But it is filled up with liquid This is all the moisture this thing has absorbed here and about I guess about three weeks time and They do a good job. They last you know several months Three four months probably but I'm gonna pour this out and show you All the water this thing has Has gathered here So what happens is it gets hard and Turns into a solid block But that's the dehumidifying Powder that's in here and it works excellent. We have fish tanks in the house So our house is a little more You know has more humidity. It's a little more moist than other houses because of our fish tanks So I need something like this so my weapons don't rust up in the safe So I place this on top of my safe and it does a darn good job of taking all the moisture out of the air and This is just about all I use so Anyway, this is like three or four bucks maybe even five bucks the most but if it'll save your gear from getting rusted up I think it's a really good investment And one of these containers like I said last several months so check out this company or anything like this and It works awesome. It's a great product and I've tried it out and you know, I don't spend money unless I have to so When this time you're at Walmart or any of your local grocery stores or whatever See if they have any of this stuff and just crack the lid throw it on top of your safe or wherever you keep your weapons or Anything else you don't want to get rusty and it'll do a darn good job
