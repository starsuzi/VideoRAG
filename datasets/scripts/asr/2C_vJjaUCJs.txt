 I forgot I also want to show you guys the breakdown of the Kabella Pro Mee grinder. So I wish I had a tripod. So basically you have to just pull the grinding portion out of the grinder which is pretty simple if you're not me. Okay there it is. And the rest is just the motor. That you don't have to clean it off. This part everything is all self contained. So the top tray pops right off. This part twists. Set this down. Okay. So the front piece here, twists right off. And then you have this kind of like a screen or something like that I guess you'd call it. You can take it with holes in it and they have different size, three different plates for different sized holes. So you remove that. Then you have your blade and it's that little cross looking thing in there. And you pull that out and basically just as you're going wipe the extra meat off of all the parts, you know the fat out of there. And this is messy with the normal. I didn't take enough time to grind everything absolutely out of there. That'll get wrapped around the fittings there. And then you get your inside piece out and that is it. Then you're empty. You just have your, I don't know what you call this thing either. You've got to find the names for stuff. But that's basically all the parts. And I got to say this thing is just a snap to clean. It really is easy and quick and you know very very, it's not a big deal to take it out and grind something real quick for me because the cleanup is so easy.
