 If you're unfamiliar with petoskey stones, these are small, fossilized, coral stones that are found in upper Michigan. And they have a really unique pattern to them that's really exposed when they're wet. So we're going to show you a little trick today to expose that pattern using the amazing clear cast epoxy. So we're going to start out by mixing equal volumes or equal parts of the amazing clear cast. You don't have to worry about air bubbles really for this application so you can mix it pretty briskly and make sure you mix it well, scraping the sides of your cup, the bottom of the cup, and your stick. We have a little silicone pad here. If you don't have that, it's not necessary. You can use something like wax paper to set the rocks on once you have them coated. But you're simply going to take where some gloves, dip your finger and they have amazing clear cast and simply wipe it all over the petoskey stones. As you wipe it, you'll see that pattern reappear and that's really what we're looking for to try to illuminate with these rocks. Once they're all coated, simply let them sit overnight to cure. And when they're completed, they'll be a high gloss finish illuminating the full accents of the stones. They're really cool rocks they can be used for jewelry, paper weights, just whatever you want to use them for.
