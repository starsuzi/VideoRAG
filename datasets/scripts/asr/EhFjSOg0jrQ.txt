 Hi guys! Today I will be teaching you how to blow bubble gum. So what you are going to need is gum in your mouth. And yeah, that's it. I am using copper bubble. It's just white because I just took out all the flavor. So first what you want to do is, let me get on the center. Okay. So what you want to do first, add a piece of paper. Okay. Okay. So first what you want to do is make it flat. Like this, hold on. Like that. Make it flat on your tongue. And then, you are going to use your mouth using your juxtam mouth. Tie it like this, do it off. Yeah, so try to get it off but don't make a hole in it or the... You know, make a big, big disaster. So, flatten it. And then, try to cut it out. So, let me show you what it looks like. So, that's what's going to look like. Let me do it one more time. Yeah, it's a beer. I was about to get sting. Can you see that? Can you see that? Any time. Can you see that? Yeah. So, flatten it on your tongue. And then, try to take it out and then, just blow. So, try to take it out. Make sure that it lets look like this and then, just blow. Or, as you don't get that, there's another way how you can do it. Make sure that it's super soft and not sticky. So, keep chewing it like this. Okay, make sure that you hear that noise. Then, take it out. Oh, it's almost done. And then, cut it out. And then, stretch it out. And then, cut it out. And then, cut it out. So, stretch it out. Then, put it on your mouth. And then, you go to blow. Press down. And then, roll it out. And then, just put it out. And then, your face will get a little messy. That's okay. Okay. Okay. So, I'll just slow motion. And then, I'll do the medium. Okay. I'll do the medium. No medium, faster, anything, right? So, I'll do it three more times. Two more. Okay. One more. Okay. One more. Okay. So, flatten it. Try not to make a hole. Try to take it off. And then, blow. And then, just put it on your mouth. And then, just put it on your mouth. And then, just put it on your mouth. And then, just put it on your mouth.
