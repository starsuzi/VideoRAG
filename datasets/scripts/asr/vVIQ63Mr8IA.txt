 We're still wagon to Stirlery, Devil's own rum, and then we have whiskey run, single malt whiskey, and whiskey run, bourbon whiskey is what are two whiskeys that we'll be doing. So this is the rum wash, and it is comprised of molasses, cane sugar, and then of course water, yeast, some nutrients to help the yeast do their job. And then right now this is the finished wash, so it has about a 10% alcohol by volume. Then the wash gets pumped over here to be preheated, then it saves me a lot of time, otherwise it takes about four hours for that to heat up. It's about 170 degrees, so that vapor coming off is alcohol vapor, that's why I have a lid on here. And then we pump the wash that's being preheated over there over here. And it's three folds, monitor the temperature of the pot, the column, and the head. And then it's fully condensed, and then completely liquefied comes out here. And it's going to come over into this tank. So this is the, what they call the low wines, which is a concentrated wash in essence. Depending how a product is still, sometimes it will be distilled multiple times, we do two distillations. One, to concentrate the alcohol and the flavor into the low wines, and then the final distillation is the product. We seek our rum. All the color of our product comes from the barrels, from the aging process. This is our rum base. So this is from here, it'll either get the spices added to make a spice from. It'll be aged for a short term, and then filtered to become a white rum, or we aged, and then bottled for our gold rum, or aged a lot longer for our dark rum.
