 Getting a land survey is a pretty simplistic process. I'm Richard Blake and I'm here to explain to you how to get a land survey. A great place to start is your local yellow pages as well as the internet. Simply type in land survey with your local city or the place where the property is located. You should get a list of surveyors readily available. Another good place that you can go to is your local title company or a law office that does real estate closings they generally have surveyors on hand that they can recommend you to that they've done transactions within the past and know that they're going to do a good job for you. When the surveyer shows up just make sure that they've got the proper certifications and licensing for your state and there shouldn't be any problem. A couple items that will help to bring or that you can give to the surveyer which made actually decrease your cost in this survey or any past surveys that you have a purchase agreement if you are purchasing a new property as well as any items that might have been removed from the property such as fence lines etc etc. Again really all you need to do is contact your local real estate agent or your local title company or lawyer who does real estate closings ask them for a reputable survey company and they'll be able to come out right away and give you a survey and again you'll get a discount if you give them any historical information on the property. Okay I'm Richard Blake thank you for your time you have a great day.
