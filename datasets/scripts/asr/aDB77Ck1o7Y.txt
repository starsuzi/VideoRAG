 Hi, I'm Drew from How To Cook Like Your Grandmother. And today I'm going to show you a little bit about how to use a paring knife. And usually I like to use the biggest knife that I can. Of course I'm compensating for any shortcomings. I think it's usually easier to use a bigger knife if you can. For some things though, you need a smaller knife, like for instance, cutting the core out of a tomato. Now for this technique, you're going to be holding most of the blade inside the palm of your hand. So this is not something you want to be teaching to your five-year-old. Although if you've got a five-year-old and she's making her own lunch, can you tell me how you got that to work? Because I got a seven-in-the-nine-year-old and I've been trying to get them to make their own lunch and they are just not cooperating. Daddy! Oh, hi girls. It's the girls. I didn't realize you were standing there. Okay. Yeah, pairing knife and tomato. Okay. Now, to cut the core out, lay the knife in your fingers so that your thumb is right at the tip. Hold onto as much of the handle as you can and then turn it sideways. Take the tip and slice it in right next to the core and put your thumb in the middle. Now rotate the tomato with your other hand so that you're digging the core out with the tip. You're using the knife, the thumb, to make sure the tip doesn't go in too far. And there you've got the core cut out of the tomato. Hi, I'm Drew from How To Cook Like Your Grammeler and today I'm going to talk a little bit about it. Let me show you a little bit.
