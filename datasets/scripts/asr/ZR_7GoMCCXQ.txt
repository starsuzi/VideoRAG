 It's funny how memories of our youth kind of shape how we perceive things with food in the future I don't know about you, but if you lived in you know the United States or maybe more importantly in Minnesota We heard the word gulash even Hungarian gulash you would think of kind of a macaroni hot dish Well, I got to tell you gulash is not a macaroni hot dish But it is great and today we are going to make someone Gary and gulash on cook like a bastard So the make-congering gulash and gulash is effectively a soup that we're making here We talk a little bit about some of the ingredients we're using We're going to start with some beef cubed up, you know about an inch by an inch Some carrots, potatoes, tomato, onion, parsnips, we have some pepper I'm using hot red paprika, I'm saying pepper And some bay leaves, some garlic, some salt, pepper, some celery root, some paprika These are little dumplings we're going to show you how to make And some carrots, we're going to make this all together, it's going to take about an hour and a half, two hours to make And it's very very tasty So I'm going to start by heating up some oil in my pan And then we're going to saute two cups or so of onions in there It's going to be really tasty, I guess a minute already Alright so our oil is heated up here, I was using avocado oil today It stands a little more heat, it's a little more friendly in the kitchen At least when you're cooking with cameras and everything So I take a couple cups of onions I see the oil is pretty hot And put them in here And now we're going to be sauteing these guys until they become translucent And then we're going to be putting some of the hot paprika in it Then after about five minutes or so, the onions are about done You can see that they're getting a little bit clear here And I'm starting to brown just a smidgen I'm going to add the paprika This is hot paprika And you want to coat the onions with this And once we get this in and feel like the onions are coated properly Just going to add just a little bit of water, not much, just a touch If you're making more of a sauce right now than a soup Just a little bit more in there I'm going to make sure that you get all this mixed up Just a little bit of heat down, just a little bit of seeing it too hot This is my center of bowl, burners the hot one So be careful on it, just smidgen more water See how this is working up? You can see this here that it's really just kind of a sauce Like a very thick spaghetti sauce maybe Then once you got that done, we add four bay leaves Let me add some pepper We add some salt I like to use pink salt, pink salt is the official salt of cocoa like a bastard And coagulate bastard studios And some caraway seeds, maybe a teaspoon or so To taste So let's mix all these guys together here Once you got your sauce already We're going to put in the beef Now this was a chuck that I cut up But you know whatever you want, you want kind of a well muscled meat Because the, that's going to turn in the gelton that you create That's going to turn into a nice thick or broth for you when you get the goulash done And I'm going to just add another touch of water Just to make sure the meat is all coated Then we let this sit for about an hour as it cooks down You'll know the meat is going to become very tender Then we add the vegetables And we have a great cooking goulash here on cook Like a bastard While you're laying the meat cook for about a half hours Good time to chop up your vegetables We'll use a couple carrots here Let's break them into 1.5 inch slices And I have a fairly big carrot here, so to speak So I'm going to just cut some of these in half again Remember it's good when you're making things that people are going to eat And not cut to make them at least bite-sized Good tip, huh? So let's take a couple of parsnips here I actually use three parsnips because these are kind of small Cut off the ends And think about making them about the same size as your carrots Let me take two potatoes Or I peeled these, these are those magical peel-less potatoes And the potatoes, again, all you think should be about the same size Different shapes, but generally the same size because they make a much better goulash We're making Hungarian goulash here on cook like a bastard today Not the type your mom made Well, maybe if you're from Hungary, probably a good chance of that I was talking to my mom yesterday telling her about the show we're cooking in So yeah, she was making goulash and yep, she told me the recipe that I expected she might You know, the creamettes and hamburger and tomatoes and stuff And I can see how the essence of that might actually be there But this is a real Hungarian goulash And we learned to make when we took a couple of cooking classes when we were in Budapest recently We'll take three cloves of garlic and we need to smash these cats to see how that works for us Well, that's the end of the work, okay, let's get over that side and get hit by it That one worked too And here's our smashing with a little ambitious, I'm going to actually add one more clove Because I calculated about three quarters of the garlic went on the floor So I got this big thing here, what the heck is this? Well, this is a celery root and use more for flavor So we're going to clean this thing off here, cut off the end And you can cut off both ends here And then I'm going to cut it in quarter because I put a big chunk in it, then I'm going to peel it after I quarter it So cut the ends, again, this is just to add flavor You're probably not going to be eating this but you're going to be tasting it And this is celery root You want to leave it in a big enough chunk because you're going to be removing it before you serve it And take one or two tomatoes And then cut these into small sections And really a good tip is take the labels off before you cook them You can clean them and they still stick, you know that's a good label Quality labels here, nothing but the best that's cooked like a basket, so you just say We want tomatoes, you can't make tomatoes good anymore of course But you can put damn good labels on them, keep those labels because it's the best boy we have right here It's traveling, learning a few things in Europe It was amazing just to actually taste the good tomatoes again So do what you can, find some good tomatoes, grow them at home Do what you can but tomatoes should be good We like good tomatoes, so these guys are going to be sitting here And what we're going to do is we're going to put them in and after about a half hour cooking the meat So our meat has been cooking for about a half hour and we're going to put our vegetables in here As we're potatoes and parsley next and carrots and smash garlic and murder celery root Once we get this all in, mix it up Now it's going to sit for another half hour here While these guys cook, pretty easy, pretty goulashy as I like to say And then after about another half hour add about double the amount of water we had in before So we're going to let this go for another 15-20 minutes that we're going to put the Chappet Cayenne And we're going to have some goulash, whoa! And it's good smell and goulash, too bad you don't have smell of it Just say And the final step, well not with the final step because we get to eat it at first But it's adding the Chappet Cayenne and this is going to sit in here for about 15 minutes or so That's some good smell and goulash Hungarian goulash, let's see what we've done with all of this Now this has been a great little soup we've been making here This is a authentic Hungarian goulash, learn how to make this at the Chef Parade School in Budapest And it has tomatoes and potatoes and carrots and parsnips and beef And little tiny dumplings that we made Don't forget the celery root Don't eat it though It's just for flavor This is good, the dumplings are tender, the beef is tender The broth is delicate yet flavorful, what a great meal Just like most of them here at Cooks Like a bastard
