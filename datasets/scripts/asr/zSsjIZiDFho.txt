 Hi guys and welcome back to my channel. Today I have a review for this cool gel memory foam pillow. I have wanted one of these for so, so, so long. I don't know what it is about cold pillows but if there's a cold pillow I can fall asleep so quickly and I am a long time sufferer of allergy problems and sinus infections you might even be able to hear it my voice currently I have a sinus infection going on so when I have that a lot of times I just feel warm my face feels warm and I always explain that's my mom and she never understands it but I will wake up in the middle night and keep flipping back and forth my pillow to find like the cool spot on it because that's what makes me feel comfortable and helps me sleep. So I got one of these in the mail it's kind of hard to fit it on camera but the box is rather small let's open it for you show you what it looks like I'm going to use it for a while and then tell you my thoughts about it we would even came with a comfort relax sleep mask that's cute so the sleep mask comes in this little bag it's adjustable so that's a little freebie that comes with that they package this really well oh it's nice and thick so it's white on one side flip it over and you can see the gel oh I know I'm gonna love this I can already tell so I'm gonna let that kind of expand and settle for a moment let's see what this is comfort relax memory foam pillow I love to hear from you in case you experience an odor which is a fresh foam odor it's not harmful I do smell a little something but yeah it just smells like foam it's not very strong it should dissipate within 48 hours when the foam is unpacked and aired out so you can unzip it take a look at the inside there's a memory foam and it has this blue gel on top of it it looks and feels just like one of those gel i masks so excited for this I'm gonna go ahead and let it air out like it said to do on the card use it for a while and then I will be back to give you my thoughts about this okay so it's been several days I went ahead and put just a regular pillowcase that matched my other ones and I tried to count to see how long my regular pillow stays cool versus this one so my regular pillow it stayed cool for about 10 seconds or so after laying down on it and then it kind of warmed up to my body temperature this one I actually lost track counting because I fell asleep I'm not joking I love cool pillows I could sleep so easily with them so this definitely does stay cooler a lot a lot longer than a standard pillow and it is a memory foam and I guess it's about the standard thickness of a memory foam pillow so yeah I definitely do like this it does stay cool for a very long time so this is awesome if you guys would like to order one I will leave a link below and as always thank you so much for watching bye guys
