And it is about it is 4.50, almost 5 o'clock. And this is the first time I'm eating. And what I'm going to be eating today is I'm going to be eating some pig feet. Have you ever had any pig feet?

This is fresh cabbage. And it's got pieces of salt pork in it. I don't care if you're familiar with salt pork, but pieces of salt pork. And then you see how juicy it is. So I'm going to put that on my plate. So we got our cabbage. This is what we're starting with. Okay. And then I've got some corn here. Some whole kernel corn and some cream style corn. And then I made myself some cornbread. These are just corn is cornmeal. And I fried it up. I love. I love the taste. Oh, it's so good. So crunchy. So you know what? I can't talk anymore.
