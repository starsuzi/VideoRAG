 Hello friends, how are you? I hope you are doing great. I want to show my two new family members. This one is Amla Indian Gooseberry and this little one is Laiji. I put its seeds right here and it takes the 15 day to grow up. I have another one Laiji here and I want to show its seed. This is actually the Amla seeds. If you grow the Amla from this seed it will take a lot of time. So what I did I cut it and took out its seed and then I put it in the my pot to get growing. Now let me show you its seeds too. For that I have to cut it and I have to hold my video for some time. I'm coming back. Okay now if I cut it from here let us see what is in this. Here we have little seeds. This is the Amla seeds. What you have to do actually is if you want to grow it which I would personally suggest you that you are bringing the fruit at your home and do not buy the seeds from outside. These are actually if I tell you the truth the seeds coming out of my Amla candy. I keep this big seed in store and this is the June month here and the rainy season is also. I cut these seeds and I take out these small seeds and just put in the soil and I would get this baby and I am very happy to get this and same here. This is the fruit of Liji. I bought it to eat and I keep it in seeds and I grow it. Okay I would suggest that if you are going to grow it just put all the seeds all together because not all of the seeds will shoot up. Only one or two will get here. I have put three or four seeds and I get only one. So it is better that in one hole by maintaining some gaps in between them of 5 mm or 10 mm according to your space. So you can get the healthy plant here. Now when it would get a little bit bigger than I will, you should fit one other pot. So guys thanks a lot for watching this. Thank you.
