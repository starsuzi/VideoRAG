 Ok, good day for hence. I would like to show you how to draw a short paper and an auto card. So let's begin. For some, I would love to show you a sample. Let's... I have one here. And some one of my clients. So, you can see we have the distance and you can do it at which they are intercepts. So, let me get an auto card file for all the quadruple. So, let me see my own. Oh, yeah. Ok. You can see an sample here. Very, very irregular sight. But you can see very blind. You can draw the right. So, firstly, you can click the line. Then on this coin, you can click anywhere. Then, come to the correct line. And let's start with this. That would be 5,000, 500,000, 90,000. And just hold down the shift button and the two buttons, number two button. Then, in here, we are going to IP 5000, 500,000, 90. Then, to get to the duty, hold down the shift button and the lesser than the button. That is the button we are. Besides, the alphabet M. Then, quite as far as to not type in the duty, to 64 degree. Then, 264. Then enter. See? Then, my way to button is taking you to the continuous alphabet. Again, we are going to input 24 meters. Longer. Then, go to shift button and the number two button. Then, input 24,000, M. Then, hold the shift button and the lesser than the button again. Then, input the duty. That's 12,000, 90,000. That's 1,000, 90,000. Enter. See? What coin somewhere? Then, you can go again. Move to the next one, which is 26 meters. That's the 26,000 limiters. Hold down the shift button and the outputting. Now, type in 26,000. Then, hold down the shift button and less than button. That's less than the input duty. This is 1,000, 90,000. Enter. Go in some way again. Put down the shift button and the outputting again. And, come here. Now, 27.99 meters. That's 27.99 zero. Then, put down the shift button and less than button. Oh, yeah. Now, I have put in 39 degrees. That's 39 degrees. Or, move down. Maybe like that, she won't join like this zone. So, 23.05 meters. That's, hold down the shift and add button. Then, input 22.05.0. And then, hold down the shift and less than button. Hold the input, the width, that's 309 degrees. Then, we find inputting. And, input. I'm simple, we are done. Feond, take. Got to take. First, we shot. Okay, we check your left, transfer. And then, we are 24. Take, we are 26. How we are? That's 36. We are 27.99. 27. And here, we have 22. We have 22 here. So, we want it to, thus, D is this shift. So, thus, after we will get that, we take a dead button. And, we are leaving now, the ovenage, it should be here. 10.00. Well, thank you for watching. Let's see. Thank you for watching.
