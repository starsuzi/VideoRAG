 Hello, welcome to my weekly vlog, Debra Kierzart Journey. Today I had this issue, I have this beautiful denim shirt that I love that was full of paint and I had to get it out. I had to go to my last resort cleaning method and so I thought I'd share with you sort of the process over the years that I've come to use when I get oil paint on my clothing. This is not for acrylics, oil paint and I can't get it out. What I do is if I'm wearing my clothes, Sam, giving a demo or I'm out in public and I don't want to take them off to wash them or anything, there's this neat product called Kiss Off and if you catch your paint when you first notice it when it's not quite dry yet and you use this a lot of times like if you have it on your jeans or something you can get it off right away right on the spot and it comes just like a little chapstick or something where you just rub it onto your clothing and then hopefully rub it off with a paper towel and take the paint off with it. The next thing I would do is go to Gampsaw, trusty Gampsaw usually because especially if I'm out in the field I've got my solvent right there with me and again you know this was on denim so if you've got delicate things in your closet and you're wearing them to paint probably you need to do a fabric test on that before you follow anything, any of my things that I do but everything in my closet is machine washable. Then the next thing I go to if it's still I still can't get it out is this Turpenoid natural and if it's got any moisture at all in it usually the Turpenoid natural will do a number on it for me and this is it comes in a green can as well as this nice little spray dispenser and then I go to Pine Sal if it's still in there and it's not softening up for me I try the Pine Sal this is an oil-based cleaner and sometimes that works. For brushes my favorite cleaner if you've accidentally left something overnight and it's still a little bit wet but it's pretty much gonna trash your brush is this Studio Soap and it's Jack's Linseed Studio Soap the world's best brush soap safe non-toxic low odor it's from Richardson.com and it does amazing things for brushes that I've dried up that you know you drop them underneath the counter or something and don't find them for a couple of weeks and then you're trying to figure out if you can save them or not if they're gonna be saved usually this is what will save them for me. My last resort which I had to go to today because what happened was this shirt I got oil paint on it didn't know it I laundered it so it went through the washer and the dryer so I mean this the stuff that was on here was bone dry and guess what? D-natured alcohol took it out so D-natured alcohol and again this is undenum so you probably don't want to be doing this on lace or something with a Phillips head screwdriver got in there and scrubbed it right in it is new hope that's a good tip for you we'll see you next week
