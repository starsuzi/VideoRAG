 Hi guys, Kathy's wife here. I'm sorry it's been a couple of days but I've just been in one of those moods where I haven't felt like cooking. So honestly I haven't and yeah my lighting's a little bad. I'm gonna try to adjust here and I normally cook on this burner over here but today I'm cooking on this burner but just for this first few minutes I'm gonna show you what I'm doing here. Today I'm gonna make a chicken spaghetti type dish that's gonna end up being baked. So what I did here was I took four enormous chicken breasts and I chopped them into small pieces not bite-sized just I guess they are bite-sized but they're they're fairly small about maybe I don't know I guess the size of a molar you know or maybe the top knuckle of your thumb and salt pepper some garlic powder dehydrated chives dehydrated parsley dehydrated onions and just this sprinklest sprinkle of cayenne for just a little bit of pow and I will be back when I have the chicken completely cooked and we will go from there because we are going to make a cheese sauce. Okay guys once your chicken is cooked then make sure this booms not over the point then you take remember there was a coupon I'm still dealing with that Skinner pasta this is 24 ounces so I guess that's what two pounds and I'll wait 16 ounces to make a pound. Well this is 24 ounces of Skinner Thins spaghetti and yes this is the same pan I cooked the chicken with I just felt like adding the water to it and making it kind of like a one dish one pot meal and I didn't rinse it or anything because the seasonings from the chicken and the chicken itself will flavor the broth or the water even though we're just going to drain the water but I'm just I filled the pan up with some water let it come to a boil and and then we're just going to cook our spaghetti after we add what about a teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons of salt and don't over salt it will be right back in about seven minutes when the pasta is al dente. Okay guys the chicken is in the bowl the spaghetti is in the colander and now we are going to make our mash them out. Now you'll remember we made this with the homemade macaroni and cheese and I thought my arm was going to fall off so here's what we're going to do in the same pan that we have taken all of the spaghetti out of and dried completely we're going to melt that butter and then when that butter melts we are going to add two and we're actually going to add a fourth of a cup of flour and then we are going to add two and three fourths cup of milk and no the husband isn't home so I am free to use the whisk in the Teflon pan all right that's about as melted as it's going to get and I am going to sprinkle this evenly over the butter and starch is stirred and I don't know if you guys remember but from watching the macaroni and cheese I wondered why it lumped up on me this way okay um we're going to let this I'm going to continually stir it so that these little bits don't you know get juke brown get away from me but um I wonder why it clumped up on me and then I realized normally when I make a roux I use olive oil or I use like vegetable or canola oil and this is butter so this is going to be you know it's going to be different I mean that just occurred to me that I normally use oil in my eyes they're remember you just you don't want to cook this for too long just you know about a minute or you know so just to cook the raw taste of flour out of there and then let's just for the sake of time say it's been a minute because I don't be like waiting the minute now remember we had the problem last time where I didn't I wasn't patient enough okay well I'm gonna add the milk slowly because the last time when I made the macaroni and cheese I had a hard time getting that milk up to temperature fast enough for you guys so we'll do it slow as molasses this time so make sure you get all those lumps out of there oh that's actually nice it looks pretty silky that is up to temperature and I am going to break off here for just a minute to shred my cheese and ask my son how it went getting his iPad replaced and we're back and here we go he just needed a hard reset down on that iPad now keep stirring until you see it start to get picked like a cheese sauce and here I go again I don't want to bore you guys with watching me make this special but also we'll bring you back when it's time to add the cheese okay back up where it needed to be in about 45 seconds and while I was done well this was whisking and thickening while I was whisking and this was thickening I'm sorry I don't know where my mind is today I was finishing up shredding the cheese and today I am going to be using monster shredded monster and shredded breed now I don't normally use breed in cooking that is normally one of those high-falutin cheeses you know oops but my mom found two of these for a dollar and I wouldn't and I know a a lot of you know this but I'm sending you down it comes with a rind on it it is completely optional if you want to take the rind off um I did not I just shredded both um both of these see super but um I just shredded both of these that is really got me turn that fire off now you're gonna shred you're gonna want four cups three for your bachamel and this is three this is um what 24 ounces or no I'm sorry this is 12 ounces of breed and another eight ounces of shredded monster that doesn't want to go anywhere for me now like I said I don't normally use breed in cooking because it's just too expensive to use for something like chicken spaghetti but I have with a heck for a buck and it gives my mom great joy when I use the food that she gives me you know to make recipes and stuff it brings her great joy and it also brings her great joy to get on the computer and hear me say my mom this and my mom at so my mom gave me this cheese and so now we have this sauce and thanks to my mom as I love my mom she lives next door with my dad I love my dad too um um there you go now if you want to have um I'm sorry I didn't tell you this in the beginning you're gonna want to go ahead and preheat your oven to um 400 and that's about as smooth as I want it so now what I'm gonna do is add some scatty yeah but I didn't toss it with any butter or anything and you can see now that I should have pulled out some kind of oil olive oil sesame oil something well I don't know about these sesame oil I would have given it some depth of flavor but really that's why I'm gonna love an Asian player and set that aside and I'm gonna add oh wow that's tasty I'm gonna go ahead and add my chicken remember that's four seasoned chicken breasts and at this point I am going to put my spoon away and I am going to toss with tongs until evenly distributed just like we did with the mac and cheese recipe just get the sauce incorporated the chicken incorporated and I decided to make this because I figured out we're sick of seeing the meat mix it can be next week I am in a couple of days here I am gonna break off and um and I'm gonna start cooking with whole grain so um if you've got vulgar or barley or tvp anything along those lines um pull it out you can cook along you can follow my recipe and let me know if it was a hit or a mess we tree bonsai gave me two dehydrators so the next time you see dehydrated parsley in my hand it will be because of we tree she gave me two dehydrators I'm gonna start dehydrating my own parsley but until then this is H.E.B dehydrated parsley and I'm gonna put some on top for color and for pretty pretty and then you know what you can even do basil if you really want to and uh let's see here what was I can oh yeah just so that um just to keep that basil from going crispy I'm gonna take a little butter flavor cooking spray and just hit everywhere that I have hit with parsley just to keep that from you know crispin up on me and then we are going to put it in the oven and maybe 25 30 cheese that's heavy I'm 25 30 minutes until um it's golden brown and bubbly and delicious so give it just a second here all right we'll see you guys in about 35 minutes okay you guys it's been 35 minutes and remember it's that cheesy bachamel so you need two potholors because that bachamel just makes everything so heavy it's very rich with all that heavy cheese in it oh my gosh that looks awesome oh my goodness hold on I'll get y'all closer up look at that isn't that pretty it's golden and yellow and greenish here and there and I love looking at the looking at the edges right here look at that how it's bubbling that is freaking awesome awesome awesome awesome make it you'll like it
