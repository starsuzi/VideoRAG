 Hey guys and welcome to another episode today. I'm going to show you how to clean OEM wheels to make them look like they're brand new again Now these wheels belong to Alexis IS 250 that I'm doing the brakes on now I'm installing new brake rotors new pads and I'm also painting the brake helpers now while the wheels that I have right here While they're off the car I'm going to clean them up and make them look brand new There's a ton of brake dust on these things and these things haven't been given love in a long time now today I'm going to be doing exactly that So right here I've got one of the wheels and this is the dirtiest one that I have of the four now inside the spray bottle I've got the McGuire's wheeled Breitner that's diluted four to one This is the solution that I'm going to be using to break down and eat away at all this brake dust Now once it's all wet and everything this is going to break it down so that I can get my hose and spray it off to make it new Inside my bucket that I have right here. I have two brushes that I use I've got this one that I can get inside any of the cracks inside the wheel and then I've got a paint brush right here That I can agitate any of the surface now. I'm going to stick both of these inside there for a second Get my product get my wheeled Breitner and spray down the entire wheel Let me make sure you do a good job at doing this don't be scared This stuff is not that expensive and it does an amazing job of cleaning up wheels now Keep in mind if you're working with bare aluminum wheels so like something aftermarket this will stain it This will cause the aluminum to react with the acid inside here and you're just going to have to polish it afterwards It's not that big of a deal just keep in mind that this is an acid-based wheel cleaner so don't be scared spray down the entire thing And then get one of your brushes doesn't matter which one you start off with first I'm going to be using this one spray some inside it just like that and then start agitating the wheel And you can see that as soon as you touch it it breaks down the brake dust And makes it look new Do this quick and show you a little section This is doing a very good job at breaking it down and cleaning it up now something to note too is that when you're doing this You don't want to let the cleaner You don't want to let the wheel Breitner dry on the wheel if it does the only way that you can relic or fight and get it to Reactivate again is to spray more of it onto the wheel just like that Now with the wheel being this dirty obviously you might not get everything to first try So if that is the situation if that's the case just go around another time spray down the entire wheel and then agitate all the brake dust to make it come off nice and easy And as you can see this is doing a very good job of cleaning up this wheel Once I spray it down you're gonna notice how much of a difference this thing makes Cleaning your wheels is gotta be probably the best thing that you can do for your car to make it look clean You can have the crappiest car in the world, but as soon as you have clean wheels it'll stand out and it'll actually look nice I'm gonna wash this down Now I don't know if you can see this if the cameras at the right angle, but I missed a couple spots so I can go in with my same brush or I can go in with this one spray this down spray the wheel and Then agitate any of the brake dust still on there Now the beauty of having the wheel off of the car is that I can get behind here turn the wheel around and clean the backside As you can see this is very dirty So with the wheel like this you can get access to any angle and you can maneuver it so you can get all the brake dust off of the wheel Now I'll put links to all the stuff that I'm using today in the description box So if you guys want you guys can pick all the stuff up and basically do the exact same job that I'm doing Now what's really sweet too is that with this brush and the wheel off the car you can get inside all these little lug nuts There it is with the brush and clean it all up Now If you notice where the wheel is right now is actually in the shade when you let The wheel breakener if you let this dry onto the wheel as I said if you want to relic will fight it You want to get some of this stuff and spray down in the wheel now to make your life easy bring it in the shades You don't have to worry about that And after you're done the face you can now do the barrel Now it's the exact same process to spray down And then agitate it all with the brush now in a fast forward I don't think you want to just sit here watching me do this for like 10 or 5-10 minutes So fast forward this and show you guys the result in a minute Spray the wheels in the brush with the Muguayar's wheel breaker Get the barrel of the wheel with the long easy brush and then get the spokes with the harder to reach areas with the paintbrush Now don't be scared to hit it a couple times because this is going to be by far the dirtiest part of the wheel After you're done washing the entire wheel you should go ahead afterwards and give it a little bit of protection Now do that you have to put down wax on it and you can't apply wax on a car or on the wheels when it's wet See other still water on it So come on with a spray gun or towel or something like that and just clean this off and dry it off So we can put wax on the wheel Now what I'm using to protect this wheel is Muguayar's M21 paint sealant You can apply this to a microfiber towel Do the butterfly fold with it So you really spread out the sealant on the applicator pad and then go in and apply the sealant to every part of the wheel Now this is going to protect it and make sure that the water Break dust everything will beat off easier and more likely than as if it wasn't So right now is a bare stock paint And the brake dust is going to stick to this as soon as you start driving with the paint sealant on it It'll prevent it from getting dirty and it'll give it a little bit of protection Put this on here along with the barrel So along the inside of the wheel too apply it on here Let this sit for a good 10-15 minutes come back and then buff all this off with the microfiber towel With the sealant now on here you guys can check out how sweet and easy the water beads off ready check this out See this see how it forms like little droplets This is nice this means that we have protection on this wheel You'll know too that when you dry a sealed wheel you'll know that the water is going to come off and clean off very easily See how fast I just dried that up it took two seconds watch this Water is basically gone If you guys like what you see and you want to see more don't forget to click the
