 We're cleaning carpet at a home where you can see where they have had a rug taped to the floor and the tape residue which did not appear immediately but was left on the carpet over time has attracted dirt. If we clean it the dirt may go away but the residue still remains so the most important stuff is to remove the residue that is attracting the dirt. So we have a stuckle solution that we're going to apply heavily to the adhesive area. We're going to agitate it in thoroughly get all the fibers and then we will rinse it. You can see it comes out 100% if it's done properly. The best way to prevent this so is to make sure that you never place a piece of or tape on the carpet because that typically happens all the time. But if it does call referral and we can help return your carpet to like new conditions.
