 Hey there YouTubers, it's Tom from Tom's Test Kitchen and I really hesitated making this video because it's so simple but I saw a video on the Taste Made network and the woman was showing how to make sweet tea and I thought, are you really need a video showing you how to make sweet tea? And I asked, I was talking to a friend about it work, he's a younger guy and I asked him, yeah that'd be like me shooting a video of how to make sun tea and he looks at me and goes, how do you make sun tea? So he started asking me all these questions, well how long do you leave in the sun? What kind of tea do you use? So here goes, if you know how to make sun tea, just don't bother watching this, if you want to learn how to make sun tea, here you go, you got a half gallon of good water, this is a filtered water that I use and I use three of these, they're called a family size tea bags, they're these large, large tea bags and now this is, Louisiana is one of my favorite brands, I'll get the plant down in there, tea, so I'm just gonna put some of that, put the string a little bit more of the string down in there because it's gonna sink, tea bags will sink once this starts to heat up, so I'm gonna go ahead and put the top on there and then I'm gonna go put this in the sun and I like to put it in a specific place that way no bugs or critters can crawl into it, so I'll be right back and show you where I'm gonna place this. I like to put my tea right up here on the fence post and this picture actually works really great for this because it kind of narrows down and comes and sits perfectly on that fence post, this way this is out of the way, you know if you get kids in the yard or dogs whatever they're not gonna knock it over, so I'm just gonna let that sit out here and I kind of like just eyeball it when it's ready, so I'll be back here in a couple of hours and we'll check it out, okay that tea has been brewing in the sun here in Texas for two hours, it's 101 degrees and that was in the shade so I'm sure it's hotter than that out here, so that tea is ready, it looks ready to me so I'm gonna bring it in and put some sugar in it, okay that tea has been in the sun for two hours so let's make some sweet tea, oh I can just, then I got a trim that plant, squeeze those tea bags, get that back straight, goodness out of there and then got one cup of cane sugar, you can use less if you don't want that much sugar but I like adding the sugar now because this tea is really hot and it'll dissolve completely that sugar, yeah no time to dissolve, so this was in the sun for two hours, if you like it's stronger leave it out there longer but I think that two hours is probably good enough when it's heat, okay I'm gonna bring this inside and kind of like cool down a little bit because it is really hot but then poor glass iced tea, I'm gonna make glass of ice, that's tea, let's pour a glass of sweet suntee, they could limit it, it could limit whatever you like, I don't like anything in my tea but sugar, there you go, looks like a good glass iced tea, oh it's perfect, well you have folks you don't know how to make some tea you do now, that's it, you tube, time out.
