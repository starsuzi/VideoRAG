 Hi, this is Brooke Edmonds at OSU Extension with a garden pest alert. I was out scouting in my garden and noticed that the flower buds of one of my roses have a healthy population of aphids. Aphids feed by sucking plant sap and can damage the future flowers. Management of aphids is relatively easy. You could spray the buds with a stream of water and knock the insects off. But here I'll show you how to use an insecticidal soap. Soaps can be purchased in garden centers. Always read the label first for safety and use shoots instructions. Sometimes you'll have to peel open the back of the label to get all the details. Application is simple if you use a ready-to-use product. Just turn the nozzle to spray or stream and pull the handle. It works quickly to knock the aphids off. Sometimes the aphids are tucked down in the foliage and won't come in contact with the soap. So you'll want to continue to watch these plants and reapply as needed. Thanks for watching and don't forget to scout your own garden weekly to stay ahead of pest problems.
