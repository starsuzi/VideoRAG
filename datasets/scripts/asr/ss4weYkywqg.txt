 Hello, today I'll show you how to prepare the Nigerian grilled or roasted fish. For this recipe you need the fish. This could be any type of fish but the tilapia is commonly used. Then we'll need the mixed spices which have clearly stood out in the link above. And then we need the oil too which also serve as part of the marinade. So let's get cooking. The first step is to clean up the fish from off the scales and the gourd and wipe out excess water with the paper towel. Now make some vertical slashes of cuts on the fish. These cuts will help the marinade penetrate well into the fish. The number of slashes of cuts you make depends on the length of the fish you're using. Set the fish aside and prepare the marinade by adding the oil into the mixed spices. For the mixed spices I'm using black pepper, gallic and onion powder, crushed top cubes, thyme, a little chili pepper and salt to taste. Sometimes I add crushed colliculi and ginger for a nutty and tingling taste but I only do it that today. Mix well and then rub the marinade on and inside the fish making sure that the fish is well covered in the marinade. Now place the fish in a sealed foil or a sieve log bag and leave the fish for about 20-30 minutes. In the meantime, preheat the grill for about 20 minutes then take out the fish from the fridge and place on the hot grill. You can grill the fish in the foil if you want a tender juicy fish but for a flaky fish, place it directly on the grill. Grill is high for about 8-10 minutes until the fish is done depending on how hot your grill is. And now the fish is ready. Do try this recipe and let me hear your feedback.
