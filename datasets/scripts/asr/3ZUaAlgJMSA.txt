 Hi, my name is Kelly Campbell. I am a professional makeup artist and today I'm going to discuss eyeliner colors for teenage girls. I have here a handful of different shades of eyeliner colors. I like to combine two different colors. I like to mix it up a lot and have lots of different options. I think it's good to have a bright color and softer color sometimes at the same time. You don't always have to use the same color eyeliner on the top and on the bottom. Other good choices for teenage girls would be black. I have a black shimmer liquid eyeliner here and a black pencil. Brown is always good. Brown is really a great color for just about everybody. It's a universally flattering color and I also have a blue color here. If you want it to be like an electric blue, really a fun color for teenage girls, this would be a great choice. Again, I'm Kelly Campbell. Thank you so much for watching.
