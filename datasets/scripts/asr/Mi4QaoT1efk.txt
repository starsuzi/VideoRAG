 Hello, welcome to Texas Style Quasine. I'm Chef Johnny and today I'm going to show you how to fry up some eggs You can start on these eggs first thing I'm going to do is add just a little clarified butter to my pan Got my fire going up fires out check my burner here There we go. Let's start heating that up. I'm going to show you two different ways to fry eggs today We're going to do an over easy Which that will lead you to an over medium and an over hard? So that's pretty simple to do and we're going to do a sunny side up eggs for you and Thank you remember on the on the over easy is when you flip them over You're just leaving them over long enough to get them to get the whites to set whites actually set at about 140 degrees takes a little harder than that to get the yolks to set That's why we can get these whites hard But we're going to set the whites flip them over lightly do that side so that we have a runny yolk And of course sunny side up those are running all the way we're going to cook them a little bit lower temperature Take a little bit longer, but we'll get a nice pretty sunny side up egg up with those this pan looks like it is plenty hot I'm going to turn it down a little bit actually Because we don't want to cook this too fast Let's get our eggs on here I'll crack two extra large eggs I'm side by side not cooking too fast And one thing we're going to do is is Once these are kind of set I'm going to get these eggs going this way if this was a clock and six o'clock was toward me I'm going to put the eggs at three and nine that way they don't have to go so high to get over You want to break them a little bit and let some of the yolk come through or some of the white? Nothing wrong with that We'll help it cook a little quicker Now one thing to remember too on your Teflon always use always use rubber spatulas gets us my high heat rubber spatulas use a wooden spoon plastic never put metal in your In your teflon the worst thing you can do to it and don't overheat it not good to overheat teflon either He was we're going to let these cook up get a little more set on the bottom the white cooks at about a hundred and forty degrees So we can get that white cook and our yellow still be nice and running I'm going to have an over easy so it's going to be a nice runny You know even though the the tops cover just a little bit with the hardened whites And again the flip is a circular motion with a little wrist action at the end and we don't want height I'm going to hard time getting these where I want them here we go There we go three and three and nine bring them over it's a nice gentle flip nothing high nothing hard And it won't they don't have to sit there very long just a few seconds and it'll set the white on that side Take my egg I Summer turn this off Pick my egg up and when I pour it out I can It flip them right back over and there are my over easy eggs looking very nice and the reason why I turn this off is this I actually have a metal plate that doesn't hurt. We were having a breakfast bar one morning with my students We had styrofoam plates and they were doing omelets and the young men held the styrofoam plate and went to pour the omelet in right about the time the omelet hit the plate had melted and we Kind of put an omelet all the way down on our burger So if you'll flip that off for a second doesn't hurt anything at all get your egg on at everything's fine. Okay. I'm gonna turn it back on And what we're gonna do now is is some sunny side up big now sunny side up It'll clarify the oil clarified butter Our oil's hot And if you'll notice I keep turning this pan to the side a little bit when there's nothing in it Sometimes he's want to tip a little bit because of the weight of them So I just put them a little bit to the side so the handle doesn't weigh it down Nice hard crack It goes in Okay Once again in the pan the eggs go at three and nine That way they'll cook up good and these are gonna be sunny side up eggs Want these looking nice and pretty You're definitely a presentation egg Sometimes people say they want lace on their eggs if you ever hear them say that what they want is is they want to kind of crisp up on the edges You can do that by using a little bit less oil on my father-in-law That's the way he liked his eggs so when he came over for eggs Very little oil get him cooking Chris about the edge where they start to get a little crusty on the outer edge and that's how cooking them with a lace is But he liked his sunny side up with lace and he has given many a Weight just a hard time over getting those eggs Too cooked Now again, we're not gonna cook this as fast as we do our over-easy Well, we're gonna cook that white all the way through So we're at a little bit lower temperature Now Now these eggs are getting real close to being sunny side up if you look you're still a little bit of Clear on them. We're gonna let them go just a little bit longer But they're nice and yellow up on top I Think our sunny side of up eggs are done Same ways before right out of the skillet onto the plate So there we have them sunny side up Over easy eggs and remember if you want to do over medium or over hard Once you flip them, let them sit a little bit longer. You can also cook a little more on the first side But there's a way to cook over easy and sunny side up eggs.
