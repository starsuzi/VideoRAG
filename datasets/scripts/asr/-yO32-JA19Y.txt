 In this video, I'm going to show you how I remove onion grass, very fast and very, very easy. I'm going to be showing you some of the tools I use, a hammer, a sharpened PVC pipe, a little bit of potting soil, and that long-bloom handle to push out the plug. The broom handle pushes out the plug. The potting soil is after I'm done, I fill in the hole. Here we go. What you're going to be seeing very shortly is I take the PVC pipe and I put it over the onion grass. As you can see here, I've sharpened it to a degree so that it will cut through the ground just a little easier. It's too good a job, but you'll get the idea. Here you're seeing I take the PVC pipe, put it over the grass, the onion grass. I pound it down, oh an inch and a half, two inches. Shake it. If it doesn't come all the way up by itself, I hit it again, couple shots, and normally that gets it all. I'm going to walk over to the camera and show you the plug. The onion grass is in there. All I have to do now is dump it out and save it. Throw it away. Thank you for watching.
