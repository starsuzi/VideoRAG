 You two, slap me my feet, you're my my my my, you're my beauty. Here we're going to look at some tent water proofing spray in this video. This one's by Kiwi Camp Dry. This is their heavy duty water repellent. It's 13% silicone. So it lasts longer, it's tougher, and it's better for water protection. As you can see here, it's the spray style with the cap, with the aerosol spray nozzle there, as you can see. This particular spray is effective on all types of breathable materials, like tents, tarps, and boots as well. As you can see here, it's extremely flamboyal, so I'll be careful when you're spraying it on. The silicone bonds the leather and fabric, and it makes for a waterproof barrier, and it's orderless, after it's dried completely. You can see the performance guarantee and another danger warning there. You can pause if you'd like to go back and read that information. The Camp Dry products have been great on our boots and tents for many years now, so give it a try. Thanks for watching.
