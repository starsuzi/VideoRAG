 Okay, so you can either sew on by bias tape around the armholes like I did. I just made my own bias tape again out of just taking a strip of fabric, folding them both in on themselves one time and then you fold them again and then you just iron that so it kind of makes a little v-thing and then you sew it around the armholes or you can buy bias tape or if you want to do an even easier way, you can just take the fabric that you have, fold it in on itself and pin it right there and then you know even maybe one more time do it one more time and then sew that around so that the fabric doesn't fray and that you've got a finished edge on the outside. Either way works perfectly. I did the bias tape just because I think it looks a little cleaner but both ways work just fine. Once you have both sides with their finished edges around the armholes, we are going to make the rough hole for each side. So you need to grab your contrasting fabric and I'm going to show you how to make the rough hole next.
