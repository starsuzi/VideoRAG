 If your GE Bottom Frieza refrigerator has misaligned doors, the following process will assist you in leveling them. Before beginning, place a hand on the corner and attempt to rock the refrigerator to check for firm contact between the floor and the leveling legs. If it does rock, adjust the cabinet leveling legs using pliers to position the cabinet solidly on the floor. Once the cabinet is positioned solidly on the floor, open the bottom freezer drawer to expose the leveling screws underneath the right and left hand doors. Locate the leveling screw on the right hand door. During the quarter inch allen wrench, adjust the leveling screw to bring the door into alignment with the other door. If the leveling screw comes to the end of its range of adjustment, you will feel it tighten and turning will become harder. Do not attempt to force it to turn more. Note that if lowering, the door may have to be opened between adjustments for the door to lower into its new position. If the adjustment screw on the right is not enough to bring the doors into alignment, move to the left door and make adjustments using the leveling screw located on the bottom of the left fresh food door. If using both the left and right leveling screws is not enough, proceed to the leveling legs on the bottom of the freezer. Ensure all leveling legs are firmly touching the ground before proceeding. Then identify the door that is low and go to the leveling legs on that side of the refrigerator. When pliers, turn the leveling leg to raise the cabinet until the doors come into alignment. Check list. One, ensure the leveling legs are positioned solidly on the floor. Two, adjust the right door leveling screw. Three, if necessary, adjust the left door leveling screw. Four, if necessary, adjust the cabinet leveling legs. If you have questions, please call 1-800-GE-CARES. That's 1-800-432-2737.
