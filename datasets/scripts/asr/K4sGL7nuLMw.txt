 Hi everyone and welcome back. What are we doing this week? Well coming out of Christmas we all end up with bits of packaging and this and that so I thought right let's make some real cheap terrain so we're going to make a rock face or cliff style hill using some of our Christmas leftovers so let's get to the table. I'm self-a-cheap, he's a pack-and-pulled starry to come out with some box over Christmas and these craft knife, I've got the knife out nice length and I've got a size and gradually work our way around it taking off its slices to work into a hill shape but the knife do the work don't tear it otherwise you end up with bits going everywhere. Just taking off the top a little bit there and gradually just working around shaping it. So go keep a minute look which bits can take off, come off a little bit, get rid of any of the sharp and natural looking corners as you can. Take a bit more of the top to open it up, see if it gets stand on it, I think we're pretty well there. We're going to cut our base material so of Christmas over 10 time boxes, have a decent bit of MDF in it so I'll go to the scroll sort and I'll cut a base out. Alright we've got our base cut up, let's put it back in here, see if that'll be a piece of old starry. So I think we're going to put that back there, kind of at the back, a bit of wiggle around the front maybe. We've got some cork and we're going to get a bead of this around near the edge, they will squish down when you push it to cut it and start to come out. A little bit in the middle just a good measure of mentor at stake, got a good push down the base, right fingers, we're going to cover it. And work down the edges just to seal it all in, this has to get a protection to the film the edge so it helps transition between the base and the actual hill itself. Once on stand we just grab our finger and give it a good smooth to help blender, don't worry about being too perfect at the stage. Grab your grass and tin foil and put out a good size, get the job, give it a rep, then the first thing you do is fold it over and smooth it out, to get it double out and screw it up into a ball, not too tightly actually when put it apart, and gradually work it back out apart trying not to rip it. Once we've done that we're going to start making a tray, so just make sure you've got an idea of the width and folding the corners over obviously sort of be sort of watertight otherwise your plaster in the middle is going to pour everywhere, so try not to flatten out the bottom as you work around, don't worry if it's not laying flat on the table or it helps to the shape so we're pretty well there with the tray ready to go and it's the right size. Before we can add the plaster we're going to get some soapy water and just brush our mould, what this does it gives a moist layer to the bottom into the sides and when you pour in the plaster the moisture gets pulled up into the plaster, avoiding giving you air bubbles, the moisture gets in the air bubbles trapped against the side that you actually want to have as your rocks and it just doesn't look right, so this is a quick tip, if it's a hard mould you could just dip it in a bowl with soapy water. I've got some plaster reprised and I'll water and start mixing it up and pop, the more water than I've got a bit too far there, possibly slip it then, so just add a bit more plaster to get it back to where you want it, you're in from slightly thick plaster surface to normal probably, just pour it in, mix it up cover and scrape out your pot. It's ready to tell when it's dry, just give it a tap at the end of a brush, if it's so good where the brush disappears, if it's still damp you've got a hollow so it sounds like a dull sound and then you get a like normal sort of hitting a table type sound if when it's fully dried so if you should take the foil off you'll find the foil will catch into our bits, you just have to work the foil out and there you have it, I'll show you a rock face out and as you can see that's a man measurement, so you break it all down anyway so it doesn't matter it's always good to have some extra bits, just give it a rough layout of how you think it should go, just switch you got bits at fit and once that's done put it on the side and cover the whole face in and cool if you're a good coating when we add our pieces so brush your work them into the cool, then we've got squeeze, it will squeeze up in between them, some little bits around the bottom, just some of your little bits, we use the end of the brushing after they've worked, bits in, seal the gap at the top, just put the gap there so if I put it there you should finger the help blender if needs be, break up some small bits, just a little bit behind at the end which is a bit more court-miss, it all sticks down nicely and in tidy up all up with the cocktail stick afterwards it needs be, so there you have the main part done, so we're just going to take a couple of little bits to put them all the front, so just work them in with cork, again sticking down tidy up the cocktail stick and I think we're pretty well there with all the bits now so I saw a dry look at the roughserm, that black paint at Victor was a mod podge, like a coating all over our rock face and see that it has a deer as well which I sort of sealed up, so work away around the whole rock face, and get into all the crevices, so it's like a base grind, he actually did the MDF as well, that was to give it a coat so it doesn't absorb moisture, now we're going to add our texture paint all over it, so we've gradually worked around with our texture paint and cover up everywhere at the set for the front of the hill, so maybe we're just working it in, if it's a bit flat let it dry a bit and then just get a bit more of a stick or to bring it back up again to a bit more for a roughness afterwards, the texture paint is still wet, so we can get some chik-gret and just work it in, do the rock faces, just do a bit more texture, just work it in with a brush, what a touch I've pushed it in, I was actually quite surprised I thought I was going to seal these in arthas but to be honest they actually held really well, it's a bit refined out later but we're doing do a lot of seal coats on any way to give it a good deirance to go, so there you go, the stage is going to cross some burnt on back, the texture paint is dry, just to add a little bit of water, it's just to work our way around the edges, so it's a bit darker, I was actually feeling good at night, then we're on to our grey, it's a bit of our grey, then it down again, just to like a bit of brush, I'm just trying to cut some of the chippings a little bit here so I have to tip it to go and see, and then work our way along our cliff face, as well so we're just doing like an overbrush, cross-trends of dry brushing and painting, basically covering it, but not one about a bit showed, so I keep tipping it out of the larket, glad that it's shown the right, it is a bit of a thing, no, this can't be flat, that's going to have to be a grey or lighter colour, so just cover up, so it's literally working by eye here, just sort of going with the feel of the piece, just work our way around, I think we're pretty well there with that colour, just finished off the corner there, yeah that looks pretty good to me, so next we're going to look at adding more colours to it, so wanted to make sure you get over those bits, once you've got all the bits we're going to move on, so now we're going to brush some cream to some household emulsion, just dry brush away over the texture area, just a bit of a highlight, and then we've got some grey, reds in yellow, reds in red, since you see here I'm sort of mixing roughly mixing them, nothing over, thinned down quite a dark, and then just go to make up sponge and sponge the from, so this is literally just picking out various colours that go, not worrying about mixing them on the sponge even too much, just take it away from that pure grey, no rocky, pure grey, make sure you get the edges, and I think I'm fairly happy with that, I'd go with that, I would expect, yeah that looks pretty good to me, it's going to grab some of our grey and give it a dry brush, obviously without anything drying between the layers after they're just out to speed things up, so it would just work our way around, except sort of medium dry brushes, not particularly vibrant, it's not particularly heavy, which I'm avoiding brush marks, just picking up the details, as it goes, it just work around, when it's very happy with that, when you want to add a nice colour, which would be the cream, which is sort of a very light dusting, just pick up the very sort of tips, this would work around, take the tip and it's in serts, and literally it's just the points, I think we're pretty well done, that's done to look quite nice, started to pop, starting to get on the 3D texture, and the colouring as well as the actual form of a rock, so we're going to grab a black wash, it's null in oil, but it's actually got homemade wash, so there's some black paint then down, flow aid, and then we just work from our top surfaces, and let it run, and you can see as it runs, it highlights where the lines are, so you just put it about with a brush, which you go, so let it show you where the dark paste patches to be, and so I'm trying to guess, and here it just got some water, some flow aid, or just so just a little bit of our burnt paint, so it's a very thin wash, and we're just going to just coat it over the top, obviously this is after the other wash is dried, otherwise it would just all pull together, so just work around. Right, we're going to get some of our homemade flocks, I'll put a link to the video, so we have our fine green, some coarse green, because we have a loose gasser flock we made. We also have some darker flock, a little bit left, but I made up as well. Right, we got some water, we're just going to have some pp8 to solve the N, good mix, that'll be alright. So we get some pp8 on, I'm picking a little part over the overhang, I was just going to make sure I got the flock in there first, I'm working on the front, I'm actually even looking at the brown, I'm picking up the face with the gritties, so I don't need the dark least gasser towards the edge, just a little bit dark, so we'll be repeating this over, so you have the dark bits first, then just cover the whole thing afterwards with the light scatter, so we just speed it up as we work our way around, the main reason to get the section is just giving some wrong pretty fingers without sticking them in the flock, which I'll probably do anyway, so we'll just keep going and sure we'll get there, so I'll speed it up a little bit, obviously if you double sit there, watch me do this for a half an hour, or perhaps you do, so we need you there and I'll show you to when it's dry. And there we go, really that's dry, right, once it's dried up, we're just going to give it a bit of salt, that down with some water, a bit of soykin, and we're going to grab some very thin pva, a bit of dropper, it's better, we'll just drip it, so work from the top because it all runs down, so right there you have it, a very very cheap build, everything pretty much used from stuff on the shelf or bits we picked up over Christmas, which is basically a class of rubbish, so we've got MDF, cardboard style base, we have packing polystyrene, we use plaster of Paris, well that's fairly cheap to buy anyway, quite often kids get little casting kits and you end up with bits left, you don't need much to make rock faces, we used the aluminium striped in foil to make a mould, no Christmas we use the good stuff so it's a bit thicker, rust the year we use thin stuff, so if you're using the thin stuff just give it an extra fold, three layers thick, maybe four, you soon they'll really screw it up and open it up, all the craft paints, about a pound each, but obviously don't use a whole bottle, we use a little bit and they keep going, washes, made ourselves, so we just use a bit of paint, water and a setter, just thin it down, homemade flock, which we did a while back, so please go and check those videos out, if you want any more information you want me to go more in depth on any of the bits than this build, I can do that, I've had to condense it a little bit because there's quite a lot to get into this one, so just leave us a comment, I if you'd like this video please give it a thumbs up, please give it out there, share and please subscribe, don't forget to hit the bell, I'm sure we have a lot more exciting things coming up, we've got plenty more rubbish to get rid of and turning to something, right that's it from me this week, so take care and I'll see you all soon, cheers! i hope its on how it went to drink, got dirt, oh, i love this stuff hi everyone, and welcome back this week what we are going to do, we are going to look at making a Dr�gaint Cliff, LabITH A resident, high everyone. THANK YOU!
