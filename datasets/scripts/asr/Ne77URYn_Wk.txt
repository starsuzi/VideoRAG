 Hey there, it's Chef Katie. Thanks for joining me in the kitchen. Today, I have some beautiful red lentils. You see these? Beautiful. Sometimes, I'll also call them crimson lentils, but they're more look like orange lentils if you ask me, right? And what's funny is when you cook up these red lentils, they actually totally fade to like a dull yellow brownish color. So who knows, right? But lentils are a great source of healthy vegan, vegetarian protein, plant-based protein, great fiber. And they're the hallmark ingredient of DAW. Now DAW is basically just an Indian lentil dish, almost like a dip meets a stew, which is the sort of pulse or paste, very thick, very satisfying. I'll show you how easy it is to make a quick red lentil DAW. Oh, our DAW is done. And I cannot wait to dive into a bowl. This is just pure comfort, a little bit of spice, so many flavors going on. I'll talk with the red lentils, a little bit of seasoning from some garam masala, some fresh vegetables, carrot, onion, tomato, easy, delicious. Red lentils rule because plants rule. This is Chef Katie, I will see you next time.
