 The hood of this Porsche Cayenne has many fine scratches. When we wet the panel, we can see that most of the scratches disappear and are therefore clear coat scratches. The scratches that remain are paint scratches. Here's a technique for touching up these fine paint scratches without creating brush strokes. First, dab all the scratches with factory matched paint. The excess paint can be removed with a chemical we manufacture called scratch leveler. Apply a small amount to a cloth and gently wipe over the repair area. Scratch leveler removes the bad paint and the good paint stays neatly in the scratches. For best results, apply a small amount of our polish and buff away with a lint-free cloth. Here are the scratches before and here they are after. Get everything you've seen in this video at scratchwizard.net and make your car's fine paint scratches vanish, guaranteed.
