 Hey guys and welcome to today's video. With a random start so I thought I'd give you an intro and to what actually is. Today we set out to try and make a doctor pepper pizza. A story a while ago in a Mill Times channel when I was in meet being a love of the pepper, I had a doctor bake for my birthday for it. It's only right that at some point I go out and try and make this pizza. So the video starts off with us going to Stainsbury's and try and buy the ingredients and it carries on from there. No more these means to talk anymore so I won't but let's get into the video. Why do I do these guys man? Why? Why? That's so disgusting man. That's oh my god. You know it's good. It doesn't mean it's good. That's so good. It's really healthy right now. It's fine. Don't worry. Why did you block the fire? That's fine. That was sick too. We've done all the hard parts but these parts I don't know. We've got our puree here. We have our pepperoni coated up over here. Now we need to make the base for the pizza. Oh god. I don't want them anymore. I'm not touched it. Where is that? This is the pizza base because the two ladies need to actually go out and get we have to act your flower. Oh wow. You know. I've got add water still. So what is already made? It just means the pizza is going to rise properly. That's the lazy version. Stop complaining. All right. Great measure in there. I mean, it's not even eating the dyes man. Just pop that for a little bit. That's mad. I probably just added Dr. Pepper in there. Man. I don't even want to know. It's coming in. I don't think you want to look inside too. It looks like dry tuna. Tell me that doesn't look like sankovacuna. Oh yeah. It's over. Don't come. Give me odds on you trying that right now. A little over. Oh come on. I have a fucking dogbist yet earlier. Later just because I had a lot of hot. A good man would do three. I'm not a good man. Okay. A great man would do two. Three, two, one, two. He was a little late. No, I'm a little late. We'll try to get all done. No, okay. A little late. Good. Three. I know. Three, two, one, two. Bro, I can just hold him down. Oh, I can't do it. You're a worse going over. I'll pay on a temporary end. What do you want? Why? Oh, ground. There's something over there though. No. No. It's supposed to form a smooth dough. But a smooth dough look like. Not that. I beg you just try some of it. Yeah, come on. Yeah, I mean, just putting his mouth in and put it back in there. No, I didn't. I'm going to laugh and get in kind of bored now. Same. So when do you do the flip, flip it. That's all I'm here for. When do we get to the good part? Every chef watching this is rolling in that grade. You know what you should do after this. You should tweet this to Golden Manzi. So she remembers you already. That's his name. Oh, you're okay. Are you? Why? You put so much in though. It just stops my hand. So we do you have a thing as I can cook. So this is just making it upset. Yeah, just give it like some good like wrist action. This is going to all three wrong. I don't think we can get a pizza out of this. Just keep kneading it and we'll start getting harder and harder and harder. I'm going to a burst. Are you still doing the frying part? Yes. That only reason I'm here. What about the cheese? No cheese. What do you mean? No. Why? Yeah, what do you mean? No. There's a few cheese on the pizza, but they won't have to have fried it. How would you have Dr. Pepper in the dough? No, you can't put that to pepper in the dough. No, I was normal. Try to pepper in the cheese. Oh, no, that's not actually cute. All right, watch him eat this and be like the greatest thing of all my kind. And this can be his new meal. Pretty much, yeah. We're all going to throw up. Right. So he's rolling pin time. Jinger, don't you think that that needs to be thrown? Oh, no. Anything. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think that looks like it needs to be thrown, Josh. I think it does need to be thrown. Josh? Spin it. I mean, throw it. Oh, you throw it, do you? Throw it, do you? Throw it, do you? Throw it until you caught it. The spins are okay, actually. The throw is good. It's just when you try and catch it like this. Yeah, well, I don't know how to have pizzas. I'm just trying to have a heart attack. Josh, is there any way you're left out? This is easy. You do this and you die. That's what happens. Your heart goes. Oh, fuck it, boy. This is great. Straight down, mate. Oh, shit. It was a winged shape. No, actually, it's a very good chain. Okay. So pepperoni is still marinating in here. It's thrown, all right. It just looks a bit funky. And these are gone very funky. Very funky. Very loud in here. It's a good working environment. And over here. It's smelling sweet. Not tomorrow, are we sweet? I don't know how it's going to go. I just don't know. I already made a piece of it. Tastes like tomorrow. Josh, what have you done? Do you have to watch those? No, Josh. No. We need more. Your more sauce. Don't want more sauce. Josh, you can just do pepper. Too much sauce. Yeah. Josh, you can do that. Pizza. Hey. Too much sauce. Hey. I can't even open the packet. Oh, jeez. The very best sauce. Nice, fine. And set it as the mozzarella. Too much cheese. How much cheese is in the pan? How much cheese do you want on it? Well, there's no Josh pepperoni. I hate it. I don't want much. Can you make this after the fight? You said it. You wouldn't. I don't want to eat it now. I would want it to be the sauce. But how much cheese is in? It is kind of weirdly appetizing. But you're going to go with erotic. But what? I don't know. It's been a while. Look at that. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Oh, don't need to drink everywhere. But this is the most weirdest thing ever. Drugs are really out of you now. You just let the juice is dripping too. Yeah, I want the juice. I've got it. I'm good. I mean. Oh yeah, yes. We're working to that little business. We don't want to do that. That's the vegetarian part. Vegetarian. So we cover both angles. Oh yeah, that's. This is my part. Yes. I hope. I really hope this is grim as fuck. Yeah. No, no, no, no. What is? I need to take a small bite and go. So I've been in the state. Why? What? I've got to be there. I go to the net for like 15 minutes. Are you looking too bad? You're not trying out. No, no, no. That was not. What did we do? What? What? What did I do in a previous lab? To have to do this. It smells sweet. Because there's like 9,000 grams of dog. That's not. 9,000 grams. Yeah. You're not sugar eating. Is he too? Why don't you want to sit down here? You're not going to try it. Are you? Yeah. I was sent by Joe, though, to try and make you eat it. You look scared. I am a little scared. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Rock pebbles. OK. One, two, three, show. Come on. One, two, three, show. One, two, three, show. One, two, three, show. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A fun. Is your idea, too, that? What? What's the Rock pebbles? You can have like a bag. 100%. He likes it decently, surely. No, he likes it. He just tastes like shit pizza. I mean, as I take a bite, it kind of smells like ass. It smells like ass. What? It smells like ass, I don't think. It smells like ass. Who's ass? He smells. Both an ass. Both an ass. I don't even say ass. No, wait, you think it's hot or taste bad? What? OK. So I was going to say, me and Shredder made pizzas with him. And his was gross. But he said I also gross. I mean, Shredder both the way they went. You check out my channel. Well, see some in there. Look at it. Come on, the suspense is killing me. I want to know the pizzas in there. No, I just tasted a bit of fizz. What are you doing? Well, you've got sick crusts. Look at my shit. Oh, it's pretty mouth. What did she say? What? She said. We all. You want to try some pizza? I had Dr. Bathroom. No, no, no, no, no, no. Just don't. You're not going to be. You're not going to be. What makes it not to try the pizza? What do you mean what makes it? I'm marinated. I'm marinated to have grownese dots pepper. The pure rate of maybe dots pepper. The dough knows dots pepper. Have you not watched the video? God. This is my dinner. So it has to be good. Look, you can see that brown retagency is at the pepper. That's still wet. I mean, if I got it, the feature expressed, I'd probably be like, I won't go there again. What? What as a home cook pizza by you? Mm-hmm. Jason. You're missing the key ingredient. You live atariums. I'd think Dr. Pepper is the key ingredient. Yeah. I need salt to pepperoni in it. Yeah, but you also put it in here. This is extra flavor in the Santa Fe, like, two hours. I'll try a slice. Yeah! I'm not wearing it, you know. You think it's like... Right. The nut is really got the pepper in. Yeah, I mean it. You put half a slice. No, it's quite like a... It's a marbling. It's nice though, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. There you go. Oh, I can't believe it. I really can't believe it. You two two three, I'm so excited. Go ahead and open it. Open it. Open it. Hopefully, that's how it goes. Safety, don't worry. It's fine and touch it. Let's take it off. Please like it. What are you chewing? You didn't buy any? There's no difference. It's how it's happening. What? What? What do you say? What's it saying? Anyone know? What? No, I've heard that before. Wait, let it go. Go. Try to fix something. Take it. Um, we got a bum. A bloody bum. Right, right. Just the right. Would you buy it? It's not all right, is it? Well, it's a why are you the only one that's gas, still? You mean, can you make your own food? It tastes nice, right? Oh, yeah, too. It's what enthers me into this shit. Not literally. Not literally. You know what I like to. Because there's cheese. Any more cheese outside? No, no. Now the cheese is off, right? Cheese. Yeah, it's fizzy. What does that face mean? Cheese. I don't want that face means. What about cheese? That's why I'm holding it in this part. Try to bite our ass. Something. No, no, no, no. Man! What the hell? That's my sweet. I get so mad. The real challenge. I've been holding it in this one, I'm natural. That was a little bit of tomato. Yeah, fuck it. God, you just lick it. No, no, no. That's my guess. What? Can I have a look? Show me where to send him to. Pick a lick so he just... Just... No. That is different from being knocked out, I'm not. Oh, just... Can't speak about the pepperoni. The dough is good. The cheese is good. Fucking sauce. The sauce is not. I told you there was too much sauce. Too much sauce. I didn't tell him to. That's what sauce? No, no, no. No. We need more. Your mouth is... Hey. No, my mouth is... Don't touch it. I didn't use your trot. I didn't use it there, I'd say no. Can't use your trot. Man, the cheese is good. I'm not really anything that wasn't in it. Does it smell like us? I meant to dash it there. Dash it somewhere else, man. It's my dinner. I mean, for that's... You're right. I'm trying to feel like I wasted all this fun filming this now.
