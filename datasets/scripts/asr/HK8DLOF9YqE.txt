 618, everyone. Welcome back. I'm newstens Christina Ranjillo time to check in with Steve Caparizo for this week's pet connection extra. Thank you, Christina. We're all familiar with the common nose bleed. For most of us, it's no big deal, but did you know what can happen to our pets as well? The important thing to remember is don't panic. Have a plan of attack to slow the bleeding and most importantly, make your pet feel at ease. The very first thing is to do what Daisy's doing right now. To provide to become so you quietly pet them, try to get them to relax. You know, our pets are so good at queuing in on what we're thinking and feeling and of course it's scary for us to see a nose, to see blood coming from our dogs nose and we get anxious. They pick it up instantly and go, oh my gosh. That's anxious. I better be anxious and of course their blood pressure goes up and they bleed more. The first thing to do is to slow the bleeding. Put some ice on it. You know, take an ice pack right across the bridge of the nose and just put it on the side. If it's on one side, if it's on both sides, you can put it across the top and wrap it. Or if you have these these hard ones, just wrap these and something soft and you can use a hard one. Again, just hold it against the nose on the side that's bleeding. What can be the cause of a nose bleed? We break it down into things that physically can cause it. They ran into a tree outside or they were playing rough with their friend and any kind of trauma to foreign objects. Grass awl can be in their nose and we see those every every season to a polyp or a tumor to illnesses that cause bleeding or hemorrhage. Thanks, Dr. Ed. Now there are times when the bleeding may be more severe and you can't stop it. This is the time to get to your veterinarian to see what is really going on. Back to you, Christina. Thank you.
