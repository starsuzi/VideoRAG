 Hi there, we're looking at my two-seater lounge or two-seater sofa and this seat here is in front of us is the seat that I sit on the most to watch TV and it's just down to SAG. That seat so I'm just going to show you what I've done to help eliminate that SAG. So there we go I've added a piece of three ply wood to the base here and it goes right to the back and it's cut at level there at the front. It's still got a bit of a flex in the middle so it's not too hard to sit on. So there we go that's what I've done to help eliminate the SAG in my lounge.
