 Right, now we're going to put a saddle together. Here is a saddle, the girth, the two stirrups and the stirruppleathers. Take one of the stirruppleathers. This is the right side of the stirrupp pleather, the turnie to offer. Okay, so this is the wrong side of the stirrupp pleather. Take the tip, pass the tip through the stirrupp, take the tip through to here. Now there's two ways you can put it on. You can either feed the tip through like that or some saddles are a bit stiff and it's easier to put it on like that. Okay, so choose whichever way is easier. Pull the stirruppleathers through, pass it in the buckle. Okay, and then pull down this strap so that the buckle goes to the top. This part of the saddle is called the skirt and that prevents the buckle from rubbing your leg. Now we're going to put the stirrupp up by sliding the stirrupp up the back of the leathers and then putting all the leathers through the stirrupple like so. Okay, we're going to do the same with the other stirrupp. So there's the correct side of the buckle, turn it over, follow it through to the tip, pass the tip through the stirrupp. Through the stirrupp bar here, the stirrupp bar is down, you can see there. So that if you fall off, the stirruppleather should just pull away from the stirrupp and you shouldn't get dragged, pull down, buckle at the top, stirrupp to the bottom of the stirruppleather and then all the way at the back strap pass the straps through the stirruppleather like that. Now what you're going to do, take the girth, come to this side of the saddle, lift up the saddle flap, lift up the buckle guide if you've got one, then fasten the buckles on the first strap and the last strap. Here, the middle strap there is for either adjustment or a spare case one breaks. On the crafty pornois saddle you've just got the two straps. So fasten the girth and then lift the girth off with the saddle and there is your put together saddle ready to go on your horse.
