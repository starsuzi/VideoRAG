start we're not talking so normally what I do guys I don't use washing powder I use that for my washing machine and normally I use fairy I you guys will be wondering why am I using fairy because fairy is good most of us we use fairy to wash our plates and it doesn't damage our hands so I like using fairy for my clothes and normally clean it you know and is it once a while I wash my clothes with my hands or any clothes I know that I cannot be washing the washing machine most of other clothes I wash it in the washing machine so first thing I'm doing I'm gonna pour my water here until I let you guys know this one time here is one I have to plug two ketu you know I have to pour two boiled water from ketu inside this water because it's really really cold so I'm just going my fairy and if you have any hand wash powder you can use you don't have to use fairy you guys might find me strange I'm strange why am I using fairy to wash my clothes but I like it that so what I'm going to do I'm soaking the clothes first this is my son clothes my children's school uniform you know I'm just soaking everything first my son are pajamas you guys gonna see I'm going to soak everything guys I think the water is not enough so I'm going to add the remaining water I'm going to pour the soap on top I'm going to add the rest of the clothes so this is it so after finished soaking my clothes I'm going to leave it for 15 minutes or you can leave it longer but I'm going to leave it for 15 minutes then I'll come back then we'll start you know scrubbing and start washing I mean while I go and get another water already I'll pour another water in the bowl in the pocket here so that when I wash it from here I'll be pushing it inside the water here okay guys so guys I'm back now this is 15 minutes later and I'm going to start scrubbing so let's start can you guys see me properly you guys wait let me zoom the camera right so that you can't get a see me properly where I'm scrubbing that's better so now I'm going to start most of you that wash watch easy wash clothes out to wash my clothes I'm making video for the viewers sorry guys you guys this is very familiar now I normally wash this and last time I was being lazy I didn't wash it with my hands I don't fit in the washing machine and then the color is coming off already you guys can see so this like this always better to wash it with your hands and it's fun you know it's fun to wash it with your hands isn't it Salah yeah no don't pull Bobo our mommy so when you're washing your clothes the first thing you want to scrub is the the front and then the neck and then the armpit you know and I think it's better when you wash your clothes with your hands because you get to scrub every bit you know sometimes when my children will go go making video sometimes when my children close is when I wash it with washing machine sometimes this thing is still there but when I use my hand to wash it at least I scrub the particular place that has the state and you normally come off you know so enough talking now let me start scrubbing are you guys can you hear the sound I don't know I can't stop talking you guys can you hear the sound I just love the sound so much I'm just talking that what is you've been sending me coming that you love the sound you know you just like you remind your back home yeah especially when you're washing it in your garden like this warm up would you ask for maybe tickets to go on the city your parents guys I'm one thing I also like when I wash and close with your hands I always mention it in all my videos when I'm washing clothes you can get to wash black red green any color like this my son's a no three jumper this is my daughter a wine jumper you know I wash everything in the same in the same bowl you know but if it's washing machine you wouldn't try that because the color that will come up after washing it you wouldn't like it you see and it's nice I'm forming guys I like it this is my own way of cleaning bubbles you I know you don't like bubbles this is my own ways so just scrub and scrub scrub scrub the armpits around the neck and then you open the neck and let the water go through like that and then you squeeze it like that and tip the next one thank you guys see now this is red if I'm washing this with let's say I'm washing this lotion washing machine I'll be scared to add this red because I want it to damage clothes like this you know I believe I also have whites in here you know so this is to prove to you my subscribers that whatever you subscribe to my channel it
