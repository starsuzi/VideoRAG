 If there are no lights on the display, check to make sure the power cord is still plugged into the grounded 3-prong outlet. If plugged in, a simple way to check the outlet is to use a known working lamp or hairdryer to check to see if the outlet is operating. If the outlet is on a GFCI outlet or shared circuit, check to see if the outlet needs to be reset. Next, check to see if the fuse is blown or circuit breaker thrown in the household circuit panel. If the outlet is the problem, call an electrician. Was an extension cord being used? If an extension cord was used, there will be less voltage supplied to the washer. This will cause the motor to run hot and shut down prematurely. Discontinue using the extension cord. If power is supplied to the machine, check to make sure that the cold water is turned on and operational. Restart the washer with cold water selected. If no cold water comes in, check for kinked water line or clogged hose inlet screens. If this does not solve the problem, go to troubleshooting for won't drain or spin.
