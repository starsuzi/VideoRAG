 What's good guys to pair him here with an easy do it yourself video showing you how to clean your headlights or your tail lights on your car using some household items. So some things that you will need and it's very easy. All you're going to need is toothpaste and if you do have whitening toothpaste it does work best. You will also need a rag or two. It doesn't matter. I'm just using t-shirts and last but not least you will need water. If you want you can even bring your iPod or phone or something because everything is better with music. But let's get on into it now. It's very simple to do. All you're going to do is first water it down the headlight that you are going to clean and then put on some toothpaste on it from there. And now you're just going to scrub it in for about two, three minutes, you know, especially at the top or wherever it is yellow for you. You're going to want to scrub there pretty well and then let it sit for about a minute or so and then you're good to go for the clean. This is also just as easy to do. Just try not to get too much of the toothpaste on your paint just because it is a bit of a pain to clean off from there. But just water it down, get it nice and clean and you should have a really good look in the headlight. Here's a before and after photo that I've taken and as you can tell it really took away kind of that ugly yellow tint that has occurred on the top half of my headlight and it's very easy to do and I'm sure you have these household products. So if you like this video give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends and I'll catch you guys in the next one. Peace.
