 Hi everyone, my name is Lila and welcome to my kitchen. I've had a lot of questions lately asking me how to cut my cucumbers and carrots into those thin little match stick strips. And that cut is actually called the Julien cut. So today I'm just going to show you how easy it is to julienne a cucumber. Here's my cucumber that I've rinsed under cold running water and dried. I'm just going to chop off the ends and then cut it into about 1.5 to 2 inch lengths. Then I'm going to cut each length long ways into thin strips. Now I'm going to stack these strips and just cut them into thin slices like this. Then we have our julienned cucumber. Now this is with the seeds. I'm going to show you also how to do it without the seeds. There are actually two ways to do this without the seeds. First, take your stack and slice the outside portion and discard the center seeds. The other way is to roll cut around the center of the seeds like this. And then just slice this outside portion into your thin strips. And there you have your julienned carrot. Thank you for watching.
