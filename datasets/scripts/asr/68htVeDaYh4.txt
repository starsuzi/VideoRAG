 We'd love to find a springform pan that doesn't let moisture seep in when you place it in a water bath. Our preferred method for baking delicate desserts like cheesecake. But we've learned from testing springform pans that for now, that pan is still a pipe dream. Our solution has always been to wrap the pan with a double layer of aluminum foil and tightly crimp it around the pan's edge. And while this technique helps, it's not a perfect fix because steam from the water bath condenses inside the foil. Recently we came up with an even better way to address the problem. Placing the springform pan inside a slightly larger metal pan or pot, like a 10 inch cake pan, before lowering both of them into the water bath. The slight gap between the pans isn't wide enough to prevent the water from insulating the springform pan and there's zero danger of exposing the cheesecake to water because any moisture that collects on the sides of the pans rapidly evaporates. If you bake cheesecake regularly, this method is more than worth the minimal expense of buying a large metal cake pan.
