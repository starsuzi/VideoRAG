 Kitty's Eezer! Okay, Asme, I'm going to pop home to get Olivia's present. Can you bring the cake straight to the party? Absolutely! You can count on me, Lleana! I won't eat it. I promise. Okay, I trust you. You've got the survey act as well, right? Yep! Great! See you soon! It's fine. I need a one-tail of this super yummy, delicious cake. Well, I suppose no one there if I try a time. What do I think? This isn't good! Lleana's going to be mad! Unless... Perfect! No, ever know! Oh, be bad to waste it. Mmm, that looks good cake. Oh? Hey, Asme! Have you left the party yet? Nope, just about to. You haven't eaten the cake, have you? Ha! Of course not. Anyway, gotta go. Bye! Oh, what am I going to do? Mmmhmm. Asme and the cake will be here any moment, Olivia. Oh, how excited! Happy birthday, Olivia! Thanks, Asme! Have you got the cake, Asme? Yeah. Well, let's see it then. Oh, thanks, Asme! That's not the cake we had earlier, Asme. Yeah, it is. It just got a little... A squished on the way here. Asme! Here's a paper towel, it's covered in icing, not a cake. Really? I should get back to the shopping plane right away. Asme, asme, wait, it's fine. I bought a spare cake. A spare? Yeah, this happens every year asme. Oh yes, Malistona on the way. Uh, it's a style thing. Oh, cake! I thought you said Rake! Do you want some, Asme? Or are you full already? I think I could probably finish a small slice. It's amazing. It's so cool. It's a fish. Girls, it's just a fish. Do you think it gets tied? I'll get to try the bikes one more time. Oh, bad. Yeah, it hasn't even come up for air. It doesn't have to come up for air. I wish I could breathe under water. I wish I was a fish. Well, I'm perfectly happy being a human. Guys, can we do something other than start the fish? See you guys later. Beautiful! I wish I was a fish. I wish I was a fish. You should brag then. Is that a voice in my head? Yes. Then why does it sound like... Malist. Got you. Malist. You liked my idea though, didn't you? I didn't pretend you didn't. I go on, go back in there and turn them into fish. You know you want to. I couldn't. You could. Well, I suppose I could. It would be funny, right? Very funny. You won't tell anybody it was me. Me? Turn only one. No. In which case? Huh? Isabella? Did you do this? Yes. Isabella? Why did you do this? I... Yeah, it's a Bella. This is... Well, I... This is... Well, I... This is amazing. Yes. Thanks, Isabella. Yes. Well, you know, it's nice to be... I know. That was close. It was, wasn't it? Madness. You said you wouldn't tell anyone. Did I? Oops, my mistake. I never should've trusted you, Madness. Too right. Ah! Yeah! Yeah! I'm not a fish with so funny. What's that? Oh, it stinks. Is that Isabella? It is Isabella. Thanks, girls. What happened is the Bella? Yeah! Who did this to you? Oh, why? Huh, there's no getting to any of that. It's over now. Okay, I just have to cut the black wire without cutting the red one. And my creation should be ready. Hey, you know what you're doing! Ooh, your building is something for the talent contest. Yep, it's the smoke machine. I bet it's smoke machine. What makes you say that, Esme? Well, it's smoking a lot now. It's a smoke machine. Well, I can't tell you. It's a surprise for the talent contest tonight. What's your talent, Esme? Well, I can't decide between holding a hand stud for 10 minutes or eating ten whole tops of harvests in 10 seconds. Is either actually possible? Da! Well, what are the others doing? Well, Olivia and Isabella are doing some kind of joint talent. They're planning some kind of that side thing. I'm just going to show you a little bit of what's going on. I'm going to show you a little bit of what's going on. I'm going to show you a little bit of what's going on. Olivia, Olivia, this isn't working. Isabella, we're redefining dance, the fusion of ballet and umpa. Belumpa. Yes, I know what you said. It's going to be the next ballet or umpa. Or bigger than both combined. Exactly, now come on. 5, 6, 7, 8. What about Alice? Is she entering the competition? Yeah, she said she's got a talent. We won't see coming. Let's hope it's better than last year. Yeah, paintings are always a lot more impressive when you don't use invisible paints. Yeah, I wonder what she is doing this year. Hi. It's no good, Timothy. If they didn't like my invisible painting, they'll never like my book written in invisible ink. Oh, Timothy, what am I going to do? Timothy, you're right. I can show you my st- Timothy, Timothy, where are you? If this can work on spiders, then it can work on me. Oh, it would help if you could see me, would it fit? So now you can see me, but the princesses won't have a clue. Time to be covered at this talent show. It won't stop smoking. Okay, it's a smoke machine. I'm telling you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the Kitty Zozer Talent Show. We have a very exciting evening plan. Follow wonderful talents. First up, we'll have Esme, who's going to be impressing us with her eating skills. Thanks, everyone. Now, we're eating 10 whole tops of hamburger in 10 seconds. Three, two, one, go! And your 10 seconds are up. Let's count the tops. One, two, three, eight, nine. And there's no tenth box. Hard luck Esme, hard luck. Next up are Olivia and Isabella, who will be doing some balloon par. It's a balloon par. Hit the music. And there's a balloon par. And there's a balloon par. And there's a balloon par. And there's a balloon par. And there's a balloon par. And there's a balloon par. And there's a balloon par. And there's a balloon par. And there's a balloon par. And there's a balloon par. Hang on, what's that? There's someone in the snow. What? Where? Hello? Quick, throw the pie that's it. And Lilliana, your last. What is your invention? Can't you tell it's a smart machine? New it. Well, that concludes the evening. Alice never turned up to compete. I wonder where she is. So this machine can really turn things giant. Yep, just point the Reagan at whatever you want to turn giant. Press the button and boom, giant. Let's see what's going on today. What, that's the dark circle again. So this machine can really turn things giant. Yep, just point the Reagan at whatever you want to turn giant. Press the button and boom. Giant. Oh, this is just waiting for my moisture. I think I've got the perfect thing to test it on. I couldn't think of anything better. Do you want to do the honours, Esme? I'd love to. So I press this button. And then we'll put this. You don't need to stop the machine because this is what it is. Three, two, one. Lilliana, where are you? Lilliana, Lilliana. Lilliana, Lilliana, are you hiking? Wow, this is weird. So Lilliana's tiny. Lilliana. Oh, Lilliana, I'm so sorry. Esme, put me down. I'm getting a little altitude sickness here. Wow, it's been fun and all Esme. But I think it's time to get me back to my normal size. There's a control panel on the back of the machine. Got it. Okay, change it to turn normal and I should be fine in no time. Well, that work if the wise that cannot be broken or broken. Of course not. Wait, they haven't actually been broken, have they? Right, Esme, there's only one thing for it. You're going to have to fix the machine. Okay, first things first. Okay, that's almost everything. But it won't work if we can't find a replacement wire. Which we don't have. Unless. Esme, if you have military circuit wires in there, I'll eat my hat. I don't, but I do have the next best thing. Oh yeah, what's that? Straw releases. Well, we've got nothing else. So let's give it to go. Ready, Lilliana. Ready. Three, two, one. Huh. What a good morning. Morning. Timothy for a nice long walk. Didn't I, Timothy? Clean my room. And it's still only the morning, which means plenty of time for my favourite pastime. Princess Pranking. And I'm asking you, planning a pamper day. And I'm asking, under cabbage, pamper day plus cabbage, a snack, rice cabbage, a goods, exfoliator, or a moisturizer, and all. And all! What are they doing in there? I've got to get a clotheslant. Oh, well if I could see what's around, I might be able to hear what they're up to. What are they doing in there? I have to know what they're doing. I have to know what's going on in there. It's driving me crazy. There's got to be something more steady around here to stand on. This wasn't here before. I swear. I just don't understand. And I'm asked a cabbage and an all. And I'm asked a cabbage and an all. Where is she off to? What's going on here? What's going on here? What's going on here? What's going on here? Oh my goodness. Nothing. What's going on here?
