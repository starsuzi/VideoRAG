 Hi guys, so I have this concoction here I wanted to share a little bit with you about and I also wanted to talk a little bit about probiotics and fermented products and I am not an expert on probiotics and or fermented products but I have become more of a fan of certain types of foods that are natural probiotics versus taking a bunch of additional probiotics. I do get a source of probiotics in my shake every morning so I don't feel that I need a lot of additional but it doesn't hurt to get a little extra and I do think it's helped with my skin and just my vet health overall so I wanted to give you some suggestions in ways you can get natural probiotics into your diet on a regular basis and some of these options are dairy and some are non-dairy because I used to feel like I was a little bit more lactose intolerant but I don't know that I am but I'm still a little leery body eating too much dairy but I do eat yogurt almost every day and that is a great source of probiotics and those light cultures that you get in yogurt so I have been going through a lot of this round-how week yogurt that I found at Whole Foods here but I think the biggest thing with yogurt for me anyway because it is dairy and I do you know I'm cautious of dairy is that I want to make sure that it's organic and that's just my personal preference but another thing that I'd like to check for is the amount of sugar and if it's a good source of protein because I eat my yogurt as a source of protein as well and if it doesn't have a lot of protein and it's got a lot of extra sugar then it's really not doing me any good so I feel like it's more important to have the higher protein lower sugar. I get my plane I add either maybe a little bit of vanilla extract or just maybe even a little bit of honey you can add a little bit of granola if it's a good you know not a high sugar granola you can add fresh fruit and you can add any number of different things. I even like to crumble up kind of sometimes and throw that in there because some of those have a decent amount of you know you get the nuts and the for the good fat and then you've got some a little bit of sugar but not much it's just mostly from the cocoa. So yogurt but it is a dairy product so if it's something if you're not a dairy fan that might not be something that you would like to you know eat on a regular basis but you know occasionally I I don't think if you don't have a dairy issue I don't think that it's a problem to eat yogurt. I've also started on the weekends enjoying some frozen yogurt and again I do go for the organic a good brand that I trust and these still have the probiotic benefits in them so I feel like I'm getting you a snack and a treat with also the benefit of the probiotics and those cultures that you get in yogurt. Another great source of protein probiotics and you know just the benefits of those products is cutted cheese again it's dairy but it's a great source of protein this particular one has 14 grams of protein in a serving a serving is a half of a cup and it's only got four grams of sugar so cutted cheese is a great option for adding a little bit of additional protein and those probiotic benefits to your diet so but if you're looking for non-dairy items I know that was all dairy so the next couple items I wanted to share with you and when they've been doing and people make their own I haven't mentored that way but kombucha and I might be saying it wrong. It's a fermented probiotic drink and it's a great again source of probiotics you can get them with very minimal sugar in the process there is a natural sugar product you know in the process of making it so there's going to be some sugar in it but it's a very non-alarm on a sugar so I don't even drink a whole bottle I think about a third of it so these are a great option you can get these pretty much at the new local grocery store now I actually found a case of this I think was a case of six or eight at samsuk up here so again another great way to get your probiotics in through something as simple as that and fermented you know usually there's a process to getting that active culture kind of part out of foods and so I also found these pickled beets in the process of pickling them they have been fermented therefore now they're having they have those probiotic benefits so it has live cultures in this and so I love beets this is a great way for me to have beets and I have to go through the process plus get the benefit of the fermenting food for the probiotic aspect of it too. Thank you guys so much for jumping on I'm just kind of talking a little bit about fermented foods and probiotics and I my disclaimers I am not an expert I just know that for me having the addition of some natural probiotics in addition to what I get in my regular dose of my shake I feel so much better my stomach issues have been nominal and my I think my skin has been benefited from the addition of the probiotics that I get through natural products and I have not felt the need to add any additional probiotics to my regimen so what I wanted to share with you was this recipe that I discovered somebody shared and I went ahead and made up my own version of it again I like to kind of make my own version of things because I kind of based off of what I have and what my taste preferences are but I made the beat pronouncing it wrong I had never heard of this before but it's called swichle or swichle I think it's called swichle and it's a drink apparently they had back in the heyday as what they called it and it is a refreshing drink that they used to enjoy and it was a naturally fermented drink that they would enjoy on a summer summer day to kind of be refreshing and you know kind of give them that kick from the apple cider vinegar that is in there so apple cider vinegar is another great staple I have in my house for the benefits that it offers you just want to make sure that it is unfiltered and unpasteurized this one I actually found it Costco but you can get the brags which is a brand that I really like pretty much anywhere as well but you just want to make sure that it has the mother in it is that's what they call it and so this compaction I have in a mason jar and I'm actually letting it sit overnight fermenting and it's already fermented it's already got the probiotic benefits because this is already gone through the process but it's just at the to the next level so in my mason jar the recipe called for a quarter cup of the apple cider vinegar I actually double that because I really do like the taste of the apple cider vinegar and I can always dilute it throughout the day if I decide it's a little bit too strong so a quarter cup of the apple cider vinegar two to three tablespoons of pure honey so I put my honey in there and then I think it was a tablespoon of honey or sorry lemon so that again going to be to your taste preference but you know you can't go wrong with lemon lemon is a great addition to anything you can't find the equivalent or the the amount of lemon but anyway I think it was about a tablespoon or teaspoon of lemon juice fresh weas I actually kept the lemon peel and whole lemon piece in here the wedge that I use so I'm just going to kind of get a little bit more of the lemon cider and then it's a teaspoon of fresh created ginger which another huge huge staple to have in your house I can't say enough about ginger it's a great natural anti-inflammatory it has so many other benefits to it that you know if it's something that you don't have on your daily regimen I highly recommend it again I put this in my shakes in the morning I just put a little piece I break it off and peel it and put it into my shakes so I blended in and add a little bit of kick not too much flavor and it's just that added benefit so in this I grated a chapterly finally grated my ginger and put it in here and so then the rest of you know I had about that much of that liquid and then I added the rest blotter and then I just have shaken it a few times but basically you can drink it as is once you strain the ginger pieces but again I want to let it sit so the absorbs all those flavors it gets that full benefit of the fermenting so I will do that tomorrow but you can strain the ginger and get that going serve chilled and it's a you know I'm looking forward to it I think it's going to be a kind of a refreshing summer drink idea so hopefully those tips for helpful and those of you that are still on thank you so much for listening to me share a little bit about these natural probiotics and you know how fermented foods could be such a benefit to you to your gut health and to your you know your life in general when you suffer from stomach issues as I as I have had to deal with in the past it's nice to have some away from that so how much do you drink a day you know I haven't made this particular type of apple cider vinegar drink yet but I have every morning I take a shot glass half apple cider vinegar half of water and then I kind of put a little bit of honey in that and I drink that in the morning and at night before I go to bed I have made up you know something similar to this size with a similar ratio of those ingredients and then I might again have some in the morning and some in the evening some people like to make up a picture of something like this maybe a little bit more diluted and they can sit on it throughout the day I think it's really kind of up to you the other thing I forgot to mention super quick guys when I made this up because this is how I like to make my apple cider vinegar vinegar vinegar drinks is I added a little bit of cinnamon and cayenne pepper I like the taste of those two together and I love that with the apple cider vinegar I just again there's more benefits to the cinnamon and cayenne pepper that people maybe don't realize so doesn't hurt to add that to your foods as well so I did add that to their but hopefully that answers your question Cheryl I just it's kind of up to you this I probably would have in a couple days because I think after you've made it and opened it up you probably don't want to leave it or leave it open and not consume it within a few days but you know you can always dilute it and sit on it throughout the day so hopefully that made sense thanks again guys so much for listening and like I said I hope it's helpful so you have any questions I will actually share the link to where I got this recipe in the comments or in the the post somewhere so that you guys can reference it because there's some other additional notes on the benefits of the ingredients that are in this this switchal drink so take care guys I know it looks like moonshine and actually when I made it um earlier I was thinking gosh I wonder people would think that that's what I'm making but no it's called special all right take care guys thanks
