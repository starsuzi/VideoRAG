 It's a hot August afternoon and I'm called out to a customer's house here in Southern Connecticut. The report is of these big bees swarming around this Elm tree in New York and I come out here and to my amazement I see literally hundreds of cicada killers from the bottom of the tree all the way up maybe 40 feet off the ground all the way around the tree and they're apparently here to lap up something that's oozing out of the tree I suppose it's some kind of syrup or some kind of a booze that they just find irresistible. They're also very competitive with each other as well as the other species of wasps that are on the tree. There's there were some yellow jackets here, ball-faced hornets, bumblebees, honeybees. They were all here to share in the nectar if you will from the tree. The cicada killers were definitely dominant here they pushed any other wasps out of their way at will because they are up to two inches long and they dwarf most other species. Here you can actually see them fighting over this little honey hole in a little yellow jacket trying to get in on the action but not successful at all. Here's a ball-faced hornet getting pushed out of the way and back to lapping up this delicious juice you can see them just fighting with each other just pushing each other out of the way. There's that ball-faced hornet trying to get back in on the action.
