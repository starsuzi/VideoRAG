 This drink is largely responsible for America's love affair with vodka, the Moscow Mule. Vodka's role in a cocktail is to brighten up everything around it and in the Moscow Mule it does that with ginger beer in line. The Moscow Mule is a really simple drink to make. Here's how you're going to do it. You need a high quality vodka, a good spicy ginger beer, a lime that will be used both for the juice and as a garnish. You can make this drink in any glass you like, but historically it comes in a copper mug. You're going to start by juicing one half of a lime which should produce about a half ounce of juice. Next, we're going to add two ounces of good quality vodka. Then we're going to fill up the mug with ice and top it off with ginger beer. And we'll finish the whole thing off by garnishing it with a lime wine. And that's the Moscow Mule, a vodka drink with a kick.
