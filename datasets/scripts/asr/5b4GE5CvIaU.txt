 What's up modern stedders we got a few little projects we want to do today and then we're gonna go for a hike down by the lake even modern stedders need to take some time off and have some fun right? What are you doing Pluto? You look hot. Are you hot? A little bit. Camera shy. How's the garden looking? I'm going to be looking at the sea. I'm already swarming. Those are the heirloom ones. I get with variety these out but yeah they're going to be goofy looking tomatoes. They're going to have the ribs in them like that. That is really deformed because that's two of them growing together right there is what happened on that one. I forget the varieties we planted but yeah that's a nice looking one. I'll do better like I don't have to share with them. That's right they grow a nice this year we can't complain. I think that's more in there yeah we'll have to add some more compost so it doesn't pack down so hard when it rains. It's part that I'm really encouraged about is we have tomatoes growing before we even have any summer squashes you're keening. That's an awesome score for us up here in Northern New Hampshire. We need to unscrew the two by eights and pry them off the concrete but don't destroy them because we want to be able to save them and reuse them. Two. Alright now we're going to the other corner and get that one freed up. That's so easy. These come out now. This one looks like it's going to come out easier than we do. Why? We're going to toss that all up with a sledgehammer. It's moving. You should have did two. Is it one hole piece? It is. Wow. Extra new too. No because that it won't stay together as easy. It's going to be a little bit easier than we do. It's moving. You should have did two. Is it one hole piece? It is. Wow. Extra new too. Because that it won't stay together as easy. You don't want the form blowing apart when you've got what concrete in there. That wouldn't be good. We'll work our way down here. Leverage is your friend. It's pretty. It's pretty. I had a gun that called Chipped Up. It's pretty. It's pretty. It's pretty. I had a gun that called Chipped Up. My tape corded your foreman. Oh. Pluto. Supervising. That one here aren't easy. That one came out easy. Oh. One. Keep going. You push or pull. Good job, William. Good job. You have a dance party. Go for it. Have a dance party, lovies. Break it in. I'll try it. I'll try it. I'll try it. All right, one right here, lovies. What do we got? A little tiny zucchini. Oh, we got some zucchini growing. That's a little bit looking for it. That's a summer squash. Better have zucchini. Look at them all. Where? Right here. Look at it. It's so cute. That one is like a leaf. Look at this one, that's twisted. That's twisted up. Yep. That's all that over. What? What is a snake? What is snake? I'm scared. So I think right here is jimmy thing. Oh, those berries? Yeah, I think that's a jimmy thing, plant. So I don't want to weed whack that down. I guess if the pig's eat it, the pig's eat it. But those should be jinsing roots. What's that? Oh, it's hot once in a while. So if you know if that's jinsing or not, leave it in the comments down below. I would love to hear what you think about it. Or like Gina said, what we can do with it. Okay, so there's jinsing. It was once jinsing with those ones are green. Not ripe yet, must be. Ready to go hiking? I guess so. You who guess so? I'm going to go in the lake. Yes, I do. Okay, let's go out. We'll go check out the water in the driftwood. Why is it clunky when you're drifting? Because it's drifting in the water. Somebody had a little campfire. I don't want to buy like a grape. I want to make sure this would make a nice little fish in the spot. Woohoo! You don't want to come out in the driftwood island? That breeze feels nice.
