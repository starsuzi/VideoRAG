 Hey guys, what color I have? Hi. Hi. It's Henry, my brother. Back? He's back. That's right. And what are we making? Snickerdoodles. But also Nana's. Snicky D's. Snicky D's. So tell me why Snickerdoodles? Why was this? Because Henry is obviously, as you know by now, he brings this laser precision R&D to like five things that he's really obsessed with. So fried chicken, waffles, pizza, ice cream sandwiches, he's very passionate about milkshakes, barbecue sauce he's very passionate about. So it's really specific stuff. So why Snickerdoodle over other cookies? Well, I always like the Snickerdoodles at Dede Rees. Yes. So if you grew up as my inspiration. If you've ever been to LA or like a basic, if you're a UCLA student, you know exactly what we're talking about. Your entire diet is based off of Dede Rees cookies. So why is the Dede Rees cookie your ideal Snickerdoodle? Like the right amount of chewiness. Okay. That's the key to the Snickerdoodle. A crunchy Snickerdoodle is worthless you've failed. If it's crunchy, just throw them out. So what do we have in front of us? Break it down. Alright, so one cup of butter, a cup of white sugar, a cup of brown sugar, one egg and an extra yolk, some medilla, baking soda, salt, cream of tartar, salt, teaspoon, and each, and then cinnamon for flavor. How much flour? Two and three quarters cups. Alright, well let's make some Snickerdoodles. Let's do it. It's our first. Get the butter. The butter. Put sugar on top. And then we cream it all together. Yep. Flour? Let's do it. Alright. Feel a little bit of time. So it doesn't get too long. Too difficult, you know. Just mix this up until it is totally combined. Great. Alright, so we'll chill this until it kind of stiffens up a little bit and then start rolling out our cookies. It's good. Awesome. Okay, so this is out of the fridge and we got our handy table spoon measure. Because Henry taught me about this. So tell me if I'm doing this right. That's good. See, yeah, like. It's like a good size. So I mean, I try to eat a little bit of scientific about it. So you gotta make sure that you're always doing like the same amount of dough for each cookie, or else like. Yeah. Now I roll it in our cinnamon sugar. Yep. So it's the easiest thing ever. It's just like, I think I did a quarter cup of sugar and a tablespoon of cinnamon. When you're done making the little dough balls, you want to cook them. I do it at 325, 339, for 16 minutes. 16. That's what I found. It's just trial and error. I don't know what the chemical explanation is, but I tried 15 minutes. This is a 1 to 5. I tried 17 minutes. This is a little too crunchy. I love it. Our cool, well, we'll finish this up and then bake these off and then eat some cookies. Oh, yeah. These look delicious. They also smell and I hope taste delicious. I mean, okay. Whoa. So you want that chewiness? Like. Wait, they're mega chewy. That's the key. It's gotta be chewy. No crunch. And there's no crunch here. No. I don't want no crunch. Crunch is a guy I can't get. No, sorry. It just thought a nose grubs were a huge, no crunch would make sense there. It was a no scratch, but it wasn't that bad. I think no crunch is a great hit. Are you a dunquer? Are you like a bite and sip? That's a weird bite. It's a weird. No, it's that weird. People do it should stop doing it. Okay. We did a good job. You did a great job. I couldn't taste the brown sugar. I was the key. It's really good. Oh my god. Well, truth in, this is great. Well, thank you so much for watching guys. I hope you enjoyed learning how to make Henry's sneaky d's. They're great.
