 Hi everyone! Today we are going to make a childhood favorite of mine which is chicken curry puffs. My mom would normally buy this on the streets of KL but I would always tell her that there was not enough ingredients. I was mainly eating potato so basically what I did was I tried to simplify this recipe by using puff pastry that is readily available in the supermarket and instead of frying it which is bad for your health apparently I am going to bake it in the oven. So today we are going to use minced chicken as our main ingredient which I am going to saute with diced onion and cute potatoes but before I actually do that I will marinate the chicken with curry powder, turmeric powder and red hot chilli pepper. So the red hot chilli powder actually gives you the little kick that you need in a curry puff. I would also marinate it with some oyster sauce, salt, sugar and chicken stock powder. I am going to start cooking now. 600 grams of minced chicken and this is the curry powder which is 2, 3 tablespoons of curry powder. 1,5 tablespoons of turmeric powder. Chicken stock powder, 1 teaspoon red hot chilli powder, 1,5 tablespoons. 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1,5 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce. So what we are going to do is we are just going to mix it in and we are going to let it sit for a few hours. The reason why I like to do this is because at least the marinade would have soaked in the meat. Okay, so I am going to put 2 tablespoons of curry powder. And then a bit of half a tablespoon of turmeric and I am going to put half a tablespoon of red hot chilli powder. Cool. Cool. Look at that. Beautiful golden brown homemade curry puffs.
