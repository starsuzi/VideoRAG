 Hey loves it's Blonna Sleen and welcome back to my channel today's video It's going to be interesting. It's gonna be juicy because I'm getting rid of all of my clothes I get so frustrated trying to look for something to wear and I don't even know what I have And I'm going to be doing this comari style This includes getting all my stuff out of every single drawer every single closet every single storage bin One two three four five Five different closets in my house. I don't even know there was five closets in this house Why call this in this house? So there are a lot of clothes that just don't fit me right anymore. I've outgrown them. They're out of style Also, I've gained a few pounds and there's some clothes that are not flattering anymore It's springtime. It's time to get rid of everything that we don't wear everything that we don't use anything that doesn't Brings us satisfaction because I spend more time organizing it and more time being frustrated When to bring it all into the living room and I'm going to give it anything that I don't want Which is about to be like 80% of my clothes we have closet number one right over here This is right off the entrance This is one of our coat closets that we have this is so embarrassing But this closet right over here is off the second entry way and it is by our kitchen And so this is like a catch all this is like everything and then we have scars we have everything from like gloves and You name it it's there look there's a coat right there that I haven't picked up since we first moved in You have another closet over here. We have some shoes and a bunch of stuff on top and We have some formal stuff in there which we're going to take out This is one of my main closets this one is in one of the guest rooms and There's stuff everywhere and this is probably the majority of the clothes that I wear this is my go-to Closets along with another one that I have but we got to get rid of all of this stuff as well This last closet is in the glam room It's so stuffed in there that I cannot get in that I get frustrated and so I don't even go inside of this closet at the time We've got all sorts of clothes here and then as we get down there. Oh my gosh That looks horrible. I feel like a hoarder. What is that a shoe and so oh my gosh This is horrible. This is why I need to purge and get rid of stuff So this is another closet. This is actually our storage room in the basement and I have Organized myself pretty well when it comes to seasonal items But in the book that I was listening to it says that I should not have seasonal items somewhere I'll store it in a bin because I'll forget about them that is so true I forgot about these clothes. I have these two bins that are seasonal clothes So I'm gonna take everything out of both of those and I'm gonna bring it out and see what I want to keep and get rid of and I'm never going to put seasonal items and I've been like this ever again because then I'll completely forget about them I've been looking forward to this day for a while now every second and reading that book or listening to it unaudible And so now I'm going to bring out everything out into the floor and when I mean everything I mean everything so we're gonna make some space and we're gonna take everything out of the closet first That are downstairs because these are all my winter clothes You want to start with off-season clothes because you've already worn them Throughout the season you know what you did wear and what you didn't you know what you liked and so for that reason It is just a lot easier and it gets your mind in that mentally state where you know you can get rid of something a lot easier and then this will make everything Else easier so if you're starting in spring take out your winter clothes If you're starting in the winter take out your summer clothes because the season had just passed and you ready to do it So I've been wanting to get a really really nice coat for a while now But what's been holding you back is wearing these and sometimes a little embarrassing because one's missing a button The other one is stained and so I just got rid of the the coats that I no longer wanted and then when it came to scarves Gloves and hats what I did is I kept two of each I kept two scarves two gloves and two hats All right, so I did the first floor first, but I am going to continue before I put anything away I'm gonna bring out all the rest of the stuff that was upstairs and that includes every drawer every closet every been Everything that I have with the exception of anything that's inside of your laundry because obviously you use them and You can discard them later, but everything else comes out on the floor in one sitting. This is just ridiculous. Oh my gosh Or a little cocoa. You're like what's going on? I Don't understand Now the reason why you want to bring everything out in one sitting is because this is going to allow you to completely purge everything You can mentally see and physically see everything that you have and so it makes it a lot easier to get rid of things That you don't wear things that don't make you happy things that are not flattering towards your body You just want to keep things that you know you're going to wear instantly and not have to think about and that's what I wanted Because I did not want to be stressed trying to try on five different pair of pants to see if they still fit me and me not being able to make a decision then they're lying on the floor and then it creates a huge pile and then you have to put those back away because you want to clean your house And it just doesn't make any sense So why not get rid of it right there and then so if it was dingy or if it lost a shape or I just didn't like it It didn't fit right it went right into the donation pile and then I made a separate pile to keep and a separate pile to sell Now how do you get rid of stuff that you don't wear but you paid a lot of money for for example like formal dresses Well the way that I like to think about them is that they fulfilled their purpose I had a good time in them. I got a lot of pictures of them. I felt good But I'm never going to wear it again Especially like bridesmaids dresses formal dresses or any kind of dresses like that So I would rather dress either sell it or donate it and if you know you're not gonna take the time to post a summer to sell it And you know that you're not going to have a garage sale anytime soon or you don't have a specific date in mind than just donate it Believe me it takes a huge weight off your shoulders and you can feel good about knowing that somebody else is going to enjoy that item Just as much and show it love love that you don't have for it because obviously it's been in your closet for so long and have been Hornet since alright what to do with clothes that hold a sentimental value Well, you can put them in a separate pile and then when you are completely done sorting through all of these clothes You're most likely to have better judgment whether you want to keep it or not and believe me by this time You're kind of tired. You're over it and you just want to get rid of anything that you don't want to completely hold on to And so you can get rid of it a lot easier. I have my lights set up so that you can see what I'm doing We have one two three four five six seven bags filled ready to be donated we have those which I'm going to sell we have this pile leftover here and we have that pile left And then there's a bin back there so far. This is what I'm keeping those are all the hangers that We're on the clothes we have more hangers over there and then that's another pile of items that I'm keeping and then these I have I don't know I have mixed feelings so much of them to keep those are not but I'll save those till the end So I already put all the clothes away and it feels so good to get rid of all of those clothes and then over here These are all the hangers that I use and I was actually considering to buy more hangers because I was running out of hangers For clothes that I recently started buying and so I just can't believe how many I have now So now that everything's cleaned up these are a couple things that I'm going to be selling on the app called Mercari So if you guys use my coupon code then you guys can get $10 off Stay we are inside of my glamour and I'm about to show you guys. Oh my closet looks like I narrowed it down from five closets to one closet And this is what it looks like And Then top we have all of my summer and spring clothes and then on the bottom I have all of my winter clothes and my fall clothes So starting from the back over here We have all like fixed sweaters color coordinated along with my flannels and then one pair of dress pants Which I have worn just one pair of dress pants in the past two years Because that is the only pair that I like and so I'm able to keep something that I love and then on top of here We have all my dresses in the back along with my short sleeves with the exception of this one Because that one is really light fabric and I wear it in the summer often and then all the way up to like tank tops And just really trendy tops and if you are wondering where the rest of my clothes are we have PJs underwear socks over there But it's like halfway empty these are my PJs look how much more space I have and it makes me so happy And then over here we have my shorts and pants and we have them all in one drawer no longer They in storage bins trying to separate summer clothes and winter clothes like my pants leggings Workout clothes bathing suits are all in here and it is so awesome And there's just so much room and I can put laundry away a lot easier All right, so we ended up with this many amount of bags I'm going to put it all in my truck and And it's ended up to get donated they didn't all fit in here There's something there too. I don't know if you can see in the back kind of put something in the back seat too But we got this make up this
