 A sunny side of bag the weights are cooked through not running at all and the yoke is vibrant yellow and ready to explode with goodness. Our ingredients are simple, it's simply eggs, butter and our seed for a weapon, just an ordinary spoon. Some people try to flip their eggs in the pan and call this sunny side up. Those people are nuts. This is well and fine and probably a delicious egg but where's the sunshine? It's hidden inside. Another method is to use a lid and capture steam to cook the top of the egg. The yoke is pretty but the bottom of the egg is overcooked and chewy before the top is ever ready. I know a better way. I have one tablespoon of butter in a frying pan over medium heat. You can tell that it's hot enough when the cloudiness of the butter starts to dissipate but make sure your butter doesn't brown. You can also use a tablespoon of vegetable or canola oil. It makes great looking eggs but you lose that beautiful nutty flavor from the butter. Here's the trip. We're going to cook the top of the egg with the butter at the bottom of the pan. It's called basting. That's what's basic. What's basic? Right now you have full control over how well you want your egg cooked. Continue to spoon hot butter over the top of the egg. When the whites are fully cooked and the yoke is done just the way you like, gently lift with a spatula and drain off any excess butter. I'm having mine on top of a bowl of Parmesan grits. And I'm having mine on more wheat toast. And that sunny side of bed is done the right way and I hope it makes your day.
