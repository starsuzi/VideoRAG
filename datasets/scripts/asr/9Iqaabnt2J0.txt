 I'm doing this video for one of the products I had that was asking that I kind of talk about the shifts and when I shift up the high range on when I shift down low range. So that's what we're going to cover in this video. I will say I may have to recover a gear or two. Sure goal, it will happen because I'm trying to talk to you guys about it and try and watch all the sequence back here. Oh you guys what I'm doing. Try this. Oh, jelebicus, no highway. Thank you guys for seeing me better than the last video which is awesome. So let's get this to try. I already pre-trip the truck in the trailer. Everything looks good. All right, I'm going to put the truck in a second gear. So for anybody that doesn't know when you push this over there's like a spring there. If I was to go straight up that would be reversed. Straight down would be first. If I come over kind of like the middle which is like on the other side of that spring that's over there. Straight up is going to be second. Straight down is going to be third. All the way over back over the side where it stops. Then you're going to have more than 10. So and then to come back on your high range of the bring you over then you would have six. Then straight up from the middle seven. Straight down from the middle is going to get eight. Go over to where it stops. Straight up is going to be your nine. Straight down is going to be your 10. So that's that's all 10 years. But we're empty. There's no load on the trailer. So I'm going to put this I'm going to put it in a second for this video. Okay, so we'll put it in a second. It doesn't hurt. We'll pull out slowly. All right, so we'll put a second here. That way that's a good way to go. It's your always good technique. Sure. So here. All right, second here. Because we're just going up a little ways. Check the high way. And then we're going to pull out of the guard down. So in a second here. And we have nothing. Straight down, yes. Shift down there. Straight down, yes. Shift down before. Shift down, yes. Shift. And then turn your foot up. Bring it over to six. You want to get out of the fuel. Raise it up. Put it in the seven. Turn the bill. Turn the bill and slowly get it going to nine. Raise it up. And then put it in the nine. We're rolling. We got it. Turn the bill. Okay, guys. So you can't see, but I'm coming up on the first turn that we got to make. It's going to be a right hand turn. I'm going about 35 miles an hour right now. I'm going to shift down. So I'm going to bring it out. Push it up. Push it up. Now I'm going to bring you back to your boat here. I'm going to get the green light. I work third, raise your hands. Now we're going up a little bit of the hill. We're going to the off the end. Bring it down. Put it up, put it in six. Turn it in seven. Turn it in eight. Now we got another light. We're going to even get a left hand through. So put our clicker over. Now we want to go to seven gear. So we're going to bump it up. Put it in a neutral. Pump it up. Put it in here. And we've got to come down to six. We're going to bump it up. Put it in neutral. Pump it up. Put it in six. Turn it in one. See I got a little bit dry. It's not that anticipating. I'm going to just close it up. One time, it's going to fall. I'm going to bump it up. Turn it in seven. Turn it in seven. Up. Turn it in eight. Turn it in nine. Turn it in nine. Turn it down. 25 miles an hour. We're going to skip the gear. So we're going to bump it up. Put it in seven. So we dropped that gap of speed to our key ends that we can come down and skip the gear. So I'm going to come down to six. We're bumping up. Put it in six. Now we're slowing down. So I'm going to actually bump it up. Put it in third. We're empty. So I'm going to pull off into the next one. This is so long. I'm going to pull over. I think I already can turn. Somewhere in third. I think I heard you guys. I think I heard you guys. I think I heard you guys. I think I heard you guys. I think I heard you guys. I think I heard you guys. As you can see, I mean, this is my fourth gear heaven my license. My fifth gear be at around the industry because I had my permit for about the first year. And I still have grinds, you know, but you have to be able to recover. If you can recover it, then you're good. So now we got a hill. So we're giving the RCM shifted out. Put it in nine. We're on a hill. Because the hill is going to pull some of that miles per hour and pull back on the RCM. So you want to keep your hands up there. You can pick it up. I don't know if I just cleaned it. Perfect. I don't know if I should have cleaned it. But it does make it easier for me to stay when you're like private enough, or you're coming down the hill, and you're shifting. Now we're going to get up to 10. So we're coming up here. Right to our fence. This is a good little patch that I've crawled on. I'm going up very short, but there is a ton of shifting in it. So I'm not it was perfect to kind of explain what I'm doing. And I hope I can do it in okay job with that. But I've got to get good, good little section of it. And I'm going to get a section of it. What do you guys actually see? The shifting happening and what I do. I mean, everybody has their own way of shifting. I can honestly say that I kind of mix my floating in my double bunching. I don't know what to ask. I don't really think about it both the time. I guess my brain just does what it feels. I'm just going to be shifting to the truck. And you know, not only just watching the ages, a lot of times I don't even watch the age I listen to the truck. And usually when I'm not listening to the light, just when I'm watching the ages is when I'll have a grind. Because I've tuned my ear to the sound of the truck to know when I should shift all of the time. I think a lot of drivers would kind of agree on that. That before you drive these trucks, the more in tune and in time to your ear gets to every sound that they make. And I know mine especially, and that's something I started when I first started driving, was just listen to these trucks. They'll talk to you. They'll tell you what they like for what they don't like. And if they don't like it, they're going to let you know. Okay, we're going to have to make another left hand turn. I'm going to come out of time. I'm going to make a very funny line guys. Okay. Just a good bulb or set up. We'll go right to six. That's bad. Wow, it's like dragging on floor. And then I'm rolling off. I'm just going to put it in there. Oh, I got traffic coming. All right. So we're in third. Then it should come to four. Make our turn. Turn, watch your trailer. Raise all that hands. Put it in the turn. Good. Look, you're up. Six. Now we're going to make our right hand turn right up here. It's not down far. So we're going to stay there. No reason to shift up another ear because it's such a small section of road. I mean, if you want to be like really bigger or bigger. We're not going to be a bigger. We got another one here. But we're going to stay farther. Click her down. Should put it in the front. Four. I want it. I just listened to what my brain wanted to do because I was talking to you guys. And that's why I tried to go to that other ear. Click her, it's all in that. Click her up. Should. Should fit over to six. See, I can hear it because I'm trying to. I knew it might have tried to bring that over. It was going to cry. Okay. Go on. You saw that? Hope you guys can see what I feel. And we got to stop side. So we're going to come out. Six. Click her down. Just a little more. Let's get third. Just a second. Go, guys. I can do it much better when I'm not trying to talk to you guys. But that's okay. I hope you guys get to just come in. Okay. So we're going to put it in there. We're going to pull off. We got clear. And we have a bath. And our destination. See that? I knew I could feel it. And I could feel. I need to give it a little bit more to open it up so I can put it in. And I could feel a little bit of fuel open that up. Put it in there because my speed was still all right. But I had to lift my arms up a little bit so that I could make everything in the transmission match up so that it would go and slow. It's understanding how that transmission works. And it's like fingers like this. And every, you don't, if you don't have it right. And it's like this. And we're going to get one of those off. Okay. We're our destination. So I'm going to go check in and we'll get back to this on the way out. Okay. So we'll get back to it on the way out. Okay guys. It's a tight. Okay guys. We're back riding. All right. So now I got to work the trailer and everything. And we got to load on the back. Pulling off in second gear. Going to slight incline coming out of this place. So, I'm going to leave on right here. Make sure those arkiats are up. And then we're going to move down the third. We've got our stop sign right up here. So stay there. That's where we're going right away. That little crack. You know, go ahead. Yeah. Hop in there just like that. There it goes. Okay. Let go of that. Okay. Let go of that. Okay. Okay. Let go of that. Okay. Okay. Let go of that. Pulling on in this place is going to be an incline. We got to load on the back now. So we know we got to get some arkiats off because we got that load. That load. It's always pulling you back. Bring it on our pms on. Okay. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on there. What is it? Come on up. Bring it on. You want to get right back down there. Feel it, too. Once it's in the rear, you want to get back. I don't have to. I don't want this happening. It's making it come over and it's in. I just want to see. I'm going to stay there because this is just a small section of row and something wrong. Now we're going to turn it off to this. So we're in six. We're going to click the flicker down to drag down the row here. Okay. I got it on some terrain here. So we're going to get on some space. We're going to stop here. I don't have that. Put it in second here. I want to get the row close to the other. Put it in second here. I want to get the row close to the other. Put it in second here. And now we're going to walk up to the stop side. I tried. It's very nice to have all my hair. So, other truckers out here. I'm going to just wait. I may need them or something. I'm going to help you out. You never know when you're on it. Somebody. Why? Okay. I've been here. Just go find them. I'm going to get them up. Then they go up here. Now we've got a deep line. There's trucks going to roll faster. Which means you're going to want to be quicker on that chair. Because now you've got that old pushing in. Back down the hill. You've got to make it up and right here. So, I want to get the row close to the other. It's pretty easy. I want to get the row close to the other. I don't want to fast. I don't want to slide. And get the quick one. It's just very short distance. Quick first down. I'm going to break the foot. I want to go to fourth box. I'm just coming out downstairs. I'm going to go there. So I'm going to get back to the third. I'm going to do the second. I'm going to make turn. I'm going to go there. Turn left. Turn right. One girl. She's just moving her own sleet up. Now I'm panning. Just flicker up. I'm doing it for that I would probably do. So you guys can see when I'm pulling it up. I'm going to go to seven. I want you to go to the other place. We get your area up, double-posh in, neutral, double-posh down. Do it again in a second. Bring your area up, put in the tweaked out, push in neutral. I had to pop it up in the back. I'm going to cut it like that. But so, push out, and push in. So, push neutral, push here. I'm not used to just doing it. It's hard to explain it. It's hard when it's done. You've got a hill coming up right here, so I'm saying nine. This is a real mass part of the road. That's speed, but it's not too heavy. So, and it's pretty steep, so we have to go another lap, so we're going up to the Jake's side, so we'll put that high. Jake's run. This road's only 50 miles an hour. Here, if it's steep, so, you're fine. If you put it, I find it by putting it in here. It's a good year because the truck along the road in the Jake's just walks the whole truck and trailer down the road with minimal braking to get these safely to the bottom without having my brakes heat up or anything like that. And we are having full flow after my study stuff. So, right now, I'm sitting right about 50. I don't have my foot on the gas. I don't have my brake. The truck is just going to the trailer. Our just walking themselves down the road. So, the engine brake is keeping it to the tractor and the trailer at the speed it needs to be going. Which is pretty much what you wanted to do. You want the truck to there's no snow, there's no rain or nothing. So, I know what I want to put the least amount of stress on the truck that I've been. Now, we're putting up to an even steeper part of the road. And I know it's going to drop down to 30 miles an hour. So, we're going to drop down in here. We're going to come down to 8. So, if I put it in 8, I'm going down to even steeper. I know the speed limit has 30 down there. I've been 8 here. So, I should be able to walk down this hill. 8 will give me up to approximately 35 miles an hour. But I know I'm going to go back fast. So, I should have been down. I had my foot on the brake a little bit when I came down off here. Which gave me a lower speed than that. So, I was already about that 35, 30 at the top of the hill. So, now that I'm coming into the tight turn, I have prepared myself for that speed limit to come down. I tap a having the load always pushing me down the hill. And if you can see I put my foot on the brake, I think once or twice. I just just slow-bred nothing heavy just a little bit. So, nothing to create a ton of heat. Now, we're going to come down and it gets tight in here. 30 miles an hour. But it's kind of like residential tight for road. So, you really don't want to be clients here. You don't want to have your jakes on here. I don't get up here and we're going into the finish. I try to repeat respectful people in the village too. If I don't need them, I don't have a sense of the language. I'm not going to have a sense of the language. All right. So, we're coming up now. We're going to make a lot of PN turns. So, put a blink on. We're in seven. We're going to have a few of them found with caring for that turn. Now, six. Now, we'll skip over, bring it down. Four. Just get the plus third. I will roll a lot. And I'll go right into a second. Now, we're ready to make our left hand turn. We'll make a green light. So, we got the green light. So, now, we're going to come up. We're ready to our VNs. Put it in there. Raise our VNs. Put it in four. Make our turn. Walk it out. Bring your VNs. Now, you're going to continue your shifting through your gear. So, we're going to go up to six. Raise those ones. You have to get their road speed up. You don't want to be holding up traffic. That's another thing. You want to get through those here. Not that you're going to do a work that I'm fast at everything. But you just want to smoothly go through that. What is the best food thing? When I was learning, a guy told me, you want to shift the trunk of my liking for next. And I give you the way. And so, what he was right. He did want to. What is it? He's supposed to be open here. So, the more rock you hide, the more dirt in your gun we have around. What is it? It's supposed to slide you to make it. Should go. You can't bring it right. Should go. And so, it's going to let you go or skip the. You can't beat that. I can make the turn to the right. Now, we've got to find the hell. So, what am I going to do? I'm going to get those hands up. You can move them. Bring it down. There we go. We're going to go up. Bring it over to six. Now, we've got that helpful in us now. So, we're going to go up to seven. But we're going to go quick. Because we've got those pushin' us. We're going to do the same thing. Now, we've got that going on the back of that going on the back of that going on. It's going to be pushing you down the hill. So, if you're going on, it's pulling you back. If you're going down, you're pushing you down. So, that's how you have to be watching all this and knowing and listening and hoping to stay to come together. So, you can see that they're still. Now, we're going to make a left hand turn. We're going to slow down. We should get up to seven. We've got to hold it. It's going to be pushing me down. I've got to go. So, we've got to be quick. So, we're going to get skip over that. We're going to go to the front. We're going to the front. See if we're pushing you down. And I can roll right up here. Put it in the second. There we go. I've got a little long. So, the truck's going to make that turn. Now, I got a hill's pushing me down here. So, I'm going to put it in third. And, seven seconds. Because that, what did I say? The road's going to push it. So, why do we need to get the truck in the trailer work harder than it has to? We're going to take off in third. So, we're going to work on already. Thank you for your turn. Get it down. Wait, then, what is now you want to start working to go to the end? I hope that this helped anybody that wanted to see the gears. I tried to put a little bit better of a meal for you guys so you could see what I was doing. And, you can just talk in the through. So, you guys can go to the truck. A name for watching, as always.
