We've got more mouth-wording recipes to come. Today we are cooking red split lentil dal or it's also called masoon dal. So let's get cooking. In a pan add about half a liter of boiling water. Now add one cup of washed dry split lentils. Adding your spices now half a teaspoon of garam masala, half a teaspoon of ground coriander, half a teaspoon of turmeric, half a teaspoon of salt. You can always add more salt at the end if you wish. Quarter teaspoon of ground black pepper, quarter teaspoon of chilli powder, of course more if you like your food hot. Give it a all a good stir. Now add two teaspoons of oil, one cup or one large chopped tomato, stir well and partially cover and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes most of the water should have gone. Now add another half liter of boiled water. Stir well, add two teaspoons of paprika. Paprika gives it a beautiful reddish colour. Again partially cover and leave to cook for another 10 minutes. After 10 minutes most of the water should have receded, mix well and the dal should be of a thick soup-like consistency. Mix really well at this stage to ensure all the water and the dal are really mixed and malgumated together well. Now in a frying pan add about a tablespoon and a half of oil. To this add half a teaspoon of cumin seeds. On medium heat fry the cumin seeds really well, don't let them bird. Add your finely chopped garlic, onion and ginger. Stir well until the onions are golden brown. Now add the onion and garlic and ginger mixture to your dal. Mix well. Finally add freshly chopped coriander. Stir and your dal is ready to serve. Enjoy with rice with chapatis or non-bread. We hope you enjoyed watching. Come back again soon for more map watering recipes from the curry cooks. And please don't forget to subscribe to our channel.
