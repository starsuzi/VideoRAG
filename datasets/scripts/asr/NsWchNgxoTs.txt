 Hello, this is Frodolef Channel and today we have a Jabura plant here today. So, at first we look at it and we only see these two flowers here, but we can fix that by doing something with all of these leaves we have here. So, what we want to do is take a pair of gardening scissors like this. Reach down deep inside of the plant and cut the leaves off at their base. You can take another one and cut it all the way down to the base. That's very important. What this will do is allow our plant to look like this. So, the important point here is that the sunlight is going to come down inside of the plant and allow our new flowers to grow up out. So, this style, it's very natural, but if you really want lots of beautiful flowers you need to allow the sunlight to get down into the center of the plant. Just like that. Thank you very much.
