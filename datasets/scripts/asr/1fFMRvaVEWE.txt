 I know a lot about hoodies just because I used to work in comedy. I feel like that's the unofficial uniform for people who work in comedy. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Today, we are guessing the price of cheap versus expensive hoodies. We both love fashion. We love fashion, but I don't try as hard. I'll say, I think the nicest hoody I own, $39. Like, nowadays, there are two shirts that look the same, but one store sells it for like $100 and one store for like $10. Let's do this! Ready, don! It's like it's a higher hoody. It's like more fashion. Is this supposed to be fashionable? I like this zipper on the side. This feels very Kanye West to me. That's the hoody. Yeah, I feel like a lot of stuff that's very inconvenient is just more expensive. $145. $160. Nid $30. I'll say $60. $200 hoodies. $125. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Wow! Well done! I should have gone with my gut. My gut was like, this is an expensive sweatshirt. 30 zippers. Yeah, it's like 30 bucks per zipper. We got a little bit of fashion right here. A necessary side zip happening. Double zipper? Oh, you can make a cape out of it. Interior like whining stuff? You would not get that in a like a target sweatshirt. I definitely think this one is about $75. $180. $78. This seems like the one that you would want to pay money for. $250. I'll say $120. $90. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ $249! I'm counting you. The zipper. I knew it was expensive. We were closer. The side zips. What? Good call. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ It's a zip up hoodie, so it can't be that expensive. This feels like an H&M hoodie. This looks like something I'd wear. Basic middle zipper. Come on. We all know that's not fashion. $35. I feel like this is $29. $50. I'll go $52. No, I'm going to say $40. $70. Damn it! No! $20. Wow! Ding, ding, ding, ding. Oh, this is cheap. I think that you could get this from like rocks or something or goodwill. This is something you got from props. This is a hoodie my father would wear. The 11-inch gun clone. Yeah! The material feels like what a lamb probably feels like on the inside. Scratchy, woolly. This is for sure like a sweatshirt that you got from camp. $55. Yes. $160. I'm going to say $20. I don't want to spend more than $20 on this. $75 cents at a church garage sale. I'm going to throw this out there. I think it's like $237. $100 for this? Why? Shut up! What the fuck? Oh, holy shit! What is in here? No. Gold. What is this? This is crazy. I'm going to put on a $1,000 hoodie right now. Yeah. I'm like, not mad at it. It does look though straight up that you stole this hoodie from someone else. I'm like upset that that is $1,200. I feel like hoodies became way more fashionable in the past like five years. So now brands are like, hey, let's just up the price. Stop doing that. The super expensive one, that's just like a practical joke, right? There's also a lot of features in these that I don't need. I don't need those side zippers. I don't need a mask over my face for I'm wearing the hood. Like, I don't want to buy something that looks like it's $20 and it ends up being like $1,000. I would rather pay $1,000 on like, purse. I was going to say a dress.
