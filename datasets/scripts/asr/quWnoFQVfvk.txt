How we make wheels in easy stuff. Let's start over the ingredients. The ingredients we're going to use for our wheels is a one cup of wheel. I'm going to use lemon juice and tapakio hot sauce. And let's get started. Oil is all heated up. So, let's start with the ingredients. I'm going to use one cup of my wheel to lock it so I can move around and I'm going to put it into the oil. Look at this. I started going to pick out. Look at it. Perfect. They're turning out really good. Doesn't take that long, within less than a minute. They're all done. And I'm going to take it out. I cut my lemon into half. And since we have too much in the box, I'm just going to use half. You need a flush, squeezed lemon and a tapakio. Good amount of tapakio sauce. Looking perfect. And now, let's cool it. Or you can use a plastic bag. Look at how beautiful they are looking. And you know how you go to the carbon nodes? That's the way the kids love it. They buy those. And they are so tasty. They're mouthwatering. So easy to make. And I'll do the rest later. And I just wanted to share with you. And look at how delicious they are looking.
