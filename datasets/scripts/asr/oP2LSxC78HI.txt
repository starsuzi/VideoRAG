 This is the white simplum with bearing tube so here you can see all these like stains everywhere it's just looking at it's really horrible and like you can just like black marks so I'm just going to show you a quick method of how to get this right to white. So I'm just going to clean this up just to use a topic bleach, by the time it's wet on the bleach and 100% going to get removed but it's a masking thing to do to quite and more surfaces so I'm just going to spread this like that all across the seam. Getting one of these scratch resistant scrubbers it's like an exfoliator. I just want to scrub it all around, scrub those surfaces as well as you can see it's instantly coming off. All the scrub marks so we want to leave this for up to 10 minutes for it to do its work. So we'll see the results in about 10 minutes. Okay guys so 10 minutes is done. I'm just giving it a quick wipe over again so it's all literally stained. It's sparkling and it's nice and shiny, nice and clean. The scent is absolutely awesome and I'm just going to proceed to wipe on the rest of the sink. Here we go just to kick a few walled stains have disappeared so I'm just going to dry this surface so it looks nice and bright and do the remainder of the sink. Hope you enjoyed that quick whitening how to wipe on your surfaces in your home. Once again this does wonders for winding surfaces. See you in the next one. Bye!
