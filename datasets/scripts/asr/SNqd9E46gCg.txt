 Hi, I'm Utin Lee. Welcome to my workspace. In here, I like to do most of my arts and crafts. Today, I would like to show you how to do a self-recover for the IPS SOSTA SOSTA SOSTA bit. Now, let's get started. Due to the color material, the SOSTA SOSTA SOSTA bit is the Etrax Dust. It also doesn't help when it's by three windows. Here is a curtain panel that I know long in the, I want to be used to make a cover. For those of you who doesn't know how to pattern making, don't worry, you don't need one. So first, make sure you start out with fabric inside out. Just care for straight on the fabric onto the sofa. Now the fabric is nicely tucked in. You can see extra fabric at the corner in the front. So how we start is by similar to origami. You see the fabric. And you'll pin the fabric first. Once you pin the fabric with the needle, you see the extra fabric that's hanging out. And you start cutting. After pinning both sides of the back and the front, you can jump into the sewing machines. If you don't have a sewing machine, you can try hand sewing them in the same way. Here's a finished chair cover. You can apply the same method to car chair cover, dining chair cover, and also taper cover. Thank you for watching. Hope you can use the same methods as of home furnishing problems.
