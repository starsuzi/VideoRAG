 Hey guys, I got a question the other day does paintball come off? If you go paintballing, you're gonna get something like this, feeling against walls or if you can't shot. And that isn't an overall that I use for paintball. And as you can see, I link them on a lot of walls and stuff like that so you can paint everywhere. And right now, at this point, it's straight up. It doesn't need to be straight up when you want to wash it. But this is the before I'm gonna show you the after so you guys can see how much of it actually comes off. So, it just came out of the dryer. And as you can see, it's pretty clean. It's not the cleanest, but it looks pretty clean. Almost everything did come off. There's just a few spots that maybe have some stains, but not 100% sure this is from paintball. You did see in the video that on the backside, there was a bunch of way. And now there's nothing pretty much. So this is an old gown that we have for paintball. Okay, it's an overall that we always use for paintball. And yeah, as you can see, that stains come out pretty easy. And there's pretty much no problems. So if you guys want to go with regular clothing, you can. However, you do have to get ready for any stains from other people's paintballs. Get stuck there. I'm not 100% sure these blue stains are from paintball. I think most paintballs are just white. So not 100% sure about that, but I can show you the backside. Once again, you guys can compare it to what you guys just saw in the start of the video. And you guys can see that pretty much everything came out. Anyways, that's it for this video. If you guys have any questions, comments, you can write them in the comments area.
