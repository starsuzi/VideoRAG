 Hello everybody, I am Matt Brook Point in the bullroom, as you can see. And today I wanted to show you something that I'm working on to clean up the tile around the pool. Whether this is the right way or the wrong way to do it, I'm just telling you what has really worked out for me very well. As you can see, I'm going to show you. Down here, there are two tiles. One has been cleaned and the other ones have not been cleaned. You can see how dirty that is, but when the new one is on there, it really looks a lot better. But what I did is I take a tiny little brush like this and I put a tiny little bit of this on there. And I'll show you what this is here. This is called vial guard, back up algae inhibitor and algae side. I take this on here like this and I scrub it. I scrub it just nice and easily. I don't want to have my phone go in the water. You can see how that has already come a lot cleaner. Just by scrubbing that, just little ways. You don't want to mix this up with the pool water as much as possible. It doesn't matter if this stuff does go into water because it's pool friendly. Go through and scrub out that grout in there. And you can see how that's nice and clean. Minus the little edges here. But I just put this off to the side and I rinse it off and it's like brand new. So anyway, that's what it has to be done all the way around here to keep that nice and nice and clean.
