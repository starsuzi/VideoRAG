 Hi everybody, how you doing? I'm Jodie, screened girl 3 and today I wanted to talk about a little dirty little secret that I think a lot of people have and me included. If you have a sofa with cushions that are attached, sometimes the door jumps on and people sit on and they start to detach. So what happened was I found somebody to come and repair them for me and I don't know what was harder to find in the guy to come and do with me or shellen out the hundred bucks that he charged me to do it. So I'm going to show you today for free on YouTube and the trick is like any good coffin to me it's good tools. It's a curved needle or a quilting needle that you're going to need and I got mine I have a sewing store nearby luckily so I got mine there but they have them from Joanne's fabric.com online and then you need a poultry thread in the coordinating color that would blend into your sofa cushion. So probably online you probably get it all probably under ten bucks. I think the needle was like a dial of 49 or something and then with the shipping and everything but this is definitely what you need is this needle and again you know it'll last a little while and by some time I mean I'd love to get a new catch believe me but this is just gonna have to hold me over and I've done it probably once the guy did it and then I didn't want to know and do it again. The holidays are coming you know I want everything to look nice to the holiday so so what you do if you can sew a any kind of line or hem if not maybe your mom or somebody that knows how to sew it's fairly simple you're gonna want to start from inside I hope that he can get it here and then come in so the knot is underneath you're gonna make you knot when you want to stand behind like I'm doing for some reason that's what the guy did he stood behind and it is easier and then you're gonna get a piece of this cushion and then sew it to the back and you'll kind of figure it as you go I don't know if it's getting my good motion but the needle really helps and if you take your time like anything take your time you pay attention and like I said you'll get it done and the needle is really the most important part of the whole process so let me show the needle again and the upholstery thread it's just a little sturdier than regular thread and you know again it's kind of an art not a science you'll figure out the way to kind of fluff the cushion and camouflage it a little bit but it's definitely better at least you won't be pulling it and you show that cushion underneath so it'll be that much nicer and like I said if you can you can sew a hem or straight line you can really figure it out once you get the needle and what else can I tell you that's about it so reattach it on it's gonna take a little time like I said a little patience and time but if you focus pay attention you get your needle you get your thread and I saved you a hundred bucks so thanks for listening to me I'll see you next time thanks bye
