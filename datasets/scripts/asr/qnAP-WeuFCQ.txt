 As some of you may have noticed from my last video that I put up the fry bake planting, we've been doing some upgrades to the show and it's because from Mother's Day that just past the kids gave me a brand new camera and a wireless laveleur or lapel mic to run the show a little bit better but they gave me those gifts and didn't teach me anything about how to use it. So in the last video I recorded totally in HD and then realized that that wasn't the best recording feature to use to put it on YouTube so that's why I parted that video came with a little bit digitized but that meal came out so good that I wasn't about to go redo it so I know you guys understand. Now on this one I had already recorded the intro and the extra and when I pulled off the videos onto the computer to start editing I realized that it recorded only in mono the microphone I mean. So I had to run down to my local radio shack and get an adapter and so now here I am recording the beginning and the ending and today's recipe is Joe's recipe for fry opera and so let's get into the making of the video if you notice that in between when we're cooking the meal that the sound is only coming through one of your speakers don't panic don't try to adjust anything it's because that meal was recorded already before I got the adapter okay but the next video after this all these bugs will be iron out and I'm sure things are gonna be a whole lot better. You're watching the Bare Pantry Show. So here's the okra and Joe bought it in the packaging this time he didn't want to buy the frozen kind so he bought this kind of the packaging and I'll show you when we get it all the packaging how to test if you're buying loose okra how to test to see if it's fresh or not but let's get it all the packaging we're gonna put it in a bowl and get it all washed. Did you hear that pop see when you pop the is that the tailor to head? I call it the tail but Joe says that's the head right right is that the head? Okay we have this argument all the time I don't grow things so I don't know but when you pop that ending part show the ending part for me a little bit better Joe okay when you pop that ending part of the okra if it snaps with a loud pop that means it's fresh if it just kind of kills over limp and bend then it's not as fresh but it's still good but I mean if you're picking them loose and you have an option get the fresh ones right so let's get them washed. Alright so we start from this end I say this is the tail because it looks like a tail Joe says that it's the head because of how the things were I say this is the head well we don't really know what the answer is but we throw this part away so just get the knife a cut like that I had the cutting board that way if you want to cut in the cutting board that's fine too and we throw that part away we don't like that part at all for this fried okra so this is what I'm gonna do with all the rest of it well I'm gonna get it cut like this and again you can use the cutting board if you want but we're pros right so we can do it this way so after I get this all in the pot we'll be back to show you what to do next see how much okra we got in the pot we cut it all up into these pieces normally we would do this in a skillet but it's too much so we're just sort of putting it in the six-squart pot and look over here see all the heads or the tails somebody write me a comment and tell me if this part is the head or the tail because Joe and I have this as a constant battle in here and he says for sure this parts the tail because of how the okra is grown in the ground I say it's the head because it looks like the cap of something so let's see who's correct and if he's correct I'm gonna apologize to him on another video so let's go over to the stove and see what we're gonna do next we're gonna put this on the stove with some water so it's on high fire and he's gonna add two cups of regular water do we need more okay he says he needs to speak a little bit more loudly he says he doesn't think we need anymore but he's gonna check with his spoon cool and the reason that Joe's helping me today is because this is one of his recipes that he's professional at and I just kind of mimic him so what what happens next Joe this cooks for a while for a while and get soft and we're gonna take the spoon chop it all up as you can see right away I have two cups of water and so we go edit more for a while all right so we get soft and we just go chop it up with the spoon and after that we've got the salt of the black pepper and the onion and on the oil and let it fry and we go there okay so he just like give you a whole lot of instructions don't panic okay because I'm gonna show you every step of the way what we're doing the next step we're gonna let this boil for a little bit and then we're gonna come back and add some of the ingredients he just said we'll be back in a few minutes this is 10 minutes later see how it's boiling and it's soft you know and I understand that some people don't like okra also so if this is not one of the recipes that you like that's okay I just happen to like okra so Joe has half of an onion here and he's just gonna slice it up in the okra right here we don't think we need more onions in that but if we do we'll get the other half and this is like a medium sized onion so and he's just slicing it in the okra and then are we gonna add some oil now to Joe okay so let me get the oil oh let okay he has a black pepper ready so let's watch that he's putting in his pinch that's a Joe pinch that's like a teaspoon or more of black pepper and this you put to your taste try not to put too much salt because John I argue a lot about the salt that he puts in this okra dish because I think he puts too much I think that's too much I really think that's too much but that's like a teaspoon too if I were cooking this I probably would have a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of black pepper and then you taste it and see what you like with a taste so let me go ahead and get the cooking oil for Joe while he's managing things oh he has it already he's a pro today and he's putting a little bit of oil that's about an eighth of a cup and Joe doesn't measure stuff when he cooks he's one of those old school cooks I measure everything because I want to get it correct and so he's just gonna use this nylon pot spoon you don't want to use one that's metallic because it's gonna mess up your nonstick pot and he's gonna continue this on for the next few minutes I would say about five minutes at least and he's just gonna chop do this in a chopping motion we have one more dish too that does this chopping motion type thing and it's the fried Kalaloo but for right now we're doing the fry okra we'll get to the fried Kalaloo in the future because summer is coming up and his Kalaloo is gonna sprout up in the backyard and we're gonna do that dish for the summer and so basically he's just gonna continue chopping chopping chopping to make this really really mushy and while he's doing that I want to show you something that I actually achieved today let's go over to this other pot okay so look at this regular rice and beans right but check this out I made it in a crockpot from start to finish beans rice everything I am so excited to do this video in the very near future because I want to show you how you can do rice and beans from scratch all the way in the crockpot so excited about this now let's go back to join his okra this is about 15 minutes later joded that chopping motion for a total of about five minutes then he walked away I'd say for about seven minutes or so and then he came back and he started stirring rapidly because it's frying I don't know if the camera's picking up these wrong spots there on the pot oh it seemed over or in the okra itself see some wrong spots that's what's actually frying on the bottom of the pan it's not really burned I would say high brown remember I used that before my odd telling you so I always say that it's not burnt it's high brown but you wanted that way it gives it that nice flavor and it has a nice smell going there's the kids don't like okra but even my older son Josh went by and said it actually smells good and the reason little Michael creates not because of the taste it's because of how slimy it is a lot of people don't like the consistency and I respect that because there's a lot of things I will not eat not because it tastes bad but because of the consistency in my mouth I can't I just can't stand how it feels in my mouth and so if you're a fan of okra I hope you'll try this recipe so right now Joe's gonna let this go for about how much longer Joe about three more minutes ok so about three more minutes and the black paper is giving him a lot of trouble on his nose bump my camera let's see what you get in above see beautiful I'll show you the finish front off in about three minutes did you guys notice how I tricked Joe in the cooking this whole meal for us let's go back on the okra this is about one more minute left to get this okra off the fire and you know what actually I have something to show you guys he never really turned the fire down see it's still on high it's still on high and right now we're doing a job at the shop you guys know we're self-employed and it's gonna give me some money that I could buy a brand new stove this stove is about 12 years old and it's about time for us to get a brand new stove so we're doing some upgrades to the show here all right Joe get it off the stove here's the finished product no I'm gonna eat this with my rice and beans today and some stewed chicken and I've always been a great lover of okra I'll be honest with you I used to eat this with my grandma and a lot of the things I learned to taste with her because the other kids ran away and I would just I want to taste it so I hope this is the recipe that you'll try and I promise you if you like okra you're gonna enjoy this because okra tastes actually very sweet when we cook it this way now as I've told you before when it comes to okra a lot of people don't like it because of the consistency the slimy taste that it has I happen to like the taste of okra but there's a lot of things that I don't like the taste of and when I cook the meal I always want to be honest with you to tell you if it's a meal that I don't necessarily like but I'll still cook it because Joe showed me how to make it for him you know sometimes when you're with a family and in a marriage sometimes you do have to cook meals that you don't like the taste of but if you're there and you're gonna make the meal of course you want to try something that you're gonna like I promise if you can get past the slimy taste of okra you're gonna love the way that Joe cooked this meal today because with a little burnt taste to it it really smells good it tastes good and all I ask is just taste a little piece of it if you don't like okra taste a little tip of it just to get the taste and if you don't like the consistency I really intrude to respect that so let me know if you cook this meal ok and coming up soon I don't know if I've mentioned it before but we're gonna be doing con soup, con fritters, crab soup we're gonna throw some desserts again in there so just stick with me and I promise we're gonna have some exciting new meals coming up for the summer thank you for watching I love you so much for subscribing and I really appreciate the people who have taken the time and invested the money to pick up my book until I see you again
