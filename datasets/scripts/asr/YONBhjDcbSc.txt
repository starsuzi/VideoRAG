 Hi YouTube! So I wanted to make a video about Arabian incense which is otherwise known as Bahor or Ud and the reason why I want to make this video is because back in the day when I lived in London I used to have a few of my friends who used to come over and they always would say you know always would comment about the scent of the house because my mom used to love to do Bahor all the time in the house and to burn it and the scent would always linger even when you know the days where she didn't burn the Bahor and all we would do it on our clothes and stuff so they would always comment on like the nice scent so and now that I've moved out and I live you know I live away from my mom I've carried on the tradition I did the Bahor in the house a lot of people from like an Arabic background do tend to use Bahor but I've noticed recently some people that who you know who are from different backgrounds are also you know starting to know about it and are starting to use it so that's why I wanted to talk a bit more about it how you burn it the way I learnt to do it how you how I learnt to burn it what to use it for and a few tips and tricks so I hope you enjoy this video and stay tuned okay so the first thing we're going to start off with is the Bahor burner which is well mine what mine is this big one here but I've also got a smaller one right here and the reason why I have two is because first of all if I need something that is a bit smaller to fit in a smaller space I use this or if I need to do the Bahor upstairs and downstairs I use one upstairs and I'm downstairs so it's good to have more than one and you can get them in all different shapes as well so you've got some that actually are closed at the top and these would probably be the best ones to use on your hair and obviously you'd need a Bahor which I keep mine in this glass jar this it was actually bit made by my mum she makes it from scratch like literally cooks it as all the ingredients and it's absolutely beautiful for anyone who lives in the Middle East in in particular in the bio cutter if you'd like to order some of this just get in contact with me and I'll let you know so that's what I use normally but then you can also get some that look something like this so this what I've just shown you is the Bahorias it's it's basically been mixed together with in with the scented oils and sugar and misk and all other types of ingredients now that can come in different price points you can get them quite cheap and you know they can get expensive ones but then if you needed something on a budget those are definitely the ones to go for Ud is much much more expensive literally so expensive I didn't even realise how much until I went shopping with my sister in my mum and when they were buying them some Hannah lives so expensive so I only got a little bit of this Ud is literally the purest of forms this is literally just the wood the scented wood if you burn this on its own it's very very strong and that's why it's so expensive to get one of these to get these basically and that's why I keep a little for special occasion so the next essential item is obviously coal you can get these you know magic calls which you just have to burn them for a little bit and they'll burn on their own for a while they come I buy the box but you can also get them in these little packets and they're like small little discs they're quite convenient because they burn very quickly but they also have a nice like the way they're shaped it's it helps to put the bojo on top of them to basically keep the bojo on the coal but then I also have this type of coal which is the type my mum loves and uses a lot of and it's why she gave me some and this is more the rounded one and you'd literally break it off the reason why my mum likes these a lot is because they they apparently they burn a bit slower and not so you know they're not so strong so they don't burn the whole too too quickly and then obviously you get that burning smell after some time which is what can happen with the other ones you have to take off the bojo quite quickly from the from the coal but these ones you just literally apparently you just leave it I haven't myself used them just yet but then my mum just brought them for me so I will be giving them a go and you'll need something to burn the coal with so I use a blowtorch but then people with gas Hobbs can also use can also put the coal on the gas hob with obviously the tweezers not the tweezers whatever they're called the little gosh I forgot the name for them literally my brain is just just like forgotten but yeah you use these while they they're not pliers or tweezers are they I don't know what they're called now but anyway these are very important because this is what you handle the coal with obviously when it's very very hot so you'll need one of them I just hang line on this now for the optional things which you don't have to I use but I like to use so I use foil to cover the top of where I'll be putting the the coal so I'll like this one rather than just putting it right here and then getting this all dirty and obviously having to have a longer you know time to clean it I just put that in there and then when I'm done I just pick it up and throw it away so it's really good to use on hands so dirty now so if you're using the pure centered wood I got a tip from one of my aunties is that you put a little bit of other on the wood and then burn it and then apparently the smell is so much more better for those people who don't know what other is other is a scented oil that people put directly onto their skin or onto their clothes obviously when you're putting your own clothes be careful of staining but this can also be used to add a bit of ump to your before or to your ud in particular last but not least when I'm doing bahor on clothes sometimes I give it a bit of extra scent using one of these sprays this one's from rasasi it's one of my favorite things to use I use it on all the poultry so even my sofas my carpets my curtains and obviously clothes and it just it smells I mean these are if you don't want to do bahor and you want a quick fix that smells a bit like bahor I use this they smell absolutely beautiful and if you want to accompany the bahor with something else this is also very nice they come in different sense I like the purple one and the blue one you can get them from the buy and I've obviously found some in Qatar as well um and they are they go for about 35 free out 30 to 35 free owls which is about seven pounds um not sure if they do it in the UK but I'm sure maybe online you could find it and it's called perfume aqua kousar now I'm going to show you how to actually burn the bahor okay so first I'm going to start by placing the foil on this on the burner and these once you start burning it you can see little sparks flying you'll know it's ready because it will have the a bit of a gray ash in the corners um and that is a sign that it's you know it's time to put the bahor on I'm going to be using the my mother's uh time homemade bahor and you want to pick a few big pieces and a bit of the because there's like big pieces and there's also a bit of like the crumbs so you want to put a bit of everything you can also mix so like uh sometimes I'll use a bit of mine but then on on the sides I might put another type of bahor just so that I get different sense you can mix up the sense a little bit which is wonderful now you see the smoke is coming out from the bahor and now it's time to obviously use it however you see fit so I just want to quickly mention that if you're going to be doing bahor around the house um first of all I walk around with it so that the scent gets everywhere and then I'll place it somewhere safe so if my son is sleeping I'll put it on the floor um but then if he's around which I usually don't like to do bahor when he's around because of the obviously the smoke so I'll put it on a table or somewhere where it's unreachable um you have to be careful though so once you put the bahor on the coal don't leave it for too long once it burns a while it'll stop giving a burnt smell so when that burnt smell begins you need to take that bahor off and if you still want more you can then place more bahor on the coal to carry on the scent but then once you're done you can then take off first of all take off the bahor onto the foil pot and then so that it doesn't carry on burning and then place the burner I like to put it in the toilet or put it in a room when no one's there until it cools down and it stops smoking all right so next I'm going to show you how I use bahor to scent clothing and obviously the third thing you can use bahor for is to scent your hair so obviously I can't give you a demonstration of this but for this I would suggest you use the one with the clothes top and then you literally just get your hair uh so use your imagination you get your hair and then you just um way you know move the incense burner around so that the smoke penetrates the hair and then you just move it around to the other side of your hair and you lift your hair up so obviously it doesn't touch the incense burner and then you just let the smoke literally penetrate your hair and then just do it for a minute or so and after that your hair will smell gorgeous absolutely gorgeous so that's it for today if you enjoyed the video don't forget to like and subscribe for those people who've never tried or never heard of it then you know give it a go a
