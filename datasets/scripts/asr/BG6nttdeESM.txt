 But boy that's where the big is live and I gotta show you the other. It's the second time I've got to go ahead and guys and I'm just happy to see this. Some of the stuff about that's a big four prong and then right here beside him and them two rich are born in a grand carousel we've probably got a real plant guys and that's a big four prong and then over past there here's another big big four prong. That's a huge four prong and so we have found some pretty same right here. I'm gonna get the digging some of this. My guy man that's what it's all about right there. We got the oh lower. I've cleared the die out and there's three big four prongs right here and they all go into one stem. So there's one top. This is those I can cover them where we can see them better and there's two tops and there's three tops. So I think we may have finally found something with the camera battery is good and everything working that we can maybe dig a real nice root out of here possibly I'll go into one root right here. I've never been able to do this because I always run out of battery or the camera's dead or forget the camera. So this might be a real treat for us. This might be the first time I've ever dug a root of this size and possibly three four prongs on one root on camera. So let's check it out. It's ready for come. I believe it may just be one day. It might be one of the biggest ones. You don't know what you might have. I believe it's one of the biggest ones. It might be one of the biggest ones you've ever dug. It might be the biggest one we've got on film because for one reason or another there's always something. The camera's dead. It's raining. And when we find them great big ones like this we hardly ever and see these rocks how you got to be able to do it. Oh big carol. Oh God. Yeah. Oh Jesus big rock don't you break nothing. You crazy big rock. You. I'm telling you this same has to go through it to grow down it. You sure it does. That's the big three four prongs. That's the big four prongs. Three four prongs. That right there. That's coming off one. Oh my goodness. It's my big it's untel. It's untel. What's you going, Cuff? We're going to have to be so careful here. I'm going to take a loud dig out boy. Yeah. I ain't in no hurry. No. No. There's water reach coming out. Come out here. There's more water reach. We're going to be real careful with them. Get out in. Oh, good. I'm tickled. Oh my goodness. I'm tickled. Oh my goodness. I'm tickled. Whew. Oh lord. It's like, you know what it's like. It's like here on a 12 point bird. When you got your bow on your hand, buddy. And you know, some people do it. This guy's a well-maintained buddy. But I love it. Oh, God. You don't know what you're going on, Cuff, are there? I don't. Yeah. I mean, they're definitely going in there. I tell you what, David, I'm so worried about them. Tops causing that to break. You know, them, I got them. I'm going to bite them off and save them. I got an eye too. You want to hear it cause now whenever it's them two, one time that I dug it, once that's what I cut them with an eye because I was afraid to break. Because it breaks them tops. Yep. You'll end up breaking them big. It's probably got quarrels on it like dimes. Yep. Yeah. Break them. Oh, I'm glad you had that. That's it made it easy. Yes, sir. Oh, yeah. Look here what tops. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. That's when you get the big hal going boys. Thank you. Yes, sir. Lord, that's so good. Bigger for no boys. Man. Yes, sir. Be careful. Oh my God. I can't wait to get that in there. So you may have got to wait. I've got to take my time, don't I, bruv. Yep. I've got to take my time. Is that the other top, bruv? Yeah. Oh, man. Yes, sir. Be careful. Oh my God. I can't wait to get that in there. So you may have got to wait. Oh my God. I can't wait. It's killing me. But you got to take the hammer. Yeah. You can't destroy it. That's 12 prongs, isn't it? That's the bait out there. Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God. That's pretty. It is, bruv. There's two four prongs and here's that nylon one. Where is it? Where is it? It's you, get out there. Woo! How are you? This is the house in one room, buddy. You don't know what my steel bait is diving down. It looks like it's still pulling pretty hard, daratah. Yeah, it is. Oh, I'm being careful, mate. I'm not being careful. I'm being careful. Oh my God. It's got very big, oh mustard, thangs on it, mate. Wow. Oh, that's good. Oh, look. Big tat. And it never happens, man. We're always either the films, the batteries down or we play the game. Yeah. We're always playing the game. Yeah. We're always playing the game. Yeah. We're always playing the game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We forgot the camera and the day we get to run into one of these monsters and we got the camera and the battery ain't dead. Oh, this is good. This is good, brother. Look at that. Yes, there it is. I can't not believe all three of them come off the same. I thought they'd be. I kind of thought it'd late and maybe two of them, but I figured it'd be another one. You know, it'd be kind of mad. Oh, man. What a pretty bunch of sand. I'm just saying, crazy. Yeah. For such a wonderful rate. How great is that? Now that I know and now that I can see where I'm going here, I can get that out there. Now I'm not breaking one of these. I just had to reveal everything. So we've got everything right there, don't we? Yeah. Yeah, there's nothing left. All the roots. Oh, look at her. Look at that. Get close to that right there, don't you? Look at that. That's why I did it. So careful. I don't want to break. One little piece. You know what? I say I don't just shoot enough over there, but everywhere. Big notch. So here's all the tops. And that's pretty. And three, four, probably. Three big four-pronged tops. Oh, gosh. That's beautiful. And then here is the root. Oh, that's a beauty. Nothing broken. Nothing broken, brother. Yeah. That's a good, perfect. That's a good notch. Yes, it is. Did you say it as a first and you saw it with the three tops? With the three, yeah. Three, four, pronged tops. That's first one. First two, four prongs. And here's that. Now I'm wondering. Where pronged? I guess you could count that. Yeah. Oh, that's a good notch. Nothing broken. That is a beauty. Nothing broken, brother. Yeah. I mean, that's what it's all about right there. We got the... Oh, lower. Oh, lower. Oh, that's a good notch. I mean, that's a good notch. I mean, that's a good notch.
