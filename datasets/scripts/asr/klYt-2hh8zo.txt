 So Lisa from New Jersey writes, I recently purchased a retirement home in Florida. Go Lisa! And although I love the kitchen cabinets, they are made of particle board. Can I paint them? Lisa, everybody's going to be really happy that you asked this because yes, you can, you can paint particle board. The most important thing to remember if you're planning on tackling this project yourself is this is all about the prep. So don't skimp on this stuff. Take off all the hardware, put it aside somewhere safe, pop it all in a baggy including all the little screws so that they don't drive you nuts later trying to find them. Start with a degreaser and wipe down all the cabinetry every surface that you're planning on painting. Let it dry and then give everything a light sanding. Really light, you don't want to sand through the veneer on this one. You can fill any holes with wood putty, again a little sand, and then use a tack cloth to wipe off that will get any little teeny tiny piece of dust that's on your cabinets. When you're painting your own cabinetry, it's really important to use high quality rollers and high quality materials. So by a great primer and use really thin coats with a foam roller, you're going to love the way this looks. Let it dry all the way in between each coat, different for every climate. If it's hot and humid where you are, you might want to let it dry a little bit longer. When you get to your finished coat, again, two really thin coats of your paint color that you want to paint it with. The safe bet here is really to go with two coats of primer and two coats of your finished paint color in a semi gloss or a full gloss that will hold up really well for you going forward. Some painters might tell you to put a coat of clear on top. You could do that if you like. But either way, if this sounds really scary, you could always hire a professional to do this for you. Lisa, good luck.
