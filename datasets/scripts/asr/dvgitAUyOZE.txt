 Welcome to the webs of Trinolax. In this segment we're going to talk about tire discoloration. What is tire discoloration? Well it is a problem and it's because residues form on the outside of your side wall. How does this happen? Well tire is actually formulated with four aditives that are actually added to the rubber, which bleed out of the rubber over time. They prevent side wall cracking to the rubber counter. The problem is once those aditives hit the side wall they become a nuisance and they're very difficult to remove. So we're going to show you how to get the residue off so let's get started. I'm going to use Trinolax platinum all wheel and tire cleaner to clean the brown residues off this side wall tire. I'm going to generously apply the product and let it set for 30 seconds. Then I'm going to have to scrub it with a brush. I'll after I lift this sits for about 30 seconds I'm going to start scrubbing. You can already see brown residues starting to get this off. You can actually see the outline cleaner. Next you start to turn brown. Next we'll rinse with the hose. Wow, it's going to come in clean. Once you go through this cleaning process the residue may still be present and you may have to do it a couple more times. Once the tire is clean it'll be a lot easier to clean in the future.
