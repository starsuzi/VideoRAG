 Hello, today I want to show you how to make probiotic drinks and today I'm making two probiotic drinks. These are very healthy and it has lots of health benefits. So this is tamarind pods and this is dried tamarind. When you break this inside like that and this is very natural and fresh. If you buy from the stores they sell some tamarind blocks but this is very natural tamarind and if you buy raw you cannot break you cannot peel this like that. So sometimes they sell the raw but this is ripe and I need this is 2.5 tablespoons rasuga and it's enough for both and 2 tablespoons ginger, fresh ginger, I'll divide it in half and 1 cup of pineapple chunks. I peel this tamarind and break in half and put in there and this is 1 cup pineapple pieces I put in the bottle and now I'm using 1 and 1 half tablespoons sugar for the tamarind and 1 tablespoon sugar for the pineapple because it's the tamarind is more sour and less sweet and the pineapple is sweeter so I use less sugar in the pineapple and 1 tablespoon ginger each one. So each one has ginger and you need to use the filter water to put in there. And cover this with the lid and leave this in your kitchen counter until it starts bubbling. So I'm going to leave this in the kitchen counter and wait it depends on your temperature in the house so sometimes they start early bubbling sometimes it takes too long so I'm waiting for the it starts bubbling. So this probiotic drinks start making bubbles and when the bubbles start making bubbles I put in the refrigerator but this process still goes on and it still makes more bubbles but it's slow and you can drink this strain in this plastic strainer and glass and you can drink half and put more water in there and just add little more sugar so the process really still goes on and when you put for fermenting I will stir with the Buddhistics two times a day. So this drink is very delicious and healthy so please try my recipe see you next time bye bye.
