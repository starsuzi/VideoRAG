 here you guys yeah this is Jay from video arts yeah here today we're gonna learn how to clean a car speaker yeah I did not find any video on YouTube so I'm posting this video so here we have a canward car speaker it's pretty old more than 10 years but still it works good and we can listen a good now now understanding and lowly songs with beautiful bass and good this is a canward speaker we have here and it's been pretty old more than 10 years old since these speakers don't come with a box we keep them and the back of the car on the board so they don't have any box down there so they catch pretty pretty amount of the dust and small things so today we learn how to clean this speaker first they help up my part is a mechanical engineer so with this help we just take the speaker from the car and just remove the bolt which is down from there you remove the screw and then you can pull this thing this accomplice speaker with the Twitter you can pull the Twitter out and it's pretty destitute you can clean that later and here we have this thing the speaker now yeah it's pretty rusty you can hear the sound it's pretty rusty down there the thing is that here you cannot open the speaker till here only you can do is double the screw and take off the tissue that's it I don't know how to do that but with my father I figured this thing out so you can see here this thing when you do like this it it sounds pretty bad the same sound when you hear it when you play it with the song so now we shall see how to clean this thing here see here my father has one of the other speaker he's doing with a film strip so a negative negative from an old camera so you can take that and insert it inside and then you clean it you can see the dust you can see the dust see you can see the dust scratching the negative here the main the dust is so quartz and it's spoiling all the negative that means you have a lot of dust inside so tricky is that you just take the negative and you just hold it a little bit so that it enters the hole and then you insert it and you clean it and then you get the final audio that's it
