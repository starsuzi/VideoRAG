 So I've seen some people's posts about how they make grilled cheese sandwiches with the toaster. So I decided to try it myself, see if it actually worked. Here's my experiment. As you see, I got my cheese and my bread and my toaster. All I do. Tip this sideways, I tried this out earlier. It was pretty cool how it worked. Make sure you put the cheese with the bread with the cheese on the bottom. Make sure it's just in case the cheese melts, but sure it doesn't. Slide that in there, then put the other slice up here. Then we push that in, slide your toast in, and pretty soon you'll have grilled cheese sandwich. Then just wait for it to pop out. The best part is when they actually pop out of the toaster. You'll see here in a little bit when it pops out. I don't know if you can see this. It actually does start smoking a little bit. Do not be alarmed. It's probably just bread crumbs. Do not leave while you're doing this. Make ketchup on fire, who knows. I'm sure toasters are not designed to do this. This claim or do not try this at home. And wait here and look at that. It popped out perfectly. Slit on top each other, and we got a perfectly grilled cheese sandwich here. And in the middle we got perfectly melted cheese. That's how it's done.
