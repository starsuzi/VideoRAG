 We're going to start with our 8 inch chef knife, cut off the bottom, cut off the top. These could later be used for some garnishes, if you like. We're going to use the knife and cut off some of the peel, and then we're going to use a peeler as well. I just find the knife to be a little bit faster, at least for some of this. I want to take off about a quarter of an inch, so you're not wasting too much, and you're not eating the outside peel. Cut the squash in half, very carefully. Remove the seeds with a spoon, circular motion. They came right out of there, nice. Okay, there's two ways to julienne. A julienne is 1 eighth by 1 eighth by 3 inches, approximately. We're going to cut this off here first. We're going to cut a nice slice, approximately 1 eighth of an inch, straight down. And we're going to keep the fingers rolled back, and just go like this, up and down, up and down. Nice slices here. Okay, that is a nice julienne. Okay, this next quarter, not squash, we're going to do this as a julienne using our mandolin. This is the best mandolin you can buy. It's a brawn, B-R-O-N, available at chefdebo.com. I recommend using a cup glove. This is a cavlar glove. It's very hard, very tough to protect you from hitting the blades. You just dismantle it down below. This raises and lowers the plate for how thick you want the items to be, the food to be. You can rotate from skinny blades to thicker blades. Use that angle like this, set up. Okay. Next we're using our mandolin. I've got my cup glove on here. This is cavlar. And we're going to go back and forth. This is a julienne from the mandolin. Okay, this sputtering up squash here is going to get steamed for about five minutes and then sauteed very quickly with garlic, salt and pepper, olive oil. That's it. Very delicious. It cooks very quickly. We're going to steam it just a little bit and then we're going to saute it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
