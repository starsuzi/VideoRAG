 Okay now I'm going to check my soapy water flea trips. I can't really see anything on the background. I do have a white looks like there might be one in the corner there. So they do seem to work. Well yeah there's definitely one in there. Let me see if I can focus on them. There you go. And the soapy water flea trip. These also seem to work quite well. Oh there's another looks like there's one under there. Ah the white background. You can see two fleas. It's only a tiny size comparison. A tiny little lid for a tap away box. This one seems to be the most successful. What I'll do is I'll just pick this one up and put it on a white background without spilling it on everything. Okay I don't know if you can see that. I'm trying not to drop my phone in it. That lots of fleas in this one. So I think the key is a lot more soap than I've put in the other ones. Otherwise they don't seem to catch the fleas. So we'll change the rest and see how that goes.
