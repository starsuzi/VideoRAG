 Hello friends welcome to Babi's gluten free, sugar free, soya free and daily free kitchen. And today we are going to make very basic blend of gluten free flour which we can use in any recipes. You can make bread, you can make Indian chapatis, you can make banana bread, you can make cakes out of it, you can make buns out of it, you can make bagels out of it, you can make like thousand different things out of this. But this is the basic flour you need to make any gluten free recipe. So for this recipe we need one cup of rice flour, one cup of tapioca flour which is known as sabudana flour, we need a half cup of potato starch or you can use potato flour, we need one cup of millet flour which is known as a bajra flour, and we need a one cup of sorghum flour which is known as jowar flour. And this is lentham gum which is available at any supermarket or grocery store, I buy this from Walmart and every one cup flour we are going to go ahead and add one teaspoon of lentham gum. So we already have like 4 and a half cup of flour, so we are going to add like 4 teaspoon of that, or you can use gargum as well but gargum is little like it, when you use it it have little like olive effect, and when you want to use that for your daily use, you rather want to use the lentham gum but it's up to your choice. Now this lentham gum is going to give nice and gooey stickiness, like a gluten effect to any recipes we make out of this flour. Now everything is you have to do is stir, mix really well. Or you can put it like in a big plastic container and close the lid real tight and just shake it, you know. Our gluten free flour mixture is ready, and you can make anything out of it, you can make like nons, bread, you can make a 2 days out of it as well. So just go ahead and try it, give me a thumbs up, if you like my video please subscribe and I'll come back with some more recipes. Thank you guys.
