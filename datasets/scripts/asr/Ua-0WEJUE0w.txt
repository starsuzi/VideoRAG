 My name is Peter Simons and I was the Western Australian Turf Club's official vet, Nairin, from the late 80s through to the early 2000s. In that time, I examined thousands of horses. It is a fact that all horses are susceptible to joint disease at some much sooner than others. For that reason, I hardly endorse any joint product and is reparative. Products that actually heal rather than just hide pain. New Zealand Green Lip Muscles have a unique combination of ingredients. They've got glucose men and control it in sulfate, omega-3 fatty acid and also hyaluronic acid. So I recommend joint rejuvenate for many reasons, but especially because it's scientifically processed to ensure that all these particular ingredients are protected.
