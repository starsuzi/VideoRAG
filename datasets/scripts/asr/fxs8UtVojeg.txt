 Get ready for some ooey gooey slime-tastic fun. This is Jen from TTPM and I'm here with the Nickelodeon Slime Super Slimey Kit from Crazy Art. And unless you've been living under a rock, you've probably heard that slime and slime making are back in style. The hashtag slime has been used well over 2 million times on Instagram alone. But one of the biggest problems with some DIY slime is the process often requires glue which has become hard to find as well as chemicals that are definitely not kids safe or parent-approved. Which is why this kit is so great. It comes with everything you need to not only make basic slime, but customize it with colors, scents, glitter, and crunch. It's easy to do. It took us about 5 minutes to just make a simple batch of glow in the dark slime. No matter what type of slime you're making, you'll always start with the same basic steps of mixing together equal parts, glue, and water using the included measuring cups. Then simply add the necessary additives to customize your slime. So for example, we had to add one spoonful of colorant to the bowl and about a third of foam beads for a colorful foamy crunchy slime. That's the first part of the formula. The second part requires a second bowl, which you'll use to mix 2 spoonfuls of slime making powder and 15 milliliters of hot water together. We definitely suggest adult supervision for mixing this step since the water needs to be very hot. Once the powder is completely dissolved, mix it together with the first bowl until it thickens into your perfect slimy consistency. Overall, we loved how easy this was to do and that it really takes a lot of guesswork and potential dangers of slime making at home out of the equation. The Nickelodeon Slime Super Slimy Kit is from Crazy Art and it's for ages 6 and up.
