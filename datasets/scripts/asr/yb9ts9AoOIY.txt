 Alright, this is a Vitamix grinding coffee. Will it grind? Aæ›¾ It's about half full. I'm going to try out the consistency of an espresso grind. Very fine. Partly through the grinding process, you realize there's a really good idea to have a spatula or something to stick down the center hole to mix it and stir it as blending. Maybe to try a little coarser blend, but I mean, didn't find jobs. If the espresso is your goal, you can definitely get that pretty easily. It might take a little more fine tuning to get a coarser grind.
