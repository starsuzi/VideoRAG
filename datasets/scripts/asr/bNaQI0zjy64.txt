 Down here in Los Angeles helping these people with a little supervision installer Jesse Red Rock landscape. His boulders traveled about 35 feet so far. The ancient style but no Zia that has spent a lot of money on heavy equipment and by using these rollers and some timbers and a little back work we've got it all the way to the street into the planner bed. One thing is that I saw this plastic edging. I see this everywhere. I cannot emphasize enough. Dunny's plastic edging is just all shit. I don't care how you use it. It's always shit. It expands in the summer, contracts the winter, begins to come apart, photochemically decomposes. So especially on a straight edge like this. So I got them some redwood, some two by four redwood. I'm going to replace this plastic edging with the redwood. Make a really nice clean straight edge that'll hold up over time. I'll come back here in a week. See what kind of progress they've made. Get the rock all washed off, get the boulders settled, maybe help them pick out some perennials. But please minimize the plastic edging.
