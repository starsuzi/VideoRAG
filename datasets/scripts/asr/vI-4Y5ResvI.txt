 Hi, welcome back to Putsal Kitchen. Today we are making Parmesan crisps. I have some grated Parmesan cheese here and one Parmesan crisp is about a tablespoon of cheese. So I'm going to put a heaping tablespoon and just pat it down gently onto a cookie sheet that is lined with parchment paper or if you have a silk hat which is one of those silicon liners the cheese will come off perfectly like that. So I'm just going to make probably about two per person. I would say if you make more they will go. People love them and I'm serving this tonight. We have tomato soup but it also is an excellent accompaniment to pasta and these little Parmesan crisps are so easy to make and will make you seem like a gourmet to whoever is eating it. I'm going to pop this in a 400 degree oven for about three to five minutes or until it's kind of a golden crispy brown, golden brown and delicious as we used to say in culinary school and I will show you what they look like when we're all finished.
