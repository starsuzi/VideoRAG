 Hi, this is Brent with Vintage Statements and today we've got a nice dresser that we're going to redo. Going to get a nice white antique look. Everything looks like it's in pretty good order. Just going to give it a nice sand so the paint sticks really well, give it a good clean, get a painted and we'll get it on the tree today. So first step, get all the hardware off, second step, sand. Alright, we've got it sanded, we've got it wiped down, now it's ready for some paint. We're going to go with pretty much a pure white, give it a nice two coats, scuff it up a little bit and get this up for sale. So let's start painting. Hi, it's Mary's Vintage Statements. Hope you guys are having a great weekend. We just finished up a beautiful nine drawer, could be a dresser or buffet. It's got some great storage hidden behind the door for three more drawers. It's a pure white, scuffed up and I think it turned out awesome. So check us out on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, subscribe to our channel and we'll see you next weekend.
