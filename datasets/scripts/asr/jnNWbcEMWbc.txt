 Hello everybody, welcome back again. I'm here. I have a plant which is the prayer plant and she is so long you can see how long she is extremely long look at that so long she's hanging over the pot so what I'm going to do is get some cuttings out of it and you see my hands are nice and dirty I just planted a plant and I'm gonna upload that video too so what I'm going to do is take some cuttings she has flowered for me last week she was doing making me a flower so we're here it's already dry it was this one it's already dry she does flowers a lot and I never realized that she it's only one plant this one right here you see that it's one plant apparently it spread over here from this plant see it's from this plant see this plant it came here and it rooted right here see it stuck in there it's hard it rooted itself and look how she's doing growing my god it's so gorgeous how gorgeous is that look at their leaves so gorgeous and she keeps on growing there's a new one behind her like a little roll there and I was shocked like she got stuck in there she rooted on the soil okay so I'm going to add another prayer plant in there because I took out the paparomia which you'll see the video I'm gonna put the another prayer plant which is a different style the same prayer plant but different color which is this one so I'm going to plant that one in there so let's begin so she can be with her own people her own plants no more sharing with the paparomia so now the paparomia has its own home all right so hopefully you can see everything I try to film by myself because I have no one to help me you're just gonna make a hole you're not damaging anything to the plant you're not doing nothing to the poor plant don't worry because she's well rooted in there now I'm gonna do is just take out the plant from the pot the other plant and just take out the dry leaves these dry leaves that are here just take them out or cut them out with a clip with a clip here okay these are hard okay just pull it out there we go okay so now no dried anything and actually you can see her roots are really root bound so we're gonna do just kind of loosen the roots just loosen them up a bit so they can spread in the pot okay just kind of loosen them gently trying to let them let her know that she can spread the roots inside or you can just stick it or stick her in there just like that but I like to do that okay so I'm gonna plant her this way so she hangs this way so just rotate your plant to see which way you like it better so I'm going to put her in that hole like so and just cover her up there and just add a little more smerico grow or potting mix so usually by the premium potting mix okay so we're just add just add the soil like that and just be gentle say hello to your neighbor or to your sister or some siblings late siblings because she is different okay so I need to add more I'm using the same pot to pour more prayer plant must be wondering what's going on here I got so many plants this month the beginning of the year guys I got so many plants okay she is well now she's ready I'm gonna add a little bit more for the prayer plant okay give her some here too for her for my beauty my little beauty and then I'll just cut some of her stems a little bit do some cutting now to do the cuttings I already have a cutting here but be warned these cuttings they do take a while what I do is take out water every day in a one liter jar glass jar a pretty jar because I like to keep it on the counter to make it I don't know I put some marbles and and knife color and it looks in the bottom and I leave it on the counter looks nice and then I use that water because I just let the chlorine evaporate and then I use that water to water my plants now what I do is I take out all the dry stuff first like you just pull it down words so it comes off all right throw it okay so what I'm going to do okay this one is fine because she rooted there so I'll leave her for now but this tremendous long one I'm going to do cutting so I'm gonna do a cutting on this now we want to do cuttings like in each node for example here here is this is a node right here okay and right here is another node right here right here it's another node roots will come out of there and this one too I'm going to cut this one until I'm gonna put her here okay so I can get like three plants out of this this long stem what I want to show you is the roots look this has roots it has little dots in there I don't know if you can see it maybe you can see it like that it has little dots the roots will be coming out of there maybe this one will be better look at that this one you see that that is little dots of roots gonna come out all right my friends so this I will stick in the water okay so I'll just cut it I'll cut it here I'll cut it here all right so this is I will leave only one leaf take these two out and I will stick this in the water like so okay like so stick it in the water like that and that's it okay so this will root and just change the water every three to four days or if you see the water kind of opaque or not clear change it okay all right my friends so thank you very much for watching and thank you all for your support so you can see this beauty right here those these two look good together since this pot is huge so why not put them both in the same pot since they're both the same the prayer plants all right so here's the prayer plant and I love the patterns the design on these leaves I call it designs because it's so beautiful I'm so in love with it and underneath this purplish and dark and I cut the stems as you know and you can see look at the roots they are growing and it's not not not even a week and it's growing I thought it would take more longer than that but it actually may is making roots I'm doing it towards the light let me see if I do it on towards this dark spot you can see the roots isn't that gorgeous and some of the stems have double roots one on the top let me move my finger one on the top and and also in the bottom I'm like oh my I should have made two pieces but hey I'm glad it rooted in water and as you can see it is so easy to root them in water all right my friends
