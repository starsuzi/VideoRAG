 Hello everyone, in this episode I'll show you an amazing reaction between ethanol and potassium permanent gnat. For this reaction we need SL alcohol, concentrated sulfuric acid and potassium permanent gnat. Firstly, let's put some potassium permanent gnat into our operation bowl and add several sulfuric acid drops. After a while, strong oxidizer manganese oxide 7 is formed from potassium permanent gnat. Let's take a droplet of manganese oxide and drip an ethanol droplet on it. Add contact of alcohol with manganese oxide, alcohol instantly ignites. Let's do the same in this operation bowl. The reaction is very rough and sometimes is accompanied by an explosion. This is what happens. Manganese oxide decays into manganese dioxide and alcohol burns down women a small amount of acidic aldehyde. Subscribe to my channel to learn about some more astonishing reactions.
