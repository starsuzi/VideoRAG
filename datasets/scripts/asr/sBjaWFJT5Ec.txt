 Hey, this is Eric with Post-Pock, Screep and Don, you're behind the camera today. I'm a friend Nick. And I'm Nick. That's Nick. We're going to show you how to make a grilled cheese in the toaster the right way. All you need is bread, a toaster, obviously. And cheese, maybe some scissors, and most importantly, aluminum foil. The reason why I got the scissors is because we don't want the aluminum foil to be too thick around the outside. So once I find out exactly what size the sandwich is, I'm going to cut around it and leave myself just a little bit of foil around all the edges. And then we're going to fold up the edges around the sandwich. But again, we only want one layer of foil between the heating elements of the toaster and the actual sandwich. Nick, you're doing a great job. Thanks. Now, here's our little foil-wrapped cheese sandwich pouch that goes in the toaster. Just a little bit more toaster on the highest setting. And go. Now we wait. How long does it should take? I don't know. Let me use all fucking notes. All right. Woo! Oh, I thought it wasn't supposed to be hot. Shut up. I need something to grab it with. Yeah. Ow! Screep, would you like to do the honors? Okay. I am opening up our little foil package and there, ladies and gentlemen, is a perfect, hot grilled cheese sandwich. I'll be honest. That looks delicious. Looks pretty much amazing. All of this extra tin foil is going in the recycling bin. That's how it smells. I'm just going to go ahead and say that right now. That smells like an electrical fire-weighting happen.
