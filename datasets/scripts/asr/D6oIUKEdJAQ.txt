 In today's tutorial I'm going to show you the quick and easy way to make spaghetti with Italian sausage. All of these ingredients can be altered so it doesn't have to be exactly what I'm using. You can use different type of sausage links, sauce and noodles. In a deep pan I'm going to have some water boiling. Then I'm going to add my noodles and they may be like halfway in so I'm going to add just a little bit more water. And so while I let that sit I'm going to go ahead and work on my sausages. So we're going to cut the sausages. You can cut them in this size which is pretty a good size meatball or you can cut it straight in half and then cut again in half. And that's just going to reduce it of course in half. In a pan I'm going to add some oil and then add all of my sausages. Let that cook for a little bit. Then I'm going to add some oregano seasoning. And then I'm going to add some red crushed peppers. Now this is not authentic. Let me repeat myself. Not authentic so you are not getting the whole Italian experience with spaghetti and sausage. You know what? I'm just this is just the fast way to make it. If you want this type of a meal you can do this in less than 20 minutes. So as you can see I'm going to now drain my noodles and what I did in order for it to stop from going actually touching the sink. I just put the lid underneath it. And so now I'm going to add this to another pan. I'm going to pour my sauce inside. I'm going to stir that up so all the noodles get in the mix. Now I'm going to add a little bit more oregano to the actual pasta. And now it's time for my sausages. And that's it. Again it's going to take less than 20 minutes to make this meal. So if you're on the go you need something quick. Here's a perfect meal for dinner tonight. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time.
