 When installing a panel or rail and picket fence, the steps are pretty much the same. It will require you to measure out the distance needed between the posts. Dig the holes for the posts and to set them. Once the posts have been installed, you'll need to attach the panels or rails and pickets. The posts can be set anywhere from 6 to 8 feet apart for stick build, but if installing panels, you must make sure the post placement will allow for the panels to meet in the center of the posts. When digging the posts holes, make them about 3 times wider than the posts and half as deep as the posts are long. Placing gravel in the bottom of each hole before setting the posts will provide the needed drainage. As with any project that requires digging, call 811 before you start. Your local utility companies will send someone out to mark the location of any underground lines or pipes.
