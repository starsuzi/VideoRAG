 Hey everybody, welcome to Namaq Merch masala. So today we're going to show you how to make mango gulfi which is basically in an ice cream. So for this recipe you need the following ingredients. 15 ounces of mango pulp, 16 ounces of heavy whipping cream, 12 ounces of evaporated milk, 14 ounces of sweetened condensed milk, two white bread slices, and you're going to go ahead and you're going to toast that and let that cool. And once that's cooled off, you're going to go ahead and add those white bread slices to the blender and you're going to grind it until it turns into little crumbs. Then you're literally going to take everything and just add it in the blender and you're going to liquefy it. We'll end up with a mix that looks like this. And then you can go ahead and take that and add that to little cups. We're using souffle cups here and we're just capping it off with the lid. Then go ahead and freeze it overnight and that's it.
