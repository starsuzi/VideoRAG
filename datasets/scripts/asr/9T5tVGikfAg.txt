 Here it comes. Hey, Booger. And if you're watching this, you probably are tired of leftover turkey from the holiday. So I'm going to share with you my turkey casserole recipe. And it's pretty good. And it's so simple. I'm sure you have all this shit out on it. It's already in your pantry. I know it is. If it's not, don't worry about it. You can substitute almost anything if you Google it. So first thing you're going to do is you're going to cook yourself some rice. Okay, this is two cups of water. One cup of rice. It came up to four cups of cooked rice. I'm going to put them not going too fast. But anyway, almost four cups. You know what I mean? Cook one cup of rice. Okay. Then your boil is self-three eggs. And then you cut them up. So those are the two things. Okay. The turkey is about two cups of turkey. And that's all the little bits and little ends and pieces and stuff. So make sure it's bite-sized. Cut up. Okay. I take it up and I'm going to mince. Then not too thin, but then I'm using pecans or pecans. That's a have cup. You can use walnuts. It's usually walnuts, but I had pecans. Okay. You're going to need some lemon juice, some corn flakes, you're talking. And I melted half stick of butter. Have that ready? I can't approve of chicken. Don't use cream on mushroom. You ever tried cream or chicken? It's like I had a different ballgame. Cream of mushroom is so great. Try this one. Okay. Salt and pepper. And all this stuff. I'm going to change the angles so you guys can see me mix it together. No, because you want to see this. Okay. So let's change this stuff around. All right. You guys ready? Of course you love. Okay. So, drop our onions in there. Drop the nuts in there. And then salt and pepper. That's pepper. Like a little bit more pepper in ours. Salt. Because my butter is unsalted. Not too much of that. Okay. You guys see how we doing? Recording? Good to go. Okay. Let's drop the turkey in there. And the egg. Okay. Let's mix this part. Because once you put the cream in there, it's going to be difficult to separate everything. Oh, this goodness. All right. So you put all the loose stuff in there. Get that. All right. Put the rice in there. Oh, there you go. Cold a little bit. All right. Let me mix this up. We'll be back. All right. Guys, pre-heat your oven at 350. Okay. Now that I mix all this, I thought we're going to drop the cream of chicken soup in there. Sorry I'm left-handed and then I'm blocking you. I'm going to be here. Okay. Let me do this. Now I don't usually measure, but I'm going to say about a teaspoon. Okay. There we go. Let me saw that. We're not done yet. Well, kind of sort of. But this is your casserole right here. And add as much salt and pepper that, you know, your family. You're a little hearted in layers. That's so pretty good. I like the fastest video. I've never made. All right. I think that's good. Okay. Can you see that? Okay. Spray that with some non-stick spray. Okay. Drop that in there. Without making a mess, hopefully. I know I'm blocking. I got it and left-handed. Just so it happens. Okay. There we go. Spray that in there. Okay. What? Investor debt? Okay. So, importantly, the Eric's store brand works. Is that over the top? You got your oven at 350, right? Good job. This is how you cover the top. You know she can. It's so good. There. This is where the butter comes in. Oh, shut the front door. Yep. I put that in the oven for 30 minutes at 350. We'll be back. All right. So, it was in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. And it's done. And it's for getting hot. I'm going to make a mess first. Oh my god. Honestly. I think I put too much cornflakes. But that's the best part actually. You know the coating on top, like macaron cheese does. Oh, it smells so good. You guys, you have to try this. It's so simple but so good. Okay. Cornflakes. Like that. And what you think? Bye.
