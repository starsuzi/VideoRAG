 Alright, going to shake kind of like a little homemade metal brake that we're just going to use for our roofing for the picking that roof up there. The metal we got is real flat from the store we bought it from so we're going to have more of a handle tool we already done those two. It's pretty much done this but I was going to show you how it works. All we done, we've got this is 10 foot pieces sheet metal. We had a used 2x8 because this is all we had and this bottom hinge down here is a 10 foot. We didn't have one 10 foot that was it but the way it works is we just took some right by door hinges, the one here, one on the middle, one on the end, took some screws and we're going to try to get as flush as you can. Here, you get a flush as you can on this other 2x4 here. And then we use these little pieces of 2x4 for our handles. And then we went down through here with screws with washers that way we can't rip it back out. And then we put two on that again, we had to put one screw in the middle to hold it down so you're only going to have one hole in your piece of sheet metal but we can fix that hole no problem. And then one on the two down here on the sand. And the way it works, the one's flat, one person is the land end and I'm having to get these two handles right here. You just start pulling it up. Let me get this pretty flat. That's as much as the angle we want but you can take this piece of wood here and move it closer to the edge or however you got to do it to get your metal to bend more. Or you can take another piece of wood on top of that like that. And it'll make it even a tighter up against there like that. But that's how you can make one work. You'll have a good one.
