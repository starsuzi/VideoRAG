 Hey guys, so I'm drinking the gold lightly. It's the plain, I guess. I have it in this little cup. I put the duct tape on it. Top is where it needs to be. And I drink the whole cup surprisingly and it wasn't bad. Well I have a little bit left because I'm going to show you my expression when I do it. But I kind of just hold my nose and I drink it but I probably don't even have to. Let me see. Let's see if I can do this sticky one but not this. Okay, let's do it. Take a sip of this and swirl it around. No problem. A little bit of an aftertaste but it's really cold so it's hard to drink in a full gulp. But I think I can do this. It's bearable. This helps so much. Use it. Trust me. Plug your nose and do not breathe. It's like it through do not breathe. It really doesn't taste like anything. It's not even that salty. But I guess with it being cold it's not bad. I will let you know how I'm doing in the next video and tell you how drinking all of this went. Wish me luck with the whole jug. So guess I'm going to be drinking this next 15 minutes but it's not that bad. It's a plain one. So if you guys use a plain one, it's probably better. Everybody says flour pack is your nasty. I guess it just increases the nastyness. This you really can't taste so. Datorade. Limit lime. 100%. Swirl it around. Keep a little bit in your mouth while you're drinking it down. It just tastes like a Datorade. So everybody out there going to drink it lightly. It's really not bad. It's just a lot. So I think that's going to be the only bad part. But the taste is bearable. See what I'm all done drinking this crap. Bye.
