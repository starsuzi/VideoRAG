 The digital rectal exam for prostate cancer is among the least favorite of all medical exams. Happily, it may be on the way out because other tests are more accurate in detecting the disease. According to UPI, a large review of medical data by researchers at Wake Forest University found digital rectal exams gave false positives and often turned men off to any type of test for prostate cancer. Digital rectal exams have long been a standard method for prostate cancer testing. However, an enlarged prostate does not necessarily indicate cancer or a requirement for more testing. Urologist and researcher Dr. Ryan Trelecki said, the evidence suggests that in most cases it is time to abandon the digital rectal exam. He added, our findings will likely be welcomed by patients and doctors alike.
