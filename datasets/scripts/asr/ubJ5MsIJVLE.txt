 Hey, it's Brandy from Just Ed's Sugar and I'm going to show you how easy it is to flambé. Flambéing is when you light your dish on fire with alcohol. It creates this really cool flame that's going to impress your guests. You do it when you make bananas foster or crepes, who's that, when you want to get that nice caramel sauce with alcohol. So keep watching to learn how. All right, so this is the fun part. This is when your guests are going to be so impressed. So listen for those evenas. Have a fire extinguisher close by just in case you never know what happens. So you're going to pour your rum over your dessert and then immediately light it. Ready? You're like, ah, look how great that is. Look at those flames. The blue and the red. Oh, so what this is doing is the alcohol is burning off just leading behind that spicy rum mixture. So it's going to caramelize the sauce. Isn't that so cool? That's how easy it is. Your guests are going to be so impressed. Now watch the full video of bananas foster to see the entire process and don't forget to like this video and subscribe to Pop Star Girl's Guide. I'll see you next time. Bye.
