 Alright, this is the nostalgia, three tier, I don't know exactly the model, but this is the show. This thing comes apart really easy. You just got the pieces, the snap apart, just like so. This, and there you're picking, and this comes off. So it is very, very easy to put together. You know, just looking at the reviews, there were some that were more or less saying the saying is horrible and don't get it. And some people said it was great. We plugged it in last night. It worked really, really well. What kind of chocolate did you use? Just, no chocolate, Nestle morsels. Okay, and then oil. We'll show that a little bit later and show which ones. Some people talk about it being loud. I mean, you just, you hear that running, but then when the chocolate's in there, we'll run it a little bit later. So that you can hear how it runs. But we ran it last night. Very, very, very pleased. You know, this thing is not like that right there. This is, this kind of this little thin covering that goes around. I mean, this is not a high dollar piece of equipment. But for 50 bucks and being able to run the chocolate through there, we had no problems. Again, we use basic chocolate and we'll show that running a little bit later. Okay, so we have, now how much chocolate, how much chocolate did you use and how much oil did you put next with it? Then this is 24 ounces of chocolate and three scoops. Three scoops and this is just normal oil, I mean normal chocolate, right? Yes. All right. Is there any heat already? So you heated it up in the microwave to kind of go ahead and melt it, right? Yes. So you were not hitting it. All right. And then you went ahead and turned the heat on. Yes. Okay, I'm going to turn it over. Okay. Feeling much faster. Eight and a half minutes which will save already, okay? you
