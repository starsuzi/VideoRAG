 Hi guys, you guys requested more DIYs to make pranks. I know that April's full day is just around the corner. I think this is the perfect opportunity to make some fake poop for pranks. This is a collab with my friend Timothy Meadow. We decided to make some nasty and disgusting DIYs. So he's going to be doing this gel of pimple. So make sure to check his video, the link will be down below. This fake poop is super easy to make and is way less expensive than the ones you can find in that stores. For this you will need hair conditioner. I use half a cup but this only depends on the amount of fake poop you want to make. Next to make it brown, add any kind of brown paint of your choice. I tried it with regular food coloring and it doesn't work. So make sure to use paint. Next we are going to need cornstarch. Keep adding the cornstarch to the hair conditioner until you see that the consistency is kinda like play though. This is completely optional but if you want to make the poop to have more dimension, add a little bit of cocoa powder and mix with your hands. You will see how this fake poop now has more shade of brown and it looks more realistic. Plus it smells like cocoa. Need this clay like regular play though and create a shape you want the fake poop to be and that's it. Super easy to make right. I really hope you like this video. Please subscribe if you aren't already and I will see you in my next video. Bye.
