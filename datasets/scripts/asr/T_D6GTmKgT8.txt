 Hey there it's Margaret from Days Wellsment. In today's video we're going to cover how to harvest rosemary. Rosemary grows year-round here in Texas. You want to make sure that you harvest it before it blooms and you want to try to avoid taking too much from one stalk. So what I like to do is just clip several stems in different places and I like to get as close down to this part where it comes off of the main stalk as I can. Now rosemary is very woody, more like a bush or a shrub than it is a plant. So you want to make sure that whatever you're clipping it with are good and sharp. We're going to go in, we're going to clip really close to here. And I like to get enough to fill the dehydrator. Whenever I'm drying herbs I don't like to mix trays in the dehydrator. I've done it before and they tend to take on the scent of the most pungent or the strongest herb. One thing to keep in mind is rosemary does bruise easily so you want to make sure that you are handling your plant carefully. And if you don't like the scent of rosemary you can't imagine somebody not liking it but if you don't be sure to wear gloves while you're harvesting your rosemary or if you're sensitive to rosemary oil because it will release as you're working with the rosemary plant. Once you're finished harvesting your rosemary it's time to take it in and clean it. Now you do want to wait to clean it until you're ready to use it. If you have any questions about how to choose your rosemary for harvesting or how to harvest it let me know and I'm happy to help.
