 Spiders like to come inside and I like spiders. I just don't like them in my house. I have a three-year-old grandson who is currently obsessed with vanquishing monsters. He would regularly bring me my weapon. This is my monster killer. Hi, I'm Molly. I work in accounting and we're going to talk today about the rescue spider traps. One of the things that's nice about the spider traps is they come ready to go. You just take them out and it comes in a three-pack and so you take one out and you can see that they are made of hard-molded plastic. The color of the plastic makes it dark inside which is what spiders like. And inside there are little tiny dots of glue so it's not just a blanket of glue. It's just little dots of glue. Because of the glue pattern they don't bunch up at the opening and there's holes on the side so there's kind of lots of entry points. One of the things I love about these traps is you can put them wherever you see spider traffic and they will go in because it's dark and close. Behind furniture, the kids baseboards and windows, sills, and the basement in our laundry room. What I like about them too is that when the layer gets full of lint or dust and plenty of spiders you can just flip them over and it doubles the life of the product. I'm an accountant and I like numbers. I wish I could put a number to how many they can hold but I know it's a lot. We are your typical bean counters. We love numbers and we love spreadsheets. I'm proud that we make this product in the United States supporting local economy as well as the rest of the rescue family. I enjoy using the rescue spider traps in my own home and I hope you enjoy a monster-free home-like idea.
