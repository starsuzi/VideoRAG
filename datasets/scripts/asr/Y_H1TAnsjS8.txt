 Hello, I'm Camilia, welcome back to culinarywishes.com. Today we are going to make homemade sweet Italian sausages. For this recipe we are going to use 1 kilo of minced beef meat and 1 kilo of minced pork, 1 head of garlic, 2 pork bones from which we are going to make some stock, pork casings, 1 bunch of fresh parsley, 1 spoon of vinegar, 20 grams of fennel, 35 grams of sugar, 4 grams of ground nutmeg, 6 grams of white pepper and 40 grams of salt. First of all, I'm going to make some stock and going to boil the pork bones in some water. Well, the stock boils, I'm going to put in this larger bowl, the meat and the spices. Now, I'm going to finely chop the parsley and the garlic. I've added all my spices over the meat and I'm going to mix everything very well and add 250ml of stock. I finished mixing the meat with the spices. I taste to be sure that it has all the spices which I suggest you do the same. And now I'm going to start speeding our sausages. First of all, I have to blow some air into the casings to make sure they don't have any holes and that they roll perfectly on the tube of the meat grinder. I'm going to add some salt and pepper to make sure that the meat is cooked. I'm going to add some salt and pepper to make sure that the meat is cooked.
