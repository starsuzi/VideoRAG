 Hi, my name is Christina Gavinda with DomesticFolicity.com and today we're going to talk about how to hang Mason jar candles. Hanging Mason jar candles are really fun and attractive. They look really classy. For this project all you'll need are something to stabilize your candle, sand, or dried beans, a candle, and two pieces of wire, and then your Mason jar. To make your hanging candle you need to take your first piece of wire, put it into a circle, and then twist your wire together to secure it. We're going to make sure that this part is along the side of the candle. Press it down along the candle, along the bottom ridge that's raised up higher than the other ones. And then twist until you have a tab. And then on the other side do the exact same thing. Twist. Now your candle is secure. I'm going to take your second piece of wire and then just hook it on by twisting the wire on each end. So we're going to take the first one through the end and twist to secure. And then we're going to take the other end and put it through the other loop and twist it. Once you have both sides hooked on you can form your wire into the shape that you want it. If you just want it in a perfect U you can do that. I kind of like the idea of having it pointed a little bit and then it'll move around a little bit less from side to side too when you hang it. Next we're going to put our beans and our candle in the candle holder. You just need enough to stabilize it. Then I'm going to push the candle down into the beans, wiggling it around a little bit until it feels pretty secure. What a fun party decoration idea. You can hang this from trees on nails or even on garland. Thanks so much for watching. My name is Kristina and today we talked about hanging mason jar candles.
