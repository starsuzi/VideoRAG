 Kitty'sies are! Okay, okay, you know the plan, right is a Bella? Yes, we're going to go in there and throw that wad's balloon right at Males. Exactly, we're going to get her back for all the times she pranked us! Hey, Males, sorry to interrupt. Wrong tower. There aren't other towers, Lilliana. Sure there are! I thought we were in Paris! Yeah, Paris! And this was the... ...ifletower. Anyway, Males, you gotta go, bye! So it's Males' birthday and she doesn't have any guests. Whatsoever, except for Tim for the spider. That's awful, poor Males. But I've got a plan. Would you say about throwing Males a birthday party? I know we don't always get on, but I can't imagine how lonely it would be having a birthday party with no one there. You're right! I'm in! Brilliant! Now we've just got to convince Males to come to the party! But how? I've got it! Do you like it? I do! I do! I do! I do! I do! I do! I do! I do! I do! I do! I do! I do! I do! Do you like it? That was a lot of cake for the two of us, Timothy. Oh! Do you like it? It comes to our attention that you are brilliant at pranking princesses. So we'd like to give you a box of princess pranks for absolutely free! Simply come to 78 Zuzania Avenue to collect your free box, your sincerely, the Princess Pranking Society for experts at pranking princesses. I knew one day my talents would be recognised! What now? Now we wait! The P-Rex Surprise! This is my box of princess pranks. Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Males! Happy birthday to you! It's not my birthday. Wait, what? You were having a birthday party. And there was no one there. Yes, I had a party. The Timothy, my pet spider, won today. You think I'd have no one at my party. All the evil villains of Kitty's Zoos Land come to my parties. Hey you! Come on in! Evil snacks and drinks in the corner! Tuck in! Hey! Timothy's playing the tunes. Come on, get in and go on that dancefloor! Hey! Quick! They're going to play Pin the Tail on the Princess in five minutes! Yo! Wait till you see what flies out of the evil party bags. Well, this was a waste of time. Hello, looking for a Males. That would be me. Got box of Princess Pranks for you here. From the Princess Pranking Society for Experts at Pranking Prins. Cessies. I thought that was something you made up to get Males to come here. Me too. Not again! Behold my new invention. But that's just a die. It's already been invented. This isn't just any die. It's a giant dad die. Look! Ooh! Juggle five surprise eggs. Seems easy enough. Hey guys. Hey, your turn. Great. Here goes. Ooh, three. Eat three carrot sticks. At least it's not broccoli. Ooh, pretty good actually. Okay, my turn again. Eat two pieces of raw broccoli. Oh! Maybe we should play a different game. Okay, let's play Lillianna Eat the Broccoli. Fine. I like this game. What game? Giant Diders. It's great. Wait, Males, what are you doing here? I'm trying this new thing called evil size. It's meant to increase your evilness. Wanna play, Males? Why not? Hey Olivia, one compliment. Nope, sorry. Hey, what's going on? Oh yeah, the die is magical. So if you don't do the dare, you have to do six more. Fine, I'll do your stupid compliment. Olivia, you're... Oh, Olivia! Yeah, wait, guys, wait for me. Fine, just give me the other dazs. There, I don't know the dazs. Now I'm out of here. Hey, what's going on? Oh yeah, I lied about the six-day thing, so you have to compliment Olivia. Fine. Olivia, you... Yes, Males. I just can't do it. Okay, I just have to cut the black wire without cutting the red one and my creation should be ready. Hey, you know what you're doing? Oh, you're building something for the talent contest. Yep, it's the smoke machine. I bet it's smoke machine. What makes you say that, Esme? Well, it's smoking a lot now. It's a smoke machine. Well, I can't tell you. It's a surprise for the talent contest tonight. What's your talent, Esme? I can't decide between holding a hand stud for ten minutes or eating ten whole types of parrhovers in ten seconds. Is either actually possible? Daaah. Well, what are the others doing? Well, Olivia and Isabella are doing some kind of joint talent. They're planning some kind of dazs, I think. Olivia, Olivia, this isn't working. Isabella, we're redefining dance, the fusion of ballet and umpah, balloon par. Yes, I know what you said. It's going to be the next ballet or umpah or bigger than both combined. Exactly. Now, come on. 5, 6, 7, 8. What about Malleys? Is she entering the competition? Yes, she said she's got a talent. We won't see coming. Let's hope it's better than last year. Yeah, paintings are always a lot more impressive when you don't use invisible paints. Yeah, I wonder what she is doing this year. Hi. It's no good, Timothy. If they didn't like my invisible painting, they'll never like my book written in invisible ink. Oh, Timothy, what am I going to do? Timothy, you're right. I can show you my st- Timothy, Timothy. Where are you? If this can walk on spiders, then it can walk on me. Oh, it would help if you could see me, would it fit? So now you can see me, but the princesses won't have a clue. Time to be covered at this talent show. What? It won't stop smoking. It's a smoke machine, I'm telling you.
