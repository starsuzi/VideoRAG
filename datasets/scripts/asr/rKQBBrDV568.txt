 So today we're going to be talking about flower presses. Their purpose, how to use them, how to make them, also is that good stuff. Now there are some commercial flower presses out there that you can buy. But basically all you need to do is you need to have some form of pressure to take a regular leaf or flower and flatten it out. Press the moisture out of it that's going to preserve the color and help you later laminated or put it in a protective sleeve. However you want to keep it after that point. Now you can easily make a flower press out of two pieces of plywood, some bolts and wing nuts to press them down and then have pieces of cardboard and paper towel. And basically you're going to be able to flatten out your pieces. And this helps to preserve them as I said and maintain their color, all that good stuff. So you can easily make one of those. However if you don't want to take the time or you've only got a few that you need to press, you can easily also make one out of some books and paper towels. What you're going to need to do is you're going to need to take a book, lay down a paper towel, then you're going to take whatever you want to flatten out, put it on there. And sometimes you get a couple in the same piece. And you're going to take another paper towel, lay it out on top. And I take another textbook and lay it on top. And basically you just continue to do that, creating your layers for your press. Now when you're all done with a simple textbook press like this, the ones on the bottom, that first layer, they're going to be getting plenty of pressure from all top books. However this top layer here is not getting the same amount of pressure so if you have just a couple extra books, just lay those on top and that will make sure that that very top layer also gets pressed down well. You can basically feel if they won't press down anymore that you've got a good press go.
