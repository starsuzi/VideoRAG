 So this is the process for storing fiddle heads. We freeze all of our fiddle heads that we don't eat right away and we eat them all winter. So first step after you blown all the sheaths off is to soak them in a bit of water just to get out any sand or dirt. The ones you pick aren't too dirty but if you're in a really sandy spot you probably need to rinse them several times to get out of the sand. The next step is to bring a big pot of water to a boil and to blanch the fiddle heads in and then wait till it comes back to a boil, stir them around a little bit and they turn this little bit different color green. That means they're ready to go. So those ones are about ready. Turn them off. And then what I'll do is I will use my strainer spoon and just fish out the fiddle heads and put them in a colander and let them drain. And then the next step after that is to bag them up into the size portions that you need. So I always bag them into two person portions about like that. And then it's important to label them and date them. So once you get a freezer full of green foods you know which ones fiddle heads and which ones kale and which ones daily lines. And that's the basic process.
