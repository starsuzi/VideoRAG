 Wait, don't throw that cracked cake away. We can save it. Let me show you how. Try to keep as much of the cracked or separated pieces of cake in their original places. Use frosting, icing or whipped cream to join it back together. Just spread or squeeze a generous amount of icing along the crack and gently push the cracked cake back together. Let the cake cool in the refrigerator until the icing sets before frosting it completely. It's best if you use the cracked layer as the base if possible. If you feel the cake is cracked beyond repair, don't despair. You can turn that cake into bite-sized cake balls or a creative parfait. For the cake balls, just crumble the cake and mix it well with some frosting. Roll the dough into bite-sized balls and refrigerate until cold. Dip the cold cake balls in melted candy coating and place on a parchment lined baking sheet to set before serving. For a simple yet fancy parfait, crumble the cracked cake into bite-sized chunks. Place a few chunks in the bottom of a clear parfait glass, top with some fresh whipped cream and a few berries and repeat the layers. Case of the cracked cake solved.
