 A main dill in slicer is a really great utensil to use in the kitchen. It's really great if you're going to slice a bunch of things or if you want really thin slices. As you can see with this main dill in slicer here, I've got a blade that cuts through. I can also turn this blade around and I can use this side and that'll give me a different cut. You can also adjust the thickness of your blade underneath here by using a little turn knob. Every main dill in is different but it all really has the same function. With this particular mandolin, I can also add different attachments onto the mandolin in order to make different slices. This will give me a julienne slice and have a larger slice here. An also very important feature of a mandolin is you want to make sure that it's got some sort of handguard. The handguard will go directly onto the mandolin and over the fruit or vegetable. That way when you slice it, it protects your hand from getting sliced. One thing you want to be very careful of is these mandolins are very sharp. The razor blades are extremely sharp and you always want to make sure you're protecting your hands. And that is a mandolin slicer.
