 Chowda is a great food for winter, it's really warm in and it's beautiful made with smoked addict. To make a chowda it's really really simple process, it's combination of delicious ingredients, sweat down some onions in some melted butter to get really glistening and soft. Then you're adding some whole milk, then adding some creme fresh, beautiful, add a little bit of shank, and a little bit of body. Then you're putting some fish stock, give you a great depth of flavour through the whole meal. Then you're adding the potatoes, roughly chopped, so don't need to be perfect, add a great bit of texture and body to the sauce. Then you add the classic ingredients, you have the sweet corns and the smoked addict. For a chowda, smoked addict has to be skinless and has to be burnless. Get this done by your fish munger or you can do it yourself. Simply score in the end of the fillet at the tail between the skin and the flesh, generally use the skin away from the flesh. To remove the bones, just feel through your hands, you'll feel a thin row of bones. Simply put your knife in one side, straight through the flesh, flick all the bones out. I always lay the fillet in hole, allows them to pouch gently. When you add the spinach at the end, all you have to do is stir it through and it helps break down the fish into beautiful big chunks. Smoked addict's chowda is fantastic, it's comfort food, it's warming, it's beautiful, it's just a piece of crusty bread.
