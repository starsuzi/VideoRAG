 You may have seen the two videos I put on earlier in the year making these insect hotel things. It's August now so a lot of the visits are over. It's you know things started to quite down a little bit so I thought I'd do a quick catch-up on how they've been and really successful is the answer. I've actually built a second one which I've put down the bottom half of the decking up here just filled it with a conglomeration loads of different materials from Cork to rope and cardboard and everything else in between and they have both been really successful. One thing I will say that that's been really obvious throughout the whole summer is that although they look nice aesthetically really really attractive to have in your garden if you're if you want to make something purely for wildlife and you're limited on resources and materials and manion time then I would say 90% of the visits to this have been into the the holes cut in the wood. I mean in this lower one I've put them into the into the the chopped wood here as well. The other bits I mean they get used from spiders and and and probably lots of other small of insects but almost all the the activity I've seen on both of these has been to the holes that are cut in the the edging so like if you want to make something good for wildlife and you're you're limited then I would just do that. I've much like the one up there that's always successful as is as are the other two here and you can see this year even though a lot of the holes have broken open now there are a lot that are sealed in for solitary bees. This has got four different hole types it's always been successful but in these new ones I've cut about ten different hole types ranging from two millimeters up to about 17 and I've seen so many different solitary bees and Ruby towel boss I've seen for the first time a lot of itch and monewops and flies which are parasitical almost like cuckoo you know insects as in they they lay their own larvae in the larvae of other bees and wasps beautiful examples of those and everything has almost always been around this edging so yeah you can you can do the middle I'm sure it's having a benefit but the the edging is where it's at I've said a lot of these have broken out I mean I've noticed some insects some bees tend to put the ceiling on the outside and some do it halfway down I don't know if there's method in that so that you know it's not seen easily from parasitical insects I mean this one's on the outside a lot of these this has changed throughout the summer but a lot of these are still sealed up here a lot of smaller ones the larger ones have seemed be broken open and they've gone now but a really successful over the summer so I you know like I say I would concentrate on getting an old lump of wood and drilling a load of holes in it if you want to benefit wildlife quickly and please I did them because they are they are pretty to have around so any questions please let me know thanks
