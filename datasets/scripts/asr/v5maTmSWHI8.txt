 Hi there, I'm Matt Kemp from London's the Underground Cookery School and today I'm going to show you some simple recipes which you're going to love. I'm going to show you how to make this perfect bread sauce. Now the first thing we need to do is put some flavour in our milk. So I'm just going to pour this into my pan. There we go. Now in advance what I've done is I've taken raw onion and I've just studded it with cloves so I'm going to put those in. Probably don't need as many as I've got here but I'm going to really get some that should probably do it. Get some flavours and bay leaves in there. I'm just going to put a little bit of nutmeg powder in and I'm going to stick that on my hob. Now what's going to happen is that's going to come up to the boil and we're then going to leave it to infuse for about an hour. That came up to the boil, we then let it rest for an hour and what I'm going to do is just pass all the ingredients into the conical sieve. Given what could have happened, not too bad. What I'm going to do now is these ingredients we don't need for this recipe. So I'm going to pour this back into the pan and I've got some obviously white bread because we're doing a white bread source but as you can see we've taken the crust off and the bread's quite stale as well. The very origins of this recipe hail from not wanting to waste anything. So I'm just going to break out little cubes of the bread in here. I'm going to put all of this in and once that's in we're just going to whizz it all up into a sauce. Right now that's nicely blended. We've got a nice texture. I mean all that can coat the back of the spoon and what we're going to do is put it over the hob, reduce it down a bit. We're going to add some double cream and a few knobs of unsalted butter. And there you have the perfect bread source.
