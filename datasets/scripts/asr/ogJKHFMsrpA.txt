 I'm going to show you today how to re-opulster a couch. The process isn't too difficult because an amateur like me can do it, but it does take a lot of patience and a lot of time to do. So if you're willing to put in the work for it, you can come out with a standing couch that costs about $100 to re-opulster. The first step in re-opulstering a couch is to take off the old material. I bought a couch from a second-hand store for only $10, but it had really great structures. So look for couches that are well built, even though they may be ugly in their current state. To take the material off of the couch, it takes a lot of effort. So, and it's hard on your hands. You're going to want to wear gloves. I used a hammer to pry up the woodwork. And I used a flathead screwdriver to pry up the tacks that are used in re-opulstering, and the pliers to pull out any tacks that were poking out. So if you have survived taking off the fabric from your couch, now it's time to start the upulstery. So, I'm going to use a flathead screwdriver to pry up the tacks that are used in re-opulstering.
