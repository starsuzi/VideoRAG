 Hi, I'm Jerry James Stone and you're watching Cooking Stone. And on today's show I'm going to make some garlic and rosemary roasted baby potatoes. I think you're going to like it. So to be honest we're going to add, I'm going to add just a little bit of olive oil to the bowl and I'm going to add my keeping tablespoon of rosemary. Now I'm going to add some garlic. You get all that in there, you get all these oils. So I do this first just with a little bit of oil and the rosemary and the garlic just so I can make sure that I start to get those oils a bit infused before I try to coat the potatoes. This I like, I want the flavor to be strong and so this is just a preference you don't have to do it this way. If you want it lighter then you can just toss the potatoes immediately. So let me go ahead and add in my potatoes and more olive oil. Just want enough to coat and then just kind of mix this all together. Now that our potatoes are tossed with the rosemary and the garlic we're just going to add it to this dish here, baking dish and roasted.
