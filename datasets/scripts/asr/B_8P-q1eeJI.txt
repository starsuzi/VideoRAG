 Hi, it's Alaska Granny. Do you like to use brown rice ever recipe that I use in the crock pot? So I had three cups of broth and then a can of the Mexicorn and just dump it all in. Don't drain it. I add a can of Diced Zesty mild green chili tomatoes and I don't drain those either. I like all the flavors of the juices Then I have a can of pinto beans and I do try to get low sodium items when I can because all Can food has lots and lots of salt and everybody gets way too much and then I never add extra salt A teaspoon of garlic powder. Oops Me more careful than that and a teaspoon of paprika and then a sprinkle of dry onions And I stir it all together I pour in the brown rice I put the lid on it and I cook it on high for three hours or more I'm back from playing outside all day and I'm so glad I loaded up my crock pot. There are two ways you can serve this delicious brown rice and pinto beans look at this how luscious and steamy this is you can scoop it right into a bowl and Top it with cheese or Use a slotted spoon so it isn't too runny and scoop it right onto a tortilla and Make a burrito So we're having a two ways People get choices around here if you had sour cream guacamole If it's not spicy enough for you add some hot sauce. I like it spicy just the way it is Okay, like roll this up Oopsy Look at that This one of these look good enough for dinner for you. They certainly do to me So try brown rice with pinto beans in your crock pot and Please subscribe to the Alaska Granny channel have a wonderful day
