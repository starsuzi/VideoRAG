 Psst, we have other channels. Everyone's mad here, home farm I guess. And I got a little catnip bush growing right here. And the key keys, they wanted. Do you want it? YEEE-YOU! Oh, you smell it! Oh, that smells so gAY! YEEE-YOU! Oh my gosh, dude. Oh, she got a piece. Come on, Duky! Come on, Duky! You want some? Yes, my kid's name the cat, Duky. He's more meek. He's a talker though. Come on, kiddies! Come on! Come on, Mom, Duky! Come on! Come on! You want some? Come on! No, you're over it. Come on, kiddies! Come on! Come on! Okay, well, I guess they're done. Mom, kiddie! There you go! Anyways, catnip's another cool thing that you can grow. I'm probably going to take it out of his bed, but this is kind of the pet bed. You can see in some of my other videos. Yeah, this is mostly for pets. We did put some cucumbers there though. My garden is just going crazy with growth. So, anyway, hopefully everybody else's gardens are growing great. Potatoes, I can't wait to eat those. Anyway, now we've got my chickens back here cleaning out the tortoise enclosure. They just pull all the bugs out. Anyway, God bless you guys. Have a good night. And yeah, grow some catnip. It's pretty cool. I wonder if dogs have something like catnip. Anyway, God bless you. And peace. Woo!
