 Welcome to tips and techniques at StartCooking.com. I'm Kathy Baster. When measuring ingredients, you'll need three basic pieces of equipment. A set of measuring spoons, dry measuring cups, and a liquid measuring cup. Measuring spoons range in size from one eighth teaspoon to one tablespoon. Oh, and three teaspoons equals one tablespoon. Dry measuring cups are graduated in size and are perfectly shaped for dip and sweet measuring. Dip a measuring cup into the dry ingredients and fill it to overflowing. Then, with the straight edge of a knife, sweep the blade across the cup to get an exact amount. Liquid measuring cups have a pour spout and a handle. The measurement markings are down from the rim, which helps to prevent spilling. There are eight fluid ounces per cup. To measure liquids accurately, leave the cup in the counter, bend down at eye level, and look at the measurements from the outside of the cup. In some countries, they measure by weight, not by volume, but we'll save that for another time. Cheers!
