 Hi guys, so the question I get asked most often is David Namm, what is the best way to enjoy breachy? And so I've made this video to make it a little bit easier for myself. Now the first thing you need to know about breaches, must must must be served room temperature. I don't want to get into the technical reasons why, but it essentially comes down to butter fat. The second thing you have to know and this is a common misconception is that yes you absolutely keep the rind on. It adds to the texture. That's not what the knife is for, you keep the rind on. Once you know that, you just gather the materials that you need. So what we have here is a cheese itself, of course. Some water crackers, just plain, nothing fancy. The cheese is the star of the show here. A lot of people like to eat the two together. I like to eat the water crackers after the cheese. That's just a little cracker, mate. And a knife, obviously. Now once you have all of this together, the first thing you do is pick up the knife and then to put that aside because that's dangerous, obviously, but we'll get to that soon. Then you just pick up the cheese and enjoy the cheese, relish the cheese. Really just save it like so. Yeah. I'm not old.
