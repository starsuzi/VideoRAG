 Hi, how are you doing Justin here? In this lesson today, or this video, it's not really a lesson I suppose, I want to talk about wobbly wing bars on or whammy bars on strapper casters because it's something that's bugged to me for I've mostly been a strapper player in my life and the whammy bars get a bit wobbly even if you can screw them all the way in and then it's kind of stiff and it's nice and tight and you've got good control with it but then it's kind of stuck down and if you keep pushing it down like that then the thread wears thin and then it doesn't sit here anymore and it's loose and I found it really frustrating. What I wanted was the bar to be loose like this but as soon as I do that now it's a little wobbly and I spent a couple of hours searching around the internet and didn't find an answer to this problem and then I tweeted it and a bunch of people all tweeted back the same thing which is something that will say I just get some ptfe tape man don't you know about it and I was like well no actually and it seems like quite a few other people don't know about it which is why I'm doing this video. Now if you go to your local hardware store you'll get this stuff called ptfe tape when I asked for it in my local place they didn't know what I was talking about and then I referred to it as plumbers tape and they right away knew what I was talking about and it's just this white I guess it comes in other colors too but it's like a really thin tape right and the solution is really simple let me go do a little close up so you can see exactly what I'm doing so here's the end of my wami bar and here's this ptfe tape very very thin stuff so all I'm going to do is just kind of wrap it around a few times around this thing and it doesn't even seem to matter that it's very well done or not you know I'm just been kind of mashing it up a bit and I've got about that much hurry and it's very thin easy to break and I'm just wrapping that around the wami bar here at the end the bit with the thread on it so I just kind of given it a bit of a wrap see I've tended to do a little bit thicker up this end and down here because I'm guessing that's where the wobble happens but you'll find now when I put that back in it's going to be nice and tight so literally now you just put the bar in and that's it there's no other trick just wrap a bit of tape on it and screw the bar in and that's it I've got it's really solid now it's exactly accurate the smallest little movement is reacting with the bar but I can push the bar down so it's out of the way bring it back up and it's fine so literally from there to there it's good and I've now got a proper proper good grip on my wami bar so any of you guys that have had that same problem hopefully a little bit of a PT FE tape will fix it see if you're not less than an or tip sometime real soon bye bye
