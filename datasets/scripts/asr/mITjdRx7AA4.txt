 Hi, my name is Scott Ayronson and I'm a private chef. Today we're going to discuss how to dice using a mandolin. Now you can exactly dice using mandolin, but what we're going to do is we're going to julienne and then we're going to use a knife to finish up the dice. I'm using a zucchini. You can use any vegetable you wish to dice. We're using a zucchini. I've locked off the ends, as you can see, and I'm going to go ahead and cut this in half. So I've got my zucchini cut down to size for my mandolin. Now I'm going to choose the blade for the julienne and I've chosen a quarter inch thickness here. I'm going to go ahead and enter this into my mandolin. And I'm going to put my zucchini onto my guard. And I'm going to use it in the normal fashion julienne. Now as you can see, we have very long juliennes here. Okay, so now what you want to do is you want to go from here with a chef's knife and dice up the zucchini or whichever vegetable you're using. And that is how you dice using a mandolin. Thanks for watching. Please don't forget to subscribe and check out our other great videos.
