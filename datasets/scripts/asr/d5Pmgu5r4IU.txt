 Hi, I'm Chef Kelly from Boardwalk Cupcakes. Today we're going to make a turkey cupcake. You're going to want to use a rose, tip, and get red buttercream, yellow buttercream and orange buttercream. Make sure when you're piping, the fat end of the tube is at the bottom. You're going to squeeze and just go back and forth around your cupcake all the way around. Then grab your orange and follow the same motions back and forth and then yellow. For the head, you're going to use chocolate buttercream with an open tube. And you're going to squeeze two circles, a smaller one, and a bigger one. You'll go back and use the rose tip again for the gobbler. You're just going to squeeze and pull and do the same motion for the nose with orange buttercream in a smaller bag. Your eyes just use white buttercream and pipe two circles. And you just chocolate buttercream for the eyeballs. And there you have it, your turkey cupcake.
