 Learn how to transform a basic piece of furniture into a stately buffet that's perfectly suited for entertaining. Start with a plain bookcase. Any color will do. Add interest overhead by dressing a plywood panel with pattern wallpaper and a striking sunburst mirror. Baskets placed in some of the cubbies function as portable drawers that can hold smaller items. A collection of pretty accessories adds personality to the tabletop. Bishes and bowls placed in the empty cubbies ensure dining essentials are always within easy reach. You can stack them however you please, since they'll be concealed behind the skirt. Fashion a skirt for the buffet out of a fabric that matches your decor. Any fabric will do. We used a curtain panel attached with large text to resemble nail head trim. Although buffets most often come in handy while you're entertaining, this piece is sure to add style to your home every day.
