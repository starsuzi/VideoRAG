 Hello, this is Clint with Auto Detail Doctor and today we're going to give you a brief demonstration of how we go about cleaning up poultry seats and a vehicle. This car is a sion car. Black poultry seats, this person we believe is how to baby seat or a child seat here. And you can tell on the edges there's lots of stains and stuff where it's been lots of spills. And so today we're going to we're going to shampoo it, steam clean it and extract it and we're going to show you how we go about doing that. So first we just spray a little bit of our shampoo on here on the seats. The carpet's down below it will also get the same process but just for this video we're just showing you the seats today. So we just put our shampoo down there. We use our vapor steamer. It has a brush head on it. It's simply used to agitate the surface and bring the dirt and grime and jump to the top of the surface that way when we extract mix it a lot easier and quicker. All we're doing here is agitating the surface and the next step is to extract. The temperature of the steam is 320 degrees. Next we're going to use our heated extractor and see what happens. And that's it. Sure makes a world of difference. And if you'd like to have your seats clean like that please give us a call. Thank you.
