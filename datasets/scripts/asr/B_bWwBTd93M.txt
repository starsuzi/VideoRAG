 Hey ladies, I'm here with this video because some of you One it will have a question on some of the nail decoration That I sell as well and some other nail decorations you guys get from eBay or in swaps that Basically what it is is that they bleed when you use them So what I have here is some decoration that I've received in my swaps and basically Here to show you that even though um They tend to bleed there is a way that you can use them that they won't bleed So let me go ahead and show you so why right here what I have are some mere circles and I know for a fact that those bleeds I have some blue stars and I have some gold and green sequins and I have some of these little Charlie things Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and show you Basically what it is is every time you use something that has alcohol in it or In this case here now solution they do tend to bleed and And that's just basically what it is. So what I'm gonna do right now is just put a little um Circle of acrylic and I'm gonna put the star right here as you can see it's starting to bleed So basically this is what you don't want to do you don't want to touch it and then put it there and then keep patting it so it'll stay No, once you put it there leave it there So make sure that you know where you want to put it And it's gonna stay there Okay, if you keep passing your brush over and over and over and over it's gonna bleed the color is gonna come out Okay, so as you can see right here My nail was white and it's turning yellow And then right here it's turning blue Okay, so Let me just clean this up a little bit So basically that's something that you do not want to do because like I said if you do it, it's going to bleed Let me show you what these red hearts are here Okay Okay, this one you will be able to see it better Okay, so what I'm gonna do is grab a little ball of acrylic Put it there again and then pick up this work this heart as you can see once Hopefully you can see There okay if I keep passing my brush The color is gonna come out It's gonna stay clear And it was red If I turn it around you can see the color Okay, basically you don't want that to happen So what I'm gonna show you is how to encapsulate it so that won't happen So let me grab another little ball of acrylic Put it in there. Okay, once you get your object you can either use the tweezers or your brush in this case I'm gonna use my brush because it's easier Okay, this is a side that I touched it. So what I'm gonna do is turn it around Okay, and I'm not gonna pat it anymore. I'm just gonna sit it wherever I want to Barely touch it leave it alone Okay, once you know that that's where you want to do it and don't move it back and forth because like I said It's gonna the paint is gonna come off It's gonna bleed Grab another little ball of acrylic Okay, and basically what you want to do now is just put it on top Push it and just leave it there Okay If you leave it there it's gonna dry and whatever it is that you encapsulated it's gonna stay with color If you go back and keep pushing it and pushing it and pushing it eventually the color is gonna come off and it's gonna bleed Okay, so in this case what I did was I left the little Pebble on top I Let it sink into the heart so it wouldn't bleed and then I pushed it in So now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you here Okay The same thing Grabbed it another heart set it there Okay I'm gonna grab a little bit of acrylic and put it there if I keep going like this And keep patting it as you can see the color is bleeding So that's what you don't want to do Okay So let me show you again, let me take this one off Okay, so let me show you you're gonna grab I'm not sure if you want Gonna grab your object you're gonna put it on top Okay You're gonna move it just a little bit and that's only from the tip so that way you know How much you want to move it around don't mind this because this was one the one previously that was bleeding And then what you want to do in order for it not to bleed anymore You're gonna grab another little ball of acrylic Okay, you're gonna put it in the middle and it's it you're gonna set it You're gonna leave it there maybe count one two Three then push it a little bit with your brush And that's it that's all you have to do once you do that Then you let it dry Okay And then you go on and you encapsulate your nail Okay, that's what's gonna prevent from your nail decoration from bleeding Okay, like I said the only thing you do is put your nail decoration you can do with your brush or with your treasors Leave it there Put a little ball of acrylic wait a couple of seconds push it and leave it alone If you keep brushing it you keep pushing it and moving it around and eventually it is going to bleed so Just give it some time like I said a couple of seconds and That's it your nail decoration will not bleed and you will be able to use Stuff that you bought me an eBay you bought with me or you bought You got in a swapped So if you guys have any other questions make sure to let me know and I'll answer them as soon as I hand and Yeah, so I'll see you guys with another radio.
