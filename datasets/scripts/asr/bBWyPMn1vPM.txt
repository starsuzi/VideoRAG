 Turnips are one of my favorite vegetables, especially these guys, Hakuri turnips. They might also be known as Tokyo turnips. They have a turnip on the end, yeah, but they also have greens and stems and a lot of times I kind of feel like people just clip off these greens and throw the the the tops and the stems away when I really think there's something to be said for eating the whole vegetable. So I'm going to show you how I like to clean them here and I mean this is just a matter of personal preference but trim that guy off there. So what I like to do is I like to take off the greens and then what I think is kind of special is that I save the stems and right now I've been running a dish at the restaurant that is turnips with its greens and stems. So I'll cut the greens up here and then I'll cut the stems maybe just on the bias. Then this turnip maybe he gets cut into quarters or sixths. So now I have the turnip, it's stem, it's greens. I'll saute these and brown them really lightly. Then I'll throw in the stems and then the greens at the last minute and you can enjoy the entire vegetable and not have any waste. Just kind of a cool way to enjoy the entire little turnip here.
