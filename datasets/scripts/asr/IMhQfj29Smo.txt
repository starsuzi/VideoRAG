 Hi, this is Yolanda Van Vien. And in this segment we're going to talk about how to grow or growing hollyhocks. Now hollyhocks are really a beautiful flower in your garden and they multiply and multiply and multiply. So there are one of those flowers that's great if you keep it under control. But if you have a large piece of property or a large flower bed and you don't keep up with your garden as well, it can take over. So when you grow hollyhocks, always use caution because they're a beautiful plant but they bring their cousins the next year. You gotta be kind of careful with them. Now hollyhocks can be started by seed. These are just little seed pods and you can just sprinkle them back down like as they nature would in the fall or save them and plant them in the spring and they'll just start new plants or they'll just start new shoots off of the mother plants and they need full hot sun and good drainage. That's the key. They're kind of a wild flower. They need lots of abuse. They want water but they want sandy, good composted, good drainage type of soil. They need heat. They won't do well in the shade. They'll get real spindly. And so you never want to give them too much shade or too much water even because they can rot too. Now I've had hollyhocks get 10 feet tall before. They're just gorgeous with great big, hibiscus red pink purple types of flowers all over them. And they can fall over when they get that tall if they're not getting enough sun. So sometimes you gotta stake them up or sometimes you can put them against a fence that works really well or I've just let them grow right with roses and other flowers that can keep them so that they stay horizontal. But they're easy plant to grow as long as you keep them in control, give them lots of water and room to grow.
