 Hey guys, I'm Chad Brown from Davio's Manhattan and I'm going to show you how to cut and clean leaks. Now leaks, kind of funny looking onions, right? But very, very dirty. So cleaning them very important. What we're going to do first is we're going to remove the green tops and I like to make kind of a V-shaped cut so that you don't lose any of the tender white on the inside. And after we remove the tops, you're going to remove the root end at the very base so that all you have left is this tender white section. In that area, you're going to cut it into quarters lengthwise so that all of the layers open up and release all of the dirt that's inside them. So you're going to have these long strips of white leak from here to here. Then you're going to cut across it into a dice. I don't like to cut it in half because you end up with like little fingernails and I think it looks kind of gross. But you're going to cut it into little squares straight across. All those squares you're going to gather together, you're going to put it into water and move it around really, really vigorously to get all the dirt to fall to the bottom. The leaks will actually stay up on the top of the water. Once you know they're clean, you're going to transfer it into a perforated container, let all the excess liquid drain out and you'll have yourself perfectly clean, perfectly cut leaks.
