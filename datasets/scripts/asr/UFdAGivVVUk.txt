 Today we're going to be carving some quartz otherwise known as rock crystal into a beautiful pendant like this in five easy steps. The tools that you'll be using for this are a fine-tipped pencil, a fine-tipped permanent marker, a ruler, a selection of carving tools such as a slitting disc and various other carving tools or diamond plated and of course the material that you'll be carving. Make sure when you choose your material it doesn't have too many cracks or inclusions which will later on damage your piece when it's finished. So now I'm going to saw up the quartz, make sure you use a sharp diamond saw blade and don't forget to wear your goggles and keep plenty of water on the stone and the saw blade. Now we're going to grind the piece of quartz that we've just saw on the grinding machine. The purpose of this is to get away the excess material and to get the shape of the quartz that you desire. Again remember to wear safety goggles at all times. Keep the grinding wheel wet when you're carving and keep your fingers out of the way. So now we're actually going to flute the quartz. Fluteing is curved grooves in a stone to make a pattern of any choice. After you've done it with the pencil you can go over it again with a pen which will make it much easier to see where you're going to carve. Next stage of the process is to actually carve the stone. You need a sharp slitting disc diamond plated and obviously your quartz. Make sure when you're carving you wear safety goggles at all times. Keep both the stone and your carving tool wet. It's reduces dust, keeps the stone cold and doesn't break the tool. Go along the lines that you've just marked out previously and try and keep a steady hand while you're doing it. And it will look something like this.
