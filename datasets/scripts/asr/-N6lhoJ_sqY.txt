 Hello, it's right here. Today is January 28, 2018 and yesterday I was doing the processing of the honey, at least spinning the honey out from all the frames from the dead-outs that we had gotten when we did our rotations and I had to come back up here today anyway to clean up. And I was thinking about it last night when I was editing that program for the video that I didn't show any of the honey in the buckets, what it looked like after the wax rose up, what I needed to get it from that point into into our bottle and then for the bottle or into our bottles. So I decided to make a video on that part today. If you kind of like follow up from that video I did last week. So as you see for me I've got the three tons of honey that we spun out of our extractor yesterday. I'm grabbing camera right now and I'm going to show you what the honey looks like after a day after. It's still with all the wax floated up and all the little dead bees that were in it floated up at the top and what I do to get all that removed all that stuff and then actually put it into the bottle. So grab the camera, we put it over here and show you what we got in these buckets right here. So here we come with that big reveal and as I take the covers off I can already smell the honey smell coming up. This is what we're looking at. Now you're not going to say that that's a really beautiful looking thing and it really is. It's kind of like nasty because as you can see there's some you know bee parts in there or bee bodies kind of look like like oatmeal or something like that. And as we look at our second one you see it's about the same status oatmeal looking, bee parts and a lot of wax and looking at it you would think that wax is probably like too much as thick but in reality it may only be about half inch thick. It's not a really heavy coat of wax. So what happens the wax as the honey is settling the wax being lighter than honey will rise to the surface and so generally after 24 hours all the wax that's in the honey has risen up to the top. And what I do is simply skim that wax off and put it in the tray and I'm going to feed that to the bees and then what residual wax is still left as I pour this honey into my supers into my bottom tank then the rest of the wax particles will be caught in the double filter. So this is the second bucket right here. Let me show you the third bucket. And this is that third bucket and it has a lot less wax particles in it still has a few bee parts in it. This one I probably won't even be skimming off because it's so little the honey is just right underneath that. So let me grab my spoon, my tray and show you how I skim this stuff off. So what I'm going to do is use my real handy dandy spoon right here and that's just going to I'm going to go inside the bucket and I'm going to pull the capins off the top of the honey then as I come up and I'm going to use my spatula and I'm going to scrape it into the pan right here and like I said before I'm just going to take this pan after I've got all the capins on it and I'm just going to bring it outside and let the bees take care of it. So when we're up the camera get it real close let you watch how I do this thing and put it onto the tray. and now it's all cleaned up. All three buckets I went and skimed that square bucket too right down your bucket also but you can see a big difference between what it was and what it is and now you can really see our honey very very nicely. All right so at this point right now we're going to go ahead and start dumping our honey into our bottle and I also want to show the wax that we pulled out of there in our pan this is just going to go outside for the bees to start eating on I'll tell you what looking at right now it looks like it's ready to go in the oven about 350 for about 40 minutes and we'd have some nice oatmeal cookies but I don't think you would taste like that my taste like honey but not cookies. Now before I start talking about the bottle right here I want to tell you about this little spoon that I use and I'm sure that when I first show this spoon you say when we stand you know that spoon is kind of broken and I actually broke this on purpose because the handle was about this long and you really need a short handle spoon to be able to get inside that bucket to get that wax out so this is my special spoon that I use to dip in the wax out of my bottles. All right so I'm going to talk about the bottle right here and I've been here with this bottle it's a maximum 16 gallon heated bottle with a no drip stainless steel drip on it and I'll tell you this is a great great tool they are a little bit pricey but it's well worth it and it beats the heck out of use in your plastic tub with a plastic gate on because the honey is inside here and there's a jacket of water around this bottle and so it can heat up your honey I heated up to about 100 degrees or maybe about 105 degrees and it's so when you when you push down on the handle the the honey that comes out is just like water so thin because it's heated up it's really really nice I really love this this bottle and I keep it on this little jacket platform because when I bottle I just pull a chair up and I'm like I sit down a lot I pull a chair up and I just start bottling and you can you can use this a lever and it'll actually jack the whole platform up talking to Justin to the height that I want when my chair is so what I do for the this next point is my honey is already in my buckets and I'm ready to pour it into my bottle because that's all the processing that we do to it we just remove the wax and we run it through a two-stage filter and so this is the little two-stage filter that I use you know was a course and then was a fun and this just goes right on the top of our our tank right here but it doesn't fit in there so you know I have to make adjustments and my my adjustments well like wood you know wood I like wood so I can piece some strips of wood in there to stem this out and set my string right in there now I'm ready I'm ready to actually start pouring our honey into into our bucket into our bottle so I'm going to go in and grab our bucket and now we'll do the the first first one now because I don't know six twenty eight dirt rooster and I can't bench press 350 pounds you know I like to stay staying the range of about five pounds so when I feel these buckets up if I fill up these seven gallon buckets with honey they're gonna they're gonna be way enclosed to nine hundred a hundred pounds so I don't really feel like half the way because I can I can't pick it up and press it in here don't get into it I shouldn't say so this one is even a lighter one so I'm gonna start with this and that way if I'm making a mistake I will look too bad on the video so let me dump this in there so I'm gonna fill it up so I'm gonna and all I do is dump the honey into my string and you can't you don't want to overfill this thing you're gonna have to let it catch up and you can see how it's running really thin so this honey is it should it should go right through here pretty quick now it's hitting the bottom of the bucket I can hear dripping in there this is running really nice just and I'm just about full of something you let it catch up even though it's honey and I can see this honey has got some crystals in it but that's actually okay because I'm gonna when I leave here this evening I'm gonna turn on the heater this thing and get this honey heated up and it will just decrystallize all those things right there but you can see the little crystals in this one I think you're gonna watch me do this no I think that's good that's really good I let me get my spatula I'm gonna scrape this stuff out all right that's an empty bucket bees can have a rest well as I always get expected when you when you're doing anything with bees and what happened here was this honey like I said earlier I saw the crystals in there was so much crystalized honey in there that I was recording here it just clogged the filter up so what I'm gonna do is is I'm and I strain that that hard out but I still got that other bucket to do swill I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run over the shop right now and and heat that bucket up and decrystallize it just so it'll strain through here so much easier so I'll be back well like Orange says it ought to be back so I've been upstairs here for about oh it's been about an hour and 15 minutes now and all I've done is take my pot and put my big bucket in it filled with water and start starting to boil it and I constantly I check and stir the honey so it's not too uh let it get too hot in one spot so that the heat goes all the way through it so I stir it constantly these are nice pieces of cypress wood for that and uh and then I check it and I look on the stick and there are no more crystals well there's one two three of them I see right now and then the other thing I do is I check the temperature because I can feel on the outside the bucket's warm I mean that's boiling but the bucket is warm but then I know the heat of the honey by just running it on my finger it's probably about 80 degrees because I can feel it and I can taste it too so it's done turn it off when I grab this thing head back to the honey hut and we're going to filter this and get it into the um um five that's at the bottom all right we'll pick it up back in the uh and it's got me joking we're going to pick this up back in the honey well I just caught a break one of the monks here and the Brian he uh he had seen me walk into the shop it's about a block from honey hut to the shop and he's seen me walk into the shop uh Karen had bucket of honey and that part of the honey's got to weigh 50 60 pounds and he said to me he said, Jeff, we don't carry that bucket you try to be like the dirt rooster and character you go, I like wait I see you know the dirt rooster is and he's like something is jam I said that's ridiculous I'm mumbling something to a guy who does b videos but anyway brother Brian did actually get me the cart and uh and I used it to bring it back so we got it right here it's already go and I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how easy this stuff pours in once it's it's uh it's uh thinned out you know we heated up let me grab the camera and I'm going to show the camera as I pour this into here just the inside all right here we go and I'll just run right through there and it'll catch all of our cappings and whatever wax is in there yeah that was very nice and there you have all the honey in the baller now there's still a little bit of that fine wax on the surface of the honey but other than that that is all filtered and ready to bottle and that's what we're going to pick this thing up tomorrow we're going to plug it in right now set it for about a hundred degrees and let it heat up overnight and tomorrow we'll bottle it up so we'll pick this up tomorrow it's Monday morning now it's about about 10 o'clock in the morning and uh got back out into the honey hut to to bottle up the honey um and uh so again I'm gonna set up like I said I use I use the little jack up platform and um I put the uh the bottle of the right where it's really easy for me convening for me to do that I've got actually what I'm doing today is um I've got to fill up these little lay-downs bottles we have we have the Abbots coming to visit us only it's like 35 Abbots coming from all the country and so they're all going to get a little bottle of of our honey in their little ditty bags so I've got a bottle this up and then our alcoholic bottle of another 40 or so bottles and just the some reserved in the tank before I do that let me I want to I want to show you the honey in the tank and I want to show you the temperature of what the honey um is inside right now I remember I told you that this is a heated um tank and you can tell that we've got the temperature right at about 105 degrees is where it's sitting at right now and it's controlled by a uh a little thermostat on the side right there uh and it's it'll keep the honey at that temperature and what it does is it heats up the water that's on the inside of the tank in fact you can see here's here's the level of the water inside of our tank this whole little observation tube right here it tells you how much water is inside of your tank and uh let me show you what's on the inside of that tank is where you actually fill the water um to put inside of that jacket and here's our honey inside oh man that smells good yeah so there's a little bit of foam on the top just a really fine particles of wax and what happens as the as a level of the honey drops that little bit of wax will actually adhere to the side of the of the uh walls of this dispenser and uh so you get some of it will come in there but not a lot not a lot anyway usually give those uh bottles of honey away anyway they got a little foam in them all right so let's bottle up some honey so I'm going to go ahead and uh pour out our first bottle of it where are our bottle and uh put it underneath that dispenser push our lever down and look how fast that honey comes out and there you are having money right there man that is pretty pretty stuff so it's been two days since I've been out here but I've got all the uh the labels on the the bottles the ones that we're going to give to the avid and the ones where actually going to be selling um I wound up not only bottle of 48 of these no 52 of these bottles and I probably still have another two more gallons um in the bottle so we still have pretty good on that like I said it was probably about eight gallons of honey but uh so this this is the end product so they've actually come and picked up the little ones that were given to the avid's on this weekend and I'm actually going to go right now and deliver 48 of these things to the business office because I'll have a lady over there they they wanted some honey too so I'll have one of this one um you know the process of actually getting it from my bottle uh into the bottles put now the labels on it and show you how to park but it's just putting labels on but it's still a process and we got we got all this done so beautiful honey girls did a really good job uh unfortunately we didn't get to keep those girls but they will have by the grace of God will they have more bees to pick up and uh carry on so thanks for watching keep on watching I'll be making one God bless straight I'm out of here until the next video yeah I got you out of where this truck is I'll tell you something I guess I'm fine look okay so she didn't got a hole and I can't ever tell where you going baby I can't don't let me get you on the phone when I need you yeah I got you a life alert so you can hang your rain neck if you go down and you can't get nobody just hold that button right there so and then do that down 911 for me now it's got the GPS thing on it so you got to have like yeah uh good prostitutes Americans with the GPS on that one is there you go so when you fall out out here somewhere thank you Rooster you just hold the button and is it what it is the fish falter you want me to hurt myself and you just got to hold it down for a little bit before you black out I'm gonna face out right now that's a practice one thank you brother I'm never lost now
