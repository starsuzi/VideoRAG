 Hey everybody welcome back to my channel it's a girl from a heart and they have the website called Faria Me So in today's video I'm gonna show you how to make these beautiful mandasi They are very very soft I can say they're perfect Like you can see they got space in the middle and I did that on purpose So yes guys are very very soft like I said and very very delicious So if you want to see full detailed recipe then please feel free to click the link down in the description box That link is gonna take you straight to my website where you'll be able to see everything So in today's video you don't need much things you only need these things right here You need flour? Normally I use strong flour because it makes my mandasi perfect You also need cardamom powder sugar Yes you also need warm nutmeg Like you can see right there you need a ball where you're gonna mix everything So put everything in there flour and then sugar Cardamom powder Yes and mix everything together nicely Okay so now we're starting adding in the liquid Please make sure you add bit by bit you don't need to pour the whole coconut milk Otherwise you end up doing too much So when the dough is kind of sticky you're gonna add flour And if you place the dough is too thick then you're gonna add more coconut milk But for now this dough is kind of sticky so I'm adding flour until I get the right size The way I would like my mandas to be Otherwise if it's too sticky you can't work with it It's gonna be very very hard to roll it So now I'm gonna transfer the dough on the wet top And start kneading it nicely until the whole flour is proper mixed And it's like it's ready to work with it So this one right here is the right one It's not sticky and also it's not too thick If you can see on the wet top there's nothing there like sticking it or anything like that So that's how you want it to be We also need a tray where you're gonna put your mandasi So now divide your dough into equal size and you're gonna form little balls Like you can see they're gonna be about five of them Once you're finished you'll start rolling them So you'll be rolling bit by bit So we are starting with one Roll it nicely into a small round shape Not too small like that you can see And then cut it in the middle like that And also the other side So you're having four corners like you can see So now I'm gonna put that in our tray The one with spread flour before This is the one now it's right in the triangle shape So when you're gonna cook your mandasi you'll have nice shape All mandas should be stretched like that Until you finish everything Okay guys so look at my mandasi They are not too thick at the same time they're not too thin They're just in the middle but avoid too thick Otherwise your mandas are not gonna be the same as mine Put your mandasi somewhere where it's warm for about 30 minutes To 45 minutes it all depends with the weather And leave it there until they double in size So this is after they've doubled inside I'll start frying them I don't know if you can notice the difference But you'll see as we fry okay But have a bowl where you're gonna put your fried mandasi And make sure you have raw kitchen towel like that That's gonna help to suck all the excess oil you know So now put the oil in the pan and put it on the stove So they can get heat Before you start frying them shake the excess flour And then put them in the oil But that oil makes sure it's not very hot Otherwise it's gonna burn your mandas outside At the same time then they shouldn't be very cold Otherwise your mandas will suck all the oil So start frying them Splash oil all over the mandasi like so It's gonna help you know mandas to have cracks Keep on turning until you have the right color When you think you have with your color then take them out So these are my mandas I'm taking them out Oh for some reason this one do you wanna come out? Anyway yeah, finally I have money to take it out And put in your bowl like that Repeat the same process until you finish all mandas So this is mine guys I'll finish cooking them all and this is what you have So right now I'm gonna show you how it looks like in the inside This is it It looks too big but it's not that fat inside Can you see that space inside? This is how it should be You shouldn't be having too much dough inside like that That was the reason why we wrote our mandas very thin So this is up close So you can see nicely and they're so soft That tastes so good Very soft and very thin Not oily mandasi But also very very tasty From the outside they look nice and big but inside they're light That's how it should be Okay otherwise we end up having donuts So we don't want that yeah Anyway guys thanks for watching I hope you're gonna go ahead and try this recipe Like I said if you want to see four detailed recipes Please click the link down in the description box That link's gonna take you straight to my website If you don't want to miss any video from me Then please feel free to subscribe to my channel If you wanna catch up with me Then please feel free to follow me on other social networks Everywhere I'm using Fahaiyami If you want to see more dishes Then please feel free to visit my website is www.fahaiyami.com Please feel free to request any dish Whatever you want to see on this channel And also if you have an equation Please leave your comment down in the comment section One step is in your comment I'll get back to you as soon as possible Please don't forget to share this video anywhere It can be Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter And I hope you're gonna go ahead and try this recipe Thanks for watching guys I'll see you in my next video Thank you bye
