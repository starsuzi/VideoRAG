 Hi, I'm Katie and I write for a budgetary cooking blog and today I'm going to show you how to cook some fiddle heads So let's get started Things you're going to need for this exercise are fiddle heads I mean if you want you don't want to cook fiddle heads you don't cook fiddle with a large Mixing bowl because we're going to be soaking them in that a medium sized hot with a lid and Also any other things you might want to cook with afterwards like some olive oil, sea salt, love juice, whatever you want We're going to start by preparing the fiddle heads. This is a very important process Because if you look at fiddle heads They have these little brown golden bits on them and you want to make sure you clean that off Because that'll make you sick. It'll make you sick Don't drop them on the floor After the grid starts You want to start by clipping off the little golden ends or not. You make sure it looks good Pogged in to be washed out after this part takes a really long time So we're going to skip through that and in about two seconds, then we'll see you in the other video You Bam done. Did I make that look easy? Just now let's talk for a minute about the importance of cleaning fiddle heads Don't eat them wrong. It'll make you sick when cleaning them Like I said, you want to make sure you remove all the brown bits and also examine them very closely Because this one looks really green right looks pretty good But see right there you get some of the brown and then when you kind of peek through oh lots of brown in there So that's not a good one. We don't want you to stop I can't even feel that it looks something like this Don't even try it's so weird that you won't even be able to clean it properly So that's not a good one to use either Next in the cleaning process We want to soak them twice front and under water And set your timer for 10 minutes If 10 minutes seems like a long time to wait might be a good time to grab a cup of tea or maybe even a good book Like this one. This is a good book. It comes to be survival by camcouper Now they will unlock in demand press By now you've never seen them before you're probably wondering what that's a fiddle head fiddle head is the only part of the ostrich's fur It's a little tiny bit that coils up at the beginning before it unfolds and becomes a full firm They're very high in Any Austin so actually great and hard and blueberries pretty often in content It's also got fighting A, C, it's got magnesium potassium iron and also interestingly enough Omega-3 fatty acid so it's super good for you if you live in a place that harvest them They can also be found in the wild which makes them really cheap I got mine in the farmers market though because I'm lazy and they were more than 60 per pound So that's still pretty good So our 10 minutes left So what we're going to do is straight them And what are we going to do? We're going to strain them again because we want to make sure they're really clean We're in small for another 10 minutes Let's use five to open door Now that your fiddle heads are clean you're ready to cook them So tank them out of your strainer Then boil them in your pot Put some water in it Put a little bit of salt in it, let it boil Now that it's boiling we're going to drain it and boil it again If you look The water is a really warm color and that's okay So be very careful when you do this because it's very hot water And you also don't want to waste any of your little heads The water turns really girls brownish like black kind of color Which again is perfectly normal You want to boil them twice because if you don't you'll get sick I can't say enough if you don't spare your little heads properly They'll make you sick Also don't burn yourself Very important That's not really related to making fiddle heads but related to life in general So don't break yourself So we're boiling them again And we'll come back to that with it's done When she's boiled them all twice he can take them off the heat And also strain again be very careful once again not to burn yourself Hey there you go You've got a pot of fresh delicious little heads which go out with any meal Or it can become a centerpiece of their own meal What you do now with them is really up to you I'm just probably going to put a little bit of butter on them and see some bias If you want you can put them in a soup You can put some Have to you can do whatever you want They're very versatile vegetables They're very similar to a very good flavor but they're milder And they also got a little bit of a mild spinachy taste It's kind of like a mix Feel like green vegetables Your problem really likes them Enjoy This is pansy She would cook too if she had thumbs But alas she does not
