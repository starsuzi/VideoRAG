 Hi this is Yolanda Van Bean and in this segment we're going to talk about how to harvest and store sunflower seeds. Now sunflower seeds are really easy to grow. They grow from sunflower. So when you're starting your sunflower, make sure and start them after the last frost or early summer. But when the hottest sunny spot you can find and just give them lots of water, they'll grow and make beautiful plants. And by the late summer you'll find that you'll have big flower heads with lots of seeds on them. And you know that they're ready to harvest. If you take them and you barely tap on them on the seeds and they start pulling away from the plant. You don't want to actually pull them off. But if you barely tap them and they start dropping, then you know your sunflower is already to harvest. And so you want to dry them too. So I found it's easy to just throw that whole pod into a paper bag and let it dry real well or put it out in the sun and just tap all the seeds off of it. And so once the seeds are dry, you can storm right into paper bag or you can put them in plastic. You just have to be careful because if there's any moisture at all they'll go moldy. But probably the best way to store them of all is in glass. Because if you think about it whenever you buy sunflower seeds a lot of times in the jars that's when they're the freshest tasting. So the best way to store them is to dry them really well and put them in glass jars that are airtight. And then that way you can enjoy them all winter long.
