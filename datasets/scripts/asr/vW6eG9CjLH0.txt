 I'm going to show you the basics on maintaining the cloth on your pool table, basically with a billiard brush. What you want to do is bear down enough to get these bristles into the cloth. And you're achieving two things. Number one, you're cleaning the cloth, but you're also training the cloth to lay down in a uniform direction. Instead of all these random fuzzy fibers sitting up and playing games with the ball, you're training the cloth to lay down in a uniform straight direction. That'll trough up the table to ball a roll faster and straighter. And you're also obviously removing all the lint and the fuzzyness on the new cloth. And when you do this, you want to bear down and go in straight lines, start at one end of the table, and work your way down to the other end of the table in straight lines. And what's going to happen is you're going to remove the dust and lint, but you're also training the remaining fibers to lay in a uniform straight direction. So you don't even want to use the curvy or arm, because the felt will actually follow that pattern. So if you do that for the first couple of weeks, you'll train your felt, there'll be a day when you'll notice it'll play truer and faster. And you'll be good to go, and then it's just maintaining for dust after that. Quick and easy.
