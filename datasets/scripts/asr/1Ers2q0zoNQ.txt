 Cheesecakes have a tendency to be one of those scary foods that most people don't like to make. And one of the things you often see in a cheesecake recipe is a note that says cheesecakes won't break or won't crack or won't be as likely to crack if you use a water bath. And I think a lot that scares a lot of people because they think they need some special equipment. This is my water bath. A tea kettle and a roasting pan. And all you do is boil some water, make sure you wrap your cheesecake pan in foil so it doesn't leak in and just put boiling water in the roasting pan around the spring form that you're making your cheesecake in. Until it comes up, you know, just about half an inch or so. Basically what this does is it keeps moisture in the oven and that way the top of your cheesecake doesn't get dry. It isn't so likely to crack. And then you just bake it as per the recipe.
