 I'm bored. You want to do something? I am doing something. Go bother mom. I'll bet you a dollar this coin will lend on heads. Ha! Head! One dollar! Flip it again. Fine. I call heads again. Ha! Head! That's another dollar. Double or nothing? Fine. I call heads. It's heads. And since we're doing double or nothing, I believe you now owe me two more dollars. Hmm. What should I do with my four dollars? All right, flip it again. Double or nothing? That's another four dollars. Just flip it. Heads. Seriously? Again. Heads. Again. Heads. Again. Tails. Really? No, it's heads. You owe me sixty four dollars. You keep doubling it. It's not my fault. Oh, why is he what's going on here? I'm being hustled, aren't I? That's a trick quarter. Flip it again. This time I'm taking heads. It's tails. That's $128. I know what it is. Maybe we should stop. You already owe me more money than you make in a week. You're right. I just need to walk away. Or I need to vary my approach. Keep flipping it. Matt! Just do it. Heads. Tails. Tails. Heads. Heads. Tails. Tails. Heads. Tails. Tails. Heads. How much? $8192. Clearly, that strategy was flawed. Okay. Give me another coin. Matt. Just give it to me. We will both flip these until one of them lands on heads. It's bound to happen. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Fine. I now choose Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. This is the most statistically amazing thing I ever see. In case you're wondering, we're now at $536 million. $870,912. That's it. My life is over. This 2003 Special Edition Arkansas Quarter has ruined my life. I'm done. Let's work up a monthly payment plan. Why don't you try flipping it one more time? Why? I'll tell you why. Because if I guess wrong, I will owe you $1,073,741,824. We're really good at math. Right? No, come on. One more. I've got a feeling. I'm scared. Head's hurting us. Tails. Tails. It's sad. Come on, one more. It doesn't matter anymore. Don't you see my life has crumbled before my eyes. My children's children's children will be paying off this debt to your descendants for stintury. Head's hurting us. Head's hurting us. Head's hurting us. It's head. It's head. It's head. It's head. Oh, President Washington, your face is so masculine. Oh, I'm free. The air is sweeter. The colors are more vibrant. This pizza is still very old. Oh, I'm free. I'm free. Oh. Okay, $1. Head's your tails. I want to stay with you. I want to stay with you.
