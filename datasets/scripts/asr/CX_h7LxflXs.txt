 One of the problems people have when they use ice is that they take it off too early. Let me explain you how ice works. Once you apply the ice pack to the area that's hurting at about two or three minutes, sometimes people experience an aching soreness in the area. This is common, don't worry, it's a normal process. The blood vessels and the nerves are responding to the coldness, it's okay. It's going to last for about 40 seconds and then the area is going to be numb. You'll feel a lot better now. Leave it on for about 10 or 15 minutes and then take it off and leave it off for two hours. You can then safely reapply it and go through cold therapy again.
