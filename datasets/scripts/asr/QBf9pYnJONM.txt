 So you bought a new refrigerator, but now you've got to install the thing. Fortunately, it's not too hard, but there are some things you want to look out for. First, before you plug it in or put anything in it, it's a good idea to make sure that the fridge is nice and level with the floors in your home. You'll want to get a level out for this and actually measure inside of the fridge and not on a shelf if you can help it. Sometimes the shelves are angled in a certain way to help contain spills. If things are slanted to the left or to the right, you can just pop off the frame on the bottom of your fridge to reveal the two little knobs down there that'll let you level it. Just give them a turn to the right or to the left, depending on what you need, and you'll have things nice and level in no time. Maybe more important is to make sure that your fridge is properly leveled from front to back, and you don't really want it to be perfectly level per se. What you want is something that leans a little bit towards the back so that the door will close on its own if you ever leave it open. To do this, just grab your wrench and go back to those knobs at the bottom of your fridge and turn both of them the same number of times in the same direction to get it to tilt backwards just a little bit. Once you've done it right, the door should just gently close on its own. One last thing, if your fridge has a water dispenser or an ice maker, you're going to need to hook up the water line. To do this, just turn the water off at the source and then connect the fridge's water line to your water line. It helps to have two wrenches to do this so that you can get some tension on one end while you twist the other to get it nice and tight and prevent leaks.
