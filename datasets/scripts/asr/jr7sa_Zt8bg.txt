 Hi everybody this is Mark Richard over Pleasant Spellie Irish Farm. In our first video I showed you how to do the hybridizing crossing two breeds together and and this one here I'm gonna show you what happens after about two months that seed pod gets on there and you'll be able to see how I go ahead and break the seed pod apart and then plant them in these pods here. This one here this is what it looks like. If you could see that name there this one's dusky challenger cross pedigree so this is what it looks like after two months and I'll show you what the seed pods are. Now I pull these off, cut them off, look them off and I threw them in a drawer and dried them out. So this is two months growing on the plant and then you can see this here. You can see that the seed pod breaks open it's got three sections to it but they break open and that's why I put these little nylimes over them because they'll actually you put a nyline over it and then go ahead and wrap the twisty tie around it with the name tag on it and you'll be able to save any seeds to pop out of it because you see it blow up and come out of there and it'll go a little bit more but you break them apart. You get anywhere from 25 to 50 in each one so what you do with these is I've actually laid in some soil here and the soil is it's really good soil if you can see it I don't know how well you'd be able to see that but it's got sand in it it's got dirt it's got compost it's been well-composed it this is stuff that I actually got out of my garden that I've had there for a year you don't want anything that's clay-like you want it to all want it very loose soil what you do is you take this you sprinkle the seeds on here move around one type per planner just face them out a little bit it's not really that important though and I take another one and I just smash it down a little like that and then I'll take some more soil and I sprinkle it on the top you want about oh maybe three quarters of an inch you want too much on there but really think it's pretty hard you go come out and you take this and you know press it down not too hard just kind of get it down nice and tight and then that's it and what I do is the same name tag that I've got here and these actually I made with I don't know if you can see it but I got this is a milk carton gallon milk jug I just cut it out and use some waterproof labels that you can buy down at staples or humbip or not a home office or anything like that and cut a hole through it right the name on with indelible markers and it's a pretty cheap way to make a label so take it off of there I get a stapler go ahead and staple it on and you're all set you got it now what you want to do with this is these need to be cooled down for probably six weeks if you're in an area where see we get this is January right now and we've got sunny weather out here in California so these have to go into the refrigerator for six weeks now you should put these I should be doing this in probably November December but we got so busy and we had some other stuff that we had to deal with so I'm doing this in January which is still going to be fine but you really should get it in the winter time once you get these in like this water and it's thick in the refrigerator for me I'm going to stick in the refrigerator for six weeks if you've got cool weather out there and it gets down into the 20s and 30s and 40s for six weeks you'll be fine you can just put them out in your garden and water the way I made this here the pot is I took this regular gallon pot like this and I cut off the top so you can see this is what it looks like I cut it off the reason I cut it off is you really don't need that for to see things the only need just a little bit like this and I'm going to stick in with my refrigerator I've got 15 of them right here that I'm doing right now today and if I got 15 gallon jugs I'll use up my whole refrigerator so anyway that's it I've got about you get about 25 to 50 seeds in each one so I'm going to have here or maybe 200 or 300 little savings and in our next video I'll show you what the savings like when they come up thank you
