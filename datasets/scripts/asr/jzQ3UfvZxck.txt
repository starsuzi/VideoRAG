 Hi I'm Jeremy Pan from School of Wok. Chinese hot pot is a great thing for friends and family to really tuck in and enjoy food how it should be. Fresh ingredients and a great soup base. That's all you really need. So I've got some shiitake mushrooms here for my soup base and then some onions. Some celery, anything you want really goes. If you want it really simple you can get these great sort of sash-rays with sauce here. It's a Sichuan hot pot spicy hot pot sauce. I love the name. Right so straight through and you can see that's going to give it a nice spicy tang to the soup base itself. And once that starts to bubble away then everyone can start to tuck in. But it's all about cooking and enjoying the meal as you go. Tucking guys going go for it. So the real fun of hot pot is all about the condiments and that you know the base of Chinese cuisine. So ginger, garlic, spring onion and then all the best sauces. Chilchiao chili oil, some oyster sauce, pison sauce, sweet soy sauce, some light soy sauce and then some sesame oil to go with that. You can make whatever sauce you want to make your meal the best it can be.
