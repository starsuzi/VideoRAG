 What's up, so there's Chris here at CarrierianPod.com but I just ended up in the kitchen as usual I hope you guys had a great Christmas It's a couple days before New Year's Eve I know on New Year's Day quite a few people like doing preparing something with Black Eyepiece It's supposed to bring good luck for the entire year So in this video I'll be doing something with Black Eyepiece um and I'll use the Harm Boney, I bet at Harm we did a few days back I'm going to use the Harm Boney bone from that to make this a little Carrierian style um Black Eyepiece Survives it up man Here I have two cups of dried Black Eyepiece soaking in six cups of water It's been going for about four hours Four hours is good overnight is even better Now what we're going to do is drain that out We wanted to discard that water because by soaking it and having it in that water it helps for better digestion letton I also have here some fresh thyme I'm a large onion that I diced up and about three cloves of garlic that we're going to start things off with We've got a nice deep heavy pot here in a medium heat Medium flame and I'm just going to go in with a bottle of spoon of olive oil and I like if you've been following me here on YouTube You know I like starting off with the flavors from the start So right away I have here the garlic and all that onion that I'm going to go in there I'm getting that sizzle already happening because the pop was already warm Well hot Now all I'm going to do here now is turn my heat down to low and let that sweat for about three minutes Next up we're going to go in with some fresh ground black pepper Look at all fresh ground this is whatever black pepper you have Right? You know what do you turn the heat on back when I have here Time, fresh thyme Dry thyme would work but I love using fresh thyme when I have the opportunity to do so All spice berries I'm going to go with about five, three and three, six Yeah, six of them in there You've got a quick stir My heat is still on low if you're wondering That's one of waking up that time that's a little bit and that's not pepper And this here is my humble and I took off well it's quite a bit of meat on there still But I took off most of the meat from around it This is totally optional you can use this the ham for making something else But I'm going to toss some that ham in here as well And the reason why I'm tossing it in here is there's some little bit of faulty pockets In the pieces of ham you can see there and I want that to render down a little bit Just to add more of that flavor and remember big on Unpreth in that base of flavor Just want to let that go for about a minute or so And then I'm going to go in with the rest of the ingredients In goes that ham bone And right so I'm going to go in with two medium carrots All the ingredients I use here today as normal would be Down in the description of the video and I'll post this one Caribbean part That calm as well if you want something printable So we've got that going in there the carrots and that ham I've got here some brown sugar Just going to give out a quick stir that brown sugar is just going to add a little hint of sweetness to the To the finished black eyepiece So now time to go in with the black eyepiece that we soaked And we'll need about six cups of water To bring this over together. I'm going to add that shortly. I've got here We're going to go in with I've got here two small bellies well two and a half One large bellief would be fine Some coconut milk I'm going to turn my heat up to high now because I want to bring this up to a boil I'm going to go in with these six cup of water as I said I'm at this point as well. I'm going to go in with some salt I'm not going to go too heavy with the salt at this point because I know that ham was rather salty And once you start cooking down that bone and everything you'll get that salty element from it Finally a little Caribbean sunshine. I've got a green scotch bonnet pepper here. Hold don't break it You break it you're going to release the bees and just flow that bad boy there We're going to bring that up to a boil. We're going to bring it down to a simmer cover it and cook it for about an hour and a half to two hours It's now come up to a boil so I'm just going to reduce my heat all the way down to low. I'm going to give it a quick stir Just to bring everything together and you want to gently now keep in mind you can also fish out The old spice berries there. So be careful. You don't want to fish that out But you do want to skim the pot the top here To get rid of some of that froth and impurities that's You know coming up to the surface. I'm just going to toss that out Again, I'm just going to continue doing that just until it's nice and and clear on the top here My latest going to go on there and my heat is on low And as I said one and a half To two hours remember don't break that beast there It's been about 45 minutes now. I had to lid on it as removed it before I turn the camera on here So I'm going to fish that pepper out That's crushed bonnet pepper. It's still whole it didn't break but I don't want to risk breaking it because then This entire thing is going to become fiery. If heat is your thing you can certainly leave it in there That's going to give it a quick stir. This is starting to thicken up The black eyepiece are getting nice and plump now the aroma in the kitchen is just wonderful If you wanted you can fish out the stems From the time as well Here's where I would suggest tasting it for salt because at this point any sort of salt I was in the bone from that ham There would have already rendered out basically so taste it for salt adjust it And then continue going until it's nice and tender It's been just over an hour and a half because it's a tough hour and 40 minutes Because I had my black eyepiece soaking before they're nice and tender now So before they start falling apart here if you want this thicker you can certainly do that. I'm just removing the beleaves Um, but this is done nice and tender remember to taste it for salt Adjusted to your own liking and remember as I said I keep saying remember but um it will thicken up the more It cools and it comes together. So Chris yeah Caribbean pot.com.
