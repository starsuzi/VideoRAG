 Hello friends, welcome to my kitchen. My today's recipe is super easy and tasty. Today I'm going to show you how to make Shalgam Kisarji or spicy turhams. And after watching my video if you really like this recipe give me your precious feedback by commenting and don't forget to subscribe share my video. So let's start the ingredients. We need 5 to 6 turnips, sugar, tomato, onion, ginger garlic and green chilli, some dry spices and oil. First take a pressure cooker and add 3 to 4 tbsp of oil. When your oil is hot add cumin seeds. Now add ginger and garlic, saute for few seconds. Then add green chillies and onions. Now saute the onions until they get soft and transparent. When onions are done add tamarind powder and red chilli powder. Give it a nice mix and cook for few seconds. Now add these chopped tomatoes, cook these tomatoes until they start melting and become soft. And now add these turnips, wash your turnips and cut them into cubes. Now add salt as per your taste and little bit of sugar. Now mix your turnips until they get nicely coated. Cover it with the lid, cook on a high flame and wait for 5 to 6 whistles. After whistles are done, open the lid and pressure cooker releases its pressure naturally. Now just see my turnips are looking so so amazing. Mash them little bit but not completely. And add the end, add chopped coriander leaves for the freshness, for the colour and the taste. And we are ready to serve. You can also check my spicy turnip recipe without pressure cooker in a pan.
