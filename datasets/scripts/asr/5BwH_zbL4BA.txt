 Hello and welcome back to another edition of Carries Gardening Channel. Today is February the 14th and on February the 7th we started our Gerber Daisy seeds and I had them pre-chilled and the refrigerator. They were ones I had collected myself off of one of my plants and I had stored them in the refrigerator and as a black bag and on February the 11th they started germinating forests so I just wanted to show you here what they look like and see they're still coming up here and any extra seedlings I'll be pricking those out I'll put a link down below for a video that I did on a different plant when I pricked out the extra seedlings and it's still the same way you just want to make sure you get them out when they're still little so I just wanted to show you that now we will start feeding these when they start getting their true leaves on them we'll feed them with miracle grow water soluble all-purpose plant food a fourth teaspoon to a gallon of water and we'll make sure our soil is well watered in moist before we feed our plants because we don't want to burn the root systems on them and the reason why we feed our plants is I wanted them to develop a nice strong healthy root system because the root system is what takes up your nutrients to the plant so it gives the plant its water it helps absorb its food so that's why we want to make sure we establish a good root system on them so as soon as they start getting their true leaves I'll start feeding them with that and I'll feed them once a week with that mixture and I'll come back with more updated videos as they continue to grow and establish themselves so if you like my video please like, comment, subscribe if you have any questions you can leave them below and I'll try and answer them for you please don't forget to hit that little notification button that'll tell you I'm gonna put a new video on thank you for watching and hope you have a nice day bye
