 Today we're going to show you how to properly clean vehicle carpets. For that we will need one industrial degreaser, one hard brush, where is it? Here it is, hard brush, one power washer and obviously dirty carpets. Okay, the procedure is we take some water and wet the carpets thoroughly. Yeah, go ahead. So only make them soak, all of them. I think that should be good. Okay. Now use degreaser on the carpets. Hold it like this, it's going to be that rye. You can spray more, don't be afraid. The more the better, especially on the dirty sections. All right, is this good? Yeah, that's good. Now use the brush and brush all of these carpets. This is dirty? That's okay. It's forming pretty well. Yeah, it is, it's degreaser. It's supposed to form otherwise you've got something else. Some dirty carpets, I'll tell you that. Oh yeah, great. You'll be amazed with the result. Couple of my touch-ups. You need to go. Do this spot right there? This one right here, yeah, that's the dirtiest spot I've got. Well, this carpet is a little worn, but I think it's still usable as long as it's not ripped. Okay. No, I think that should be sufficient enough. Now, what we do, we take these carpets and we put them on the wall. Let's go ahead and rip. Okay, and now the final stage to make the drying faster. We're going to use this scraper, just a regular ice scraper, yes. Go ahead. All the way down. Okay. Okay. Okay.
