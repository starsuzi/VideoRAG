 Shalom, today we will show you how to make a native Philippine dessert, Okaio coconut candy. For this delectable dessert, you will need a friend to climb a coconut tree, five coconuts, two pounds of brown sugar, one cup of water, a hand grater, a machete and a wok. When you are kicking the coconuts down, make sure to hang onto the front, it's a long way down. Watch the whole video to find out what else you need. Another precaution, when climbing a coconut tree, watch out for the rats and lizards that are waiting on top to surprise you. When opening a coconut tree, do not set the coconut flat on the cement. When you are opening it with a machete, the coconut will simply bounce. Our friend here is the beginner. Put water and sugar together in a wok and bring it to a boil. Add the grated coconut. And constantly stir to keep the mixture from sticking to the wok. Stir until the sugar is caramelized and gets to be in a cane instinct. Take the bucaya out of the hot pan and don't wait another second. Drop it in the size you desire on a wax paper. Thank you for watching. When I'm at the Philippines, I will make a bucaya out video for you guys as an update. Who knows I might even climb a coconut tree myself.
