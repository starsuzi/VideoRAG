 I make vanilla bean extract once a year and it lasts me for the whole year for baking and I actually use vanilla extract that I make in natural perfume heri 2. But so it's very easy to make you just want to get a bunch of really good quality vanilla beans and you slice them down the middle and you're gonna need about 8 vanilla beans to one cup of a good quality vodka, rum or brandy. You can even just use like leftover vodka that you have even mix them together. It's just fine. So you slice it down the middle because in here is where the flavor is and this is the like the caviar of the bean. It looks like this. So this is the beautiful part of it. So you want to have all that go into the extract. Some people actually scoop all that out and then they put it in the jar and you know add it to the alcohol that takes time to do all that. So I just slice it down the middle and then you know I do about 1 inch strips and then you add that to the your jar and then you just keep doing that just slice it all your beans down the middle and try to open it up a little bit so you can get that into the alcohol. So look for like these are Madagascar beans which oh the scent is just just beautiful on them. They're there known to have a really good vanilla bean and nowadays you can find them more readily available at places and they are expensive you know so but when you think of like how much should have vanilla extract costs if you use a lot of vanilla extract then this is a great way to make your own and then I'll also give it as gifts too. And also after you're done infusing then you know into the alcohol so it'll take about two months usually I give it two months sometimes three if I don't need it right away you know then then it's ready so you're gonna put the you know your alcohol on top of these cover it and then you're gonna put this in a dark cool place and let it set there for about at least you know two months and then each day afterwards like the first week if you can remember to put it out and you also you can see it to shake it it's really good to shake it and every time like say you go if you keep it in a pantry or if you keep it in a cover you know everything now and then when you think about it shake it and then you can just let it set the longer sometimes it sets than the the more flavor it is you can you know let it even set some people even will do up to to six months and what you can do is so then afterwards after you have it all it's been setting and it's after you know at least two months then you're gonna just take a sieve and strain out the beans out of the vanilla extract and then you package your vanilla extract either you know in bottles or you keep it in in this you know jar and then the beans you just dry with a paper towel and you can either make bean paste with it which is very expensive in in stores you know to purchase and you would just throw your beans in a blender or food processor with some sugar and then that's your paste or some people just add it to have vanilla flavored sugar they just you know once the beans are dried on paper towel that they put the beans into sugar and then you have the middle of the sugar which is really nice so then you know you want to make sure and label your vanilla extract and put the date on it you can use these glass pens that right on glass or you can use you know you just put a sticky label on it but it's it's it's a it's a beautiful extract and it's you know it's well worth making it
