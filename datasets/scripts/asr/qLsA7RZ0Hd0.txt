 Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel and today I'm showing you how to make your own pottery barn inspired mercury glass I've been seeing these everywhere in home decor magazines and I think these are so cute So I figured I'd show you guys how to make it yourselves So you're gonna need glass phases vinegar spray bottle paper towels and the most important Krylon looking glass spray paint Now leave a link below as to where you can get it on Amazon It's unfortunately not available on Canada But you can find it in the States but make sure that it is this brand in particular or else the end result won't look the same To start you're gonna want to prep your spray so in my spray bottle I already have half water And the portions are half water and half vinegar. It doesn't matter how much you put in just as long as this equal amount And once you've got your vinegar in there, you just unscrew your cap back on and give it a shake You're also going to want to make sure that your spray bottle is set to a mist setting So it's not shooting like a water gun Now take your spray paint and spray in the inside of the glass The technique here is to do light bursts It'll allow you to control the paint a little bit better and it'll prevent you from spraying too much And since the vase is a little enclosed the spray paint will kind of build up in there So all you're gonna want to do is just tilt it around and evenly coat the inside as best as you can Once the inside of your vase is evenly coated you're gonna want to let the paint dry for about 60 seconds at most Then grab your spray bottle and spritz the inside of the vase Give the vinegar a few seconds then grab your paper towel, wrap it on your finger and then lightly dab at the droplets You'll start to notice that wherever the vinegar hits on the paint is where it will come off So if there's not enough paint that came off or if you want some more paint back on it Spray more spray paint or spray some more vinegar and just keep going until your desired look When I did mine I actually discovered that if you dab at the paint and slightly drag it a bit It'll actually move the paint around and create this crackle effect So I kept it because I liked it so do whatever you like and do whatever you're satisfied with So here's the final product they make great home decor pieces on their own or you can stick fake flowers in them, put your makeup brushes in them or what I did I just put candles in them so that's it from my DIY for today I hope you guys enjoyed it and I hope you tried it out if you liked this video Please give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel and be sure to follow me on all my social media links I'll see you guys in my next video.
