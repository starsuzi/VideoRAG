 Hi Brian from Apex Detail. TAR and Road Grime kicked up by your tires can be a real pain to clean up. Let me show you a couple ways to get rid of it. We're going to clean and touch up this rocker panel and there are a couple ways to do about it. Get a little all purpose. One way to do it is with the Magic Eraser, one of my favorite tools. Now all these tools will be abrasive and will attack the clear code aggressively. But I'm going to have to polish anyways so it's fine. Another thing you can do is grab a well used clay bar. Grab a microfiber and get the area ready for some touch up. On this side we'll use some solvent to get this tar off. And for the wheel well lip we'll go back to the Magic Eraser and clean that up for touch up paint. A keyboard piece of clay bar and Magic Eraser for this area. We'll double check the area with some solvent and get it ready for touch up. Although these areas are hard to see they're part of a full detail and must be taken care of accordingly. A little touch up and we're good to go. Thanks for watching today's video. Bride from Apex Detail.
