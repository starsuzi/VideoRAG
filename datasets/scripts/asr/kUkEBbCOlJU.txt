 Hey y'all welcome back to my channel today. We're gonna make the best homemade chicken salad Yes, but before we do that you know I got to do a shameless blue go to stove top kisses.com grab all of my books Yes, let's get into the tutorial y'all So we're gonna start with the whole chicken. I like to use a whole chicken in my chicken salad Not a key to good chicken salad is using the pie the leg the wing the breast all over That's what you want to use Please don't use boneless chicken breast because it's gonna be real water and you don't want that It's gonna be nasty and I'll be sucked up so I got a whole chicken and I'm working with today Okay, and we're gonna add some water to that. I put it in my favorite beat up pot y'all know I love this pot Okay, now the key to good chicken salad is the seasoning You got to make sure this seasoning is sucked up if your seasoning is good I'm telling you your chicken salad. That's the foundation of a great chicken salad So I'm adding my noirs chicken bouillon you must have that Okay, and you got to have some garlic powder some onion powder a little pepperica and some season So I'll list all that in the description box. Don't you worry and then I'm gonna add this is optional I just feel like I give it real good flavor But we're gonna remove those peppers at the end once the chicken cooks down I'm gonna add some frozen bell pepper and onion just to give it some flavor We're not gonna use that in the chicken salad, but it's just makes it real soft up and good y'all You got to have a trust me now if you don't like it then no added Joe chicken salad But baby you got to have that season up in there So we're just gonna put the chicken on the stove and let it cook on medium heat bring it to a boil For about an hour and a half until it's really tender and then what you want to do is just taste it and Adjust your season and taste the broth and see then want the chicken get super tender Add your eggs because you want that egg to be chopped up in there, okay? So I like to do this right here so my ears get a little bit of that chicken flavor in there Oh, be good as hell, okay? It's the church-laden chicken salad, okay? Put your lid on let your eggs cook about six minutes, okay? Then take them out cool them off then we're gonna remove our chicken now you want to strain the chicken and Save that stock if you can cuz that's some good to say your chicken stock Okay, say that for Thanksgiving all that stuff, okay? Don't throw your stop away to some good chicken stock and I removed the chicken from the bone I let it cool a little bit and removed it from the bone and this chicken was so tender I didn't really have to shred the whole lot That's how you know that chicken is good and tender when you don't really have to shred the whole lot, okay? It shreds on its own now We're just gonna put our mayo in there and this is a really good kitchen hack for you guys Removing your eggs just cut the egg down the middle with the sharp knife and as you can see take a spoon and whoo Baby you got a pillow eggs baby just put it out just like that all right So I chop my eggs. I put it up in that bowl Now I'm adding my sala cues or your sweet relish for those of you who don't know what sala cues are sometimes you got Sala cues sometimes you got sweet relish, but if you can't find sala cues you sweet relish is just bad child Okay, add your little sugar in there cuz the chicken salad got a half a little sugar after key ingredient Okay, then a little peprika just for color cuz you know it don't taste like none I don't know why people think that peprika tastes like some kind of tastes like none all right And I'm just adjusting my season is and everything else when I see this because you don't really know season because that season That chicken is season and it's good and soft up you ain't got to add no salt no pep and no nothing just a just Your mayo your sweet relish and a little bit of sugar if you want to then we're gonna refrigerate it for a few I was then put it on top of some light bread or some rich crackers and love crackers and baby Good to see you all right talk to y'all later
