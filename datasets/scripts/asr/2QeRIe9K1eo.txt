So each one of these balls or you know You just drop the balls into the boiling water. I've never tried this brand before But I'm about to see how these are going to taste I already have my shrimp And That has already been it was just some frozen shrimp pre cook frozen shrimp So as you can see my pan is starting to heat up a little bit I'm going to turn the fire down just a little bit And I'm going to go ahead and add my chicken I'm going to get a spoon here And I'm going to just let this simmer So I can get nice and fully brown on all the way through and I'm going to let that cook I'm going to go ahead and drop my noodles into the water since it is boiling Let me rinse my hand rope with So I did touch that chicken And in my water Okay, so I'm going to drop um Let's do four balls of Oh, yeah, let's do four So I use four nest, okay, so I think that'll be enough more than enough So I'm going to let all of this cook through And once it cooks down some Especially the chicken I will be back So I'll be back guys Okay guys, so the chicken is done And what I'm going to do now is here's my shrimp.

I just add a little water and just continue to add it in And I'm going to start that around And at this point you want to make sure that your heat Is not extremely too high because you do not want to Um over cook the shrimp So I did turn my heat. It's still on medium Like a meaty well low to medium heat And I am going to and you basically and you add it to sauce So what you want to do now is You want to just let that just simmer for about five to ten minutes Because you really just you're really now just heating up everything So while that is simmering I've already Let me move the camera closer so you guys can see Okay, so this is just a really taught really like light salad And um in salad it is a spring mix With a little bit of cucumbers in there I've already the noodles are already finished So I'm going to and you want to make sure that you shock your noodles with a little cold water To stop to prevent them from cooking So I'm just going to put a few noodles here on my plate Look at that beautiful spread it out a little bit You can actually and the dressing that I'm going to use Is this Greek vinaigrette And I usually find this brand at Aldi and I absolutely love love this dressing You don't need a whole lot It it's so good Um, so I'm going to drizzle A little of that on my salad A little like that Rinse the toes off that I had before And just kind of like toss and toss that around in there So Then what I'm going to do now is I'm going to come back to my let me zoom out I'm going to plate this now Let's let this simmer for another five minutes.
