 Hey guys, welcome back to another episode of House Plants Dream. Today I'm just going to quickly show you how to propagate rubber plants in general. I'm going to show you three different types, but basically they're all belong to the Ficus family, so the method would be the same. So it doesn't matter which variety you've got. So right in front of you is a Ficus lemon and lime. This one I took the cutting of the mother plant that I've got and probably only a week ago because this is a tip cutting. I did remove the growth tip, then it's only been a week and as you can see the growth is quite significant. So hopefully it'll focus. So you can see roots popping up at the bottom and then we've got this new growth happening as well. Let's see if I can do... oh sorry, obviously Daisy. There you go. So all these are new growth. So I think I'll probably leave it in the water for another week or so then I'll pot it up and there are more roots coming as well. All the white dots are where the roots are going to emerge. Yeah, so this one only cut just below the node and it's been doing really well rooting in water and I think the weather really helps as well because it's early springy, and it likes a warmer environment. So that's the lemon line and then here there are some more written bay rubber plants that I took cuttings and you can see this one. It's actually growing a new shoot. So they're all doing really well and you can see the white bits. They are the roots forming in water. So it looks great. Yeah, and I'll just quickly show you at the end one of the rubber plant I recently potted up and saying it was rooted in water and it's been doing really well and now you can see new shoots coming up. There are actually five cuttings that I put together. So there you go. That's how you propagate your rubber plants in general and I hope you find this video useful and good luck and have your propagating. Thank you. Bye.
