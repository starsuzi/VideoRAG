 Prime Music Gooseberries, blackcurrants, redcurrants, gooseberries. It's actually really beneficial to plant them a little bit below grade. So burying it a little bit like more than you would kind of think to. Because what they do when they when their wood makes contact with soil is it forms roots where like an apple tree when the wood makes contact with soil it usually rots. So these will it will encourage better rooting and then for some reason when you bury them they send up shoots from beneath the soil. So they'll bush out quicker. So that's a good little tip there. And even with the mulch you can kind of. Highlight up around it and actually a lot of nurseries what they'll do is called stool mounting. So with currency gooseberries like say this current was pretty big. I cut the entire plant down to the base and then let it sprout up a bunch of sprouts and then you just pile sawdust around those sprouts and then they all root and as they root you just separate them from the mother plant and then you've like exponentialized your amount of plant material. Or what you can do is you can root these from hardwood cuttings really really easy. That's what this is here. You literally take a cutting late winter early spring. No rooting hormone, nothing just stick it in the soil, leave a couple of buds exposed and they root like 95% of the time. So that's what that is too. Super easy to propagate. And the gooseberries have small thorns on them and the berries actually they look like they have thorns on the gooseberries but they're not spiky. The thorns on the branch are spiky but on the fruit you can eat it and it's fine. They're like hairy little hairs. The gooseberries I find nobody messes with those. The deer don't mess with them. Oh yeah. The deer, the rabbit, anything. You'll find those growing wild in the forest. Yeah.
