 Hello everyone, today I'm going to show you how to clean water type floor mats. These things. These are water type floor mats if you don't have access to gardeners. Now these water type floor mats are designed to clean your... to be cleaned over and over with a garden hose, but if you're in a situation where you don't have a garden hose, you can use your bathtub. Just gotta make sure you have a little bathtub and not just a shower stall. So let's continue on. So step one to clean the bathtub is to fill it up with some water, preferably hot water. Alright, I'm going to let that fill up while I don't prepare anything. Where it goes? The bathtub is filled, no need to. So no need to take it or take it. In this case the driver's side, then you're just going to put it in water either way, up side down, right side up doesn't matter. Soak it. Alright, so now the mat is soaking. Take your favorite degreaser dish soap, it must be dish soap, which is also degreaser and oils. They're an old sponge, an old sponge and then I kind of do it just to scrub. And once you have done one side, rinse it, repeat for the opposite side. Now rinse it up. Oh and here is basically the near end result. I will take a better picture of this. So right now I'm going to try it. Now what you have to do is dry it. And congratulations, we now are clean, almost, until the sun dries out. Now if you do want to shine this thing up with like, shine this thing up, what you could do is you could get like an oil, like an oil and just rub it in. Like I think you could just use like spray oil or spray water. And that would like to shine this, shine is just temporary, but then it's all, I don't know if that's good, it's a little slippery. But we'll see, that would be for another video. Thank you for watching and I'll see you guys later. You
