 Hi one haystime today is December 11th 2013 and do you guys remember when I did so many you might remember I did some harvesting of day lilies seeds outside? Well I did the paper towel method on the day lilies seeds because I wanted to see if they're viable. I had a gal say well that's not how I harvest my seeds. Day lilies seeds. I always harvest everything when it's dry okay? The seeds were black and she harvested them when I think they're more on the green side so we're going to see if they germinated. I howl is best way to test for germination of anything you saved outside is with the paper towel method okay? So it's going to be fun to see how they did and I just wanted to share that with you today because I want you to know that you can save your day lilies seeds in the fall if you like and then test them for germination grow new day lilies because you never know what color you are going to get when you are starting them from seed because they cross pollinate probably a lot of them could cross pollinate and you just never know what you're going to get so it'll be kind of fun because I had one cell cell seed outside from Estella deora and it turned out to be beautiful beautiful color two different colors together and I was thrilled when I seen that because it's not it's not a date early that I planted so I thought well I better start saving some seed okay and just just for fun because growing from seed is one one of my most favorite hobbies to do in the winter time here in the midwest and I think it might take up to three years for them to bloom from seed which you know that could be something might take a little more time a lot of you might not have patience but those of you that do you just follow along with me and let's see how they done all right let's check it out I want to tell you I put these day lilies seeds in the fridge for a month actually it was longer than a month you got to chill them so October 27th 2013 took out around November 27th 2013 and today's December 11th so it's been a little while and they've been in my south window I wanted to see if they would germinate in a warm area like that let's see what happened now if anything has happened we're going to be planting some of these downstairs oh boy paper towels good and wet but it doesn't seem to bother them oh look at this guys oh my you know these have been sitting a while I wanted them to grow a little bit because looks like summer still germinating check it out a little baby day lily isn't that the coolest there's one there's two some of these aren't big now if you let these sit they'll keep growing in this paper towel that is merely what I want to do because there'll be a lot easier to plant there's three there's one just starting to germinate four five there's six just starting seven there's eight nine 10 11 and there's another little one some of these yeah they're not viable so what look at how many I got there's another one just starting so I'll keep some of these I'm just going to plant about a six pack put them in a six pack and put them in a moist area so they can take root but check it out guys it worked save your day lily seeds in the fall some will be good some won't if they crossed you're going to know it and you know this is the best way to know is the test for germination using the paper towel method how fun and how cool is that just be very careful when you pick them up you can see the root so these will be planted like this facing down or the root facing down into the soil just going to be really careful picking them up sometimes they'll stick to the paper towel but they didn't hear so they're fine see we got one two three four five six let's see let's do this one put this one back what I'm going to do is plant just this mini right now okay the rest I'm going to let them grow some more and see if more germinate okay is that sound fair yeah let's do that put them back in the sack and they'll go back in my south window so it worked great I am thrilled to know that collecting your black day lily seeds in the fall works and I would really recommend any of you that want to just experiment with this and have fun to do it but you got to chill these for a month in the fridge before you you know test them for germination and also bring them out I mean into the heat that is what it was recommended okay so let's go plant these now all right I got a six pack ready with my priding soil which is peat per light and a little bit of bark that is what I normally use for almost everything here is my little baby day lilies they look a lot like the cow lilies did when I when I tested for germination too so as you can see pretty neat huh so we're just going to plant them not going to be hard to do I'm just going to make a little indention in the soil now you just got to be kind of careful with them and you can see you can see the root and you can see what part has to go in the soil not even a worry about that little seed head there okay this is a really long root very neat so make that press that down a little further a little dirty but don't matter nothing matters here you find your own way of doing your own thing your own growing but it's just a guideline just kind of sharing with you how I do it these are a little smaller so what's really good is to let these grow let these grow a little bit before you plant them so much easier so okay so I got in the end I'm just going to water them in again and these should take off like crazy what I'm going to use and what I use for a lot of things is I use these trays I got that have the dome lids so I can get I think four six packs in here or somewhere in there but I'm going to be planting more and I just close it up keep to humidity in while they're setting root it's important for these now if I wouldn't put this humidity thing on if I didn't get down here one day they could be dead so it's very important keep that humidity in which let them root up so they'll go under my lights now I'm going to put them up here under my lights that I'm under my 40 watt of shop lights piece of cake we'll see how they do I might check on these in a week in video tape a little bit more all right here's an update on the day lily seeds that I collected this fall we have more germination and some of them have grown a little bigger and some are not sprouted yet so there's probably going to be something on viable which is fine you know you're not going to get viable seeds on everything and I'm definitely going to have plenty we're going to go downstairs right now I'm going to give you show you how the ones are doing that I planted all right we're in my grow room downstairs and these are the day lilies that I planted just gosh you know I didn't put a date on this shame on me it hasn't been that long though I would say four four or five days maybe not even that but as you can see they're doing really really good aren't they what I probably will do is if these get too long and stretchy I'll probably trim them down so they can grow new leaves but it's amazing isn't it and I'm going to plant another six pack right now but the key is to keep these moist especially you know you want them to root down keeping a moist is key that's why I'm using this little plastic dome lid and it's done wonderfully hi everyone hey today's January 20th 2014 and I'm just going to do an update on my day lily seedlings to let you know how they're doing now these aren't fast growing but they are growing I was able to I have ten seedlings here I've lost a couple which is kind of normal but as you can see they're growing they don't look too bad and what I'm doing as you can see there's some cuttings here I trim them off every now and then when they get a little bit leaky and leafed out what that's going to do is promote new growth new leaf growth and what's what you want you want your you want them to become fuller not stretchy but fuller and it's working out really good these will actually look pretty good and I wanted to share that with you because I want to encourage everyone to get out in your garden in the fall see the seeds that are in your garden the flowers and plants that have made and the vegetables that have went to seed and collect them and just have fun with I mean this was the first time for me to collect in my seeds and it worked out pretty well and I'm really really pleased with you know you never know what's going to happen you know how these seeds are going to germinate and how they're going to grow but when they do grow it's really really a blessing isn't it but these days lilies now we'll be going out we'll be putting them out when our weather gets warm here in the Midwest which will be quite a while yet um and I'm going to watch them mark them because if I don't mark them I'll probably forget where they came from and because they're going to be a different color it's going to be interesting to see like in three to four years when they do flower it's going to be interesting to see you know the flowers you know the colors so I just wanted to share that with you that they're doing pretty good and I was able to keep them and keep them on growing and like I said they're not fast growers but what I need to do now is give them a little bit of organic fertilizer just a very little to kind of help promote root development and leaf development and just to get them off to a really really good start so I you know I wanted to in this now I don't know I might have an update on it later but I always wanted to encourage everybody to think outside the box once in a while there's a lot of things going on in the garden um and if you look around and just take a look and see you're going to find out there's a lot of things you can do in the garden especially in the fall where you can collect your seeds and use them from years to come it's a rewarding practice and you know I kind of encourage everyone to do it so thanks so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and I will be bringing to you lots more of these videos as time permits and I'm just glad that you're here and I just want to say thanks
