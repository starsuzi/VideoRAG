 Hi guys, it's Audrey and I'm here with my sister. Jordi from just 133. Today we're going to be testing some more sign kits and you guys seem to love making slime. So today we're going to be making our Nickelodeon slime and also the smooth foam kits that make a slime kit and we're going to see which one is better. This one cost $23 and this one was $33. That's a lot of money for some slime but yeah, so we're going to be making two slimes each from each kit or maybe four slimes in total. Two from here, two from here and then testing them to see which slime kit is better and which you should buy. So let's go! Okay, this is not cockage. Goodly all ready, like what? It comes in a bag, like a trash bag. The paint spilled. No, are you leaked? No. The red is exploded! Hey, at least you didn't get really crazy like our first one. It's still got on other things. It's like it's gotten on some of these ones, it's gotten on the bag. Yeah. Oh, it's an apple! I can't even have a go. I'm going to be making first the alien egg slime and I have red that is structured before hand and apparently it takes two to three hours to grow. Oh, something else spilled. What spilled? You're making the translucent slime, right? Yeah, I'm going to make see-through slime. Yay! Yeah, let's not mix for slime. That's what it is, it's open! That's what it is! Yep, it's this slime activator. So all ready not to press with Nickelodeon because it's like everywhere. It's cracked open. It's open. We have even opened up these boxes really like we looked at the instructions but we haven't touched anything. How's it leaked I think it has. Oh my, I got a water balloon mine. It's not pretty happy. It's still burst. The safety still burst until it started leaking. I'm so excited to make the alien egg slime recipe because I've never made anything like this before. So, let's go! I can make black stick glitter, party, foam and glow. I'm going to give you a water balloon. I'm glad that they get some water. Oh, these look like armies! They are armies. The alien eggs are practically just orbeans. They are. So, so these are the alien eggs. They're just practically orbeans. They're almost orbeans because these are the things that take two to three hours to grow. So, save those alien eggs and make it all. This is for the glue that I have. That means that's all the slime that I'm going to get because the glue, the amount of glue is the amount of slime that you get. The heck? So I'm not going to get very much slime. But, okay. I've got my orbeans! Yay! Okay, so now I have to fill up these with warm water using this. One by one. Why? What? Okay, doing the instructions. Mine smells really weird. Right now mine's just glue. See, like I messed up already. I feel like I'm not doing this right. It's like a super watery right now. Here's this very cutie. Is that the slime? Is that how I... Slime of water and that's it. And now, now I can either go me on a bright glow. Silly, party. What is this? You see that? You, it's like foaming. So I can't show you guys, but the sodium tetra borer is like bowling. It's like I'm a witch and mixing my potions. I'm going to make either glitter or party. Let's do party. Go party to make party slime at the whole bag of confetti glitter into the bowl with the glue and water. Okay. Just basically glitter. Add them in glitter. Well, no, this one is just confetti glitter. Oh, there's no plants. It's a full thing. Oh, okay. Oh. Oh my gosh. That's a lot of glitter. That's one sparkle party. I have to say something on my slime. Having a party. It's not even mixing in. Uh oh. It's just basically glitter. How is this made slime with that? I don't know how I'm supposed to... I think you're supposed to pull this in once the slime is done to be made. But it doesn't say, here is my slime. Yay. Okay. Now I'm pouring in my slime. Okay. Here is my slime. Yay. Um. Okay. Now I'm pouring in my slime activator. Oh, it is thickening up. Yay. Wow. Oh. I'm so excited right now. Yes. I think you all. I'm like the Hulk over here. Oh my. This might actually be really, really good. Okay. Oh. Yes. Okay. I'm going to with my hands. Forget the slime stick. Okay. Is just really slime though. It is to be a little bit more watery, but it's a little bit um, starting to eat right now. Nickelodeon knows how to make their slime. Wow. This is good. I feel like it's more fun to do. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is this? It's seen through. Oh, it is transparent. They did get that right. Oh, it doesn't work. Okay. This is kind of cool. Do you like it? Is that it? Are you done? Mine is done. This is my slime. However, I want to add a bit more watery. But it just says to keep playing with it and then it will um, make it soft and stretchy. So, I don't know. So far, this is much better than all the other slime kits that we tried. What color should I do? They said that the ones right here are going to dark. And these are all neon. I think I should do neon on because go in the dark and have a little work. Yeah, do neon. Do orange. Yeah, do orange neon. Do you think they did go in the dark because you can see all the orgy's. No, you can add a go in the dark and orange. No, they said only one. I'm going to do go in the dark. I mean, do go in the dark and test it. Okay, so now you can start making more from the skin. This is not. This is not what I'm making. It does. Oh, yes. Go and make a lot of it go. Make a lot of it. Yeah. Okay, do you want to start making yours from this kit now? Yeah. The mega slime kit. Next slime for me. Okay, you ready guys? Every time we do a video like slime, everyone says that we're doing it wrong because we're not slowly mixing it. So I'm not. I slowly do it. I slowly did it for this slime and it worked really nicely. So hey, it's kind of working. It's starting to form. It's going to make me see. I'm going to use these beads and I'm going to make like foam crunchy slime. I'm really excited about this because I've like made crunchy slime before. But I've never made foam slime with these little foam beads. So I'm really excited to see how it's going to turn out. Hopefully it's going to be good. Look guys. Yeah. Dude, it's working good. This one's working. Pusing them the other one. I'm. There's a lot of steps to the mega slime kits. Oh, oh my gosh. Look, look, look, look, look, look. Look, look, look, look, look. Dude, it's like so weird. Dude. I made it out in the orbit. Look how pretty this is. And you don't have to add a mullet. I know. I'm only going to add a few. Oh, it's cold now. Ah. Oh, the orbees are going everywhere. They're not sticking to the slime. Come on, orbees. Uh oh. We have to like need them in. Really good. It's said in the packet that orbees like to fly out on the bowl or the alien eggs. Yes, the orbees are going into my slime. Yay. Oh, it's very hard to get these orbees to stick inside the slime. But this is what my slime looks like. It's like orbees galore. All right, so I'm done with this slime. You like it? I think I love it. Oh, like all the dark. I love it. That feels weird. It's very cool. So I'm going to move on to the Nickelodeon slime. That's going to be super fun because I love the Nickelodeon slime. It's super easy. So I'm going to be the opaque slime. What should I do? Shake off silly. I don't understand why I'm supposed to do next. I'm going to go silly to make a slime at the whole bag of googly eyes into the bowl with gluing water. Googly eyes. Let me get my slime silly. Filling slime. This bag is now officially glue. Yay. Oh my gosh, it's sticking to me. Just go into the glorimector. And it never says to add in color. But I'm just going to add in some color. Tricks that. Yeah! I'm adding orange. That's a lot of beads. I'm stepping all over beads now. I'm so excited. Woo! It's like cereal to me. My bowl's leaking. What? It's leaked. It has leaked. Got it fast. Hurry. More beads. I can never have too many beads. Do you like that one? I want to add a little bit more running so I might add in water because I think I added it in a little bit too much activator. Uh oh. Okay, so it's not slime. Dren. It's not slime. What happened? And I added in all the activator. Should I add in more water? Maybe. I'm going to add in more water. I'm going to add a little bit more water because mine's just literally watered. Like what? It's still just like. What are you doing? I'm going to use this. It looks fun. I'm trying to mix it with this bowl that's too small. It's just so confusing. Really? I don't feel anything. I'm adding in more activator and more glue. Going rogue. Going rogue because it's trying to tell me to use the other activator. Which one? That one right there. Because that one's the broken one that's linked every where maybe that's the reason why. Didn't you use this one? No, I used the other one. Are you kidding me? Maybe that's why. Is that gonna do anything? Okay, it's gonna be something with the paint. Because I did in zero paint. Mine turned out just fine. But you also had crazy clear glue. I don't know why mine's just water. It's like the red slime. It's like a lava slime. Go watch that video of us trying five dollar slime kits. So far, not unprecedented Glowian. It's not working. I can't figure out why yours doesn't work. I'm adding a lot of glue in. This is not slime. I'm confused. I'm confused too. Yours turned out so good. And here's mine like. What? Okay. Okay, mine's like. It rips. So I don't think this is really slime, but more of a putty. Maybe your magical touch can do something to it. Because you always get slime work. Okay, I finally stretched it out. It takes ages to stretch out. It's not really slime. It's just more like a putty. It's like, what? Dram, will you try working on this one? I have all your work on this one. Yeah. It's too like sweaty like. We're switching because Dram might be able to fix this slime. Yeah. We're using the activator from this other kit. Ooh, this works. This works. This works. So it's a clear activator that doesn't work. Why didn't it clear activator work for my men, not for yours? No idea. Maybe it's because it works on the transparent glue, but it doesn't work for the... Why though? For the white glue. This feels amazing. You're getting somewhere, see? What's that like? See, I told you, she's like a miracle worker with this stuff. It drops its own. It's like a professional. It's like a professional. It's like a professional. It's like a professional. It's like a professional. It's like a professional. Oh my god! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Right! We're just like the Sims when there's a fire. I did it. Oh! Sticks! Oh my god. Get it off! This officially gets a negative from me. I'm not impressed with the opaque slime, honestly. It's like ruined my shirt. Why? This slime is like, wow, look at it. It's like a crunchy beast. You're like, Look, this is so fine. It's a bouncy ball. It's a bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, Oh! I didn't get in my hair. No! Wow, look at the blow that's up in here. This is a really good slime. No, no, no, no, no, no. Do you like it like this? Or do you want more? How? Or you? You'd be the designer. Oh, I don't think it's supposed to be funny because it's more like a crunchy slime. I'm gonna start playing with mine to see how it's going because look at that. It's like a boil. You added a blue to it. Mark. Oh, you did. You're bouncing it around. You added it instead of the blue. Here's my alien slime. Yay! That's how I want that one to be. Like how sticky this is. Oh! Every time I play with this slime, it's so sticky. Or if you just fall out, it's the struggle when you're leveled. I gotta keep playing with this. It's so sticky. Look, it's literally like a slime ball. It's like slime ball. Okay, I'm adding more water. I need more water too. Just saying, if this just appears, not my fault, you ask me. Okay. More water for me too. Tell us in the comments down below what your guys favorite slime is. Okay, I officially like this slime kit more than that one. I started out liking this one a lot, but now I think I do like that one. Yeah, this one's more and cheaper. Oh, you made it perfect. It's really sticky. It's delicious, isn't it? I want to love this sticky slime. Maybe a bit too old. I hate this slime. Smells weird. I love this slime. So we're going to finish up these slime and come back when they're all done. Alright, so we have both of our slimes made here. There's smooth foam kid slime. And here are the Nickelodeon slime. Already, I can tell that the Nickelodeon slime is a lot smaller than these slime. These slime. Yeah, this is the actor amount that it's supposed to make. Because they come with little jars, they contain them. Yeah, this is like our experiment one that we tried to save because it didn't know it would work. So we added an extra glue, that's why it's overflowing. Yeah. So start off with Nickelodeon. This is the party slime that I made. It's still slime. Oh, that's your own. Here's a silly slime I made. And I don't know, these are like really thick slime. It's like we prefer our slime to be more runny. Yeah, hers is like pretty because it makes a really good sound. It does stretch like that. That's why mine does. Let's listen to this. Wow. And mine, I just don't like this slime as much. I don't like that slime. It doesn't. It's bouncy. Oh yeah, let's have a bounce contest ready? And look, you can hear it too. Because the Google AI. Alright, let's have a bounce contest. Ready, set, go. One, two. Alright, yours is already better than this one. So I actually like how this one looks. I don't really like this one as much. So for Nickelodeon, I probably rate it like four on the slime scale. Yes. I give it a five because it's not the perfect slime. It's not our type of slime. It's more puddy-ish. But a lot of people like their slime like this. And I get to be good because it comes in the travel container. You could take it like wherever. If you want to take it in the car, this like if you drop it, it's not going to immediately stick to everything. So I say this is like would be good for like travel slime. But now for the other mega slime kit. This is like the best kit ever. So I love how my alien slime turned out. The orbit is like the fallout of it. But it even says in the instructions that the orbit is like fling everywhere. But it's so cool. So for the longest time while making this, I was like, well, just this remind me of. And I finally figured out, it reminds me of grandma. Yes. Because when the grandma is trying like bad, they have like these little balls at the back of their back. And that's what this slime reminds me of. It's so weird and random. This one is more, it's not, it's still not my type of slime. Because you could like rip it. True, but it's crunchy. It's more of a texture slime. I love this one though. That's like this one turned out really good. I love it. That's like our favorite type of slime. This one can still stretch though. So it's still like really cool and fun to play with. I don't know. I still like it. So for the slime kit, I rate this one like a 10. I rate this one. It depends. And eight. Let's go test to see if this slime is glow in the dark. Like it says on this instruction. Let's go. All right. So let's test to see if this slime is glow in the dark. Turn off the light. All right. So this slime, I can't always see that much in the dark. Maybe I'm still holding up more underneath the light. So far, it's eight. The slime didn't really glow that well. Maybe it's more in our part. I put it outside with the sun for a couple minutes. But maybe it needs longer. I don't know. So overall, the slime foam kit has one and it's $10 cheaper than the nickel loading kit. See if this looks like an anvil. And the nickel loading kit is so much smaller. And it's so much more expensive. Yeah. So spend your money on the cheaper, safer dollars because you can get way better slime. Or just save your money and buy your own supplies and make it for cheaper. So that's it for today's video. We hope you guys enjoyed watching this. Make some more slime. Comment down below if you want some more slime videos. And if you want to make some more like slime kits, tell us which ones. We'll see you guys next time. Bye. Bye.
