 In a couple months I'm going to be able to go on a vacation while be pumping like crazy. I think it's just important to have your own personal free time with friends outside of the house just for sanity of being a parent. Obviously we love to spend time with each other but we understand that we both need our time away and however we want to use it. It's just reassuring to me knowing that we're on the same page with being able to do things outside of the home. While I am gone then you can feed the babies. Having breast milk available is really helpful and he seems to love it.
