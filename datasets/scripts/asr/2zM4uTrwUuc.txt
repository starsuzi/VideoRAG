 This drink is what made America and the world fall in love with vodka. The Moscow Mule made popular by celebrities in Hollywood, it caught on like wildfire. And what I really like about this drink is the tradition of it. The fresh lime, the mug, the ginger beer, and of course the vodka. Gather up your ingredients. I'm going to show you how to make a Moscow Mule. We're going to begin by icing the mug. The reason why we do this first is we want to create a condensation around the mug, make the glass nice and cold. Next, we'll go to the lime. This is going to give the cocktail some really, really nice citrus notes. Fresh lime is always the best way to go. Followed by the gray goose. One and a half parts. And then next, we'll add our ginger beer. And I really, really enjoy ginger beer. Give some really nice spice notes, mingling with the citrus. Give it a nice stir. Again, making the drink colder. Mix in the ingredients. And finally, as a garnish, we'll do another piece of lime. The Moscow Mule. Enjoy.
