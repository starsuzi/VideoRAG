 The grandma and granddaughter cooking shows. Oh my Jesus! We need to have a half a cup of butter or margarine and melt it. And we'll put it onto melt while we do the rest. Go girl. Tip that into that. Hey, stuck. Excellent. Next, we usually mix something with our margarine. And what do we mix? For the syrup. For the syrup. And if we have a half a cup of butter, we need to have two tablespoons of gold and syrup. Are you ready? Hold your tablespoon measure. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Another tablespoon. Mine's going to taste better a bit. Oh yeah, yours will taste better for sure. Now that will be able to melt while we do the rest. Which two are on? Okay, we'll add in. And they will melt nicely. Mix oats, flour, sugar and coconut together. Here is the oats. One cup. Next, what's on the recipe after oats? Let's have a look. One cup of plain flour. Now we've got the siftery out, but because it's anj, we won't worry about using sifters. No need. A plain flour. One cup. Excellent. Okay. Is that more? Now it says a cup of sugar. We don't usually put quite that much. I'm going to take that over and give you butter a little bit of a stir. Yep, melting well. Yep. Okay, back we go now and get the sugar. Okay, now it says a cup, but we'll do about three quarters. Got that. Okay, that'll do. Yep. Excellent. Now we haven't put the oven on. We only want to slow oven to these. Yeah. I'll put that on in the oven. So we've done oats, flour, sugar, three quarters of a cup of desiccated coconut. So we want to set the full cup, three quarters of a cup. All right, I've turned our oven on. Put it on about 150. Okay. We've mixed our oats, flour, sugar and coconut together. Pinch of salt, love. How all the salt in? Mm-hmm. Okay. So all mixed in and ready. We have to organise and boil the water. And now what? A little spray on our trays. I'm going to shake the cooking oil up. Shake it, girl, shake it. Do you think it will be tasty and good? Yes, I do. Mix soda with boiling water and add to your melted butter and syrup. Half a teaspoon to a tablespoon. See, there's your cup soda. And here's the tablespoon. I'm doing the boil in the water because I didn't want you to have to touch it. You hear what you're doing? Sizzling. Fizzling, yep. Okay, you ready? You can tip that all in. It's simple, isn't it? Okay. Oh no. If you're not going to touch it, you tip it in. Are you ready? Now I'll have to turn it over. Yeah, you're all, you're everything mixed together well. Turn your bowl around a bit more. Come on, that's an excellent one, honey. Oh, do you turn it to how you like it to do it? See how grandmas is? No flour. No sugar. Nothing but biscuit mix. Okay, now we'll just double check that everything went in. Oats, flour, sugar, coconut syrup, margarine, cabsoda, boiling water, and salt, all done. And there's your tray. Here's my tray. I'm going to go get my spoon, go like that, and then go, wow. All right, so the my tray is ready to go in. Put in for about 15 minutes. Got a little bit of space in between them in case they sprue. Yep, it's in here now. Oh gosh. You're going over. Happy with those to going. You want to come and look at how they're going in the oven before you take it off. Can you see them? Yeah, cooking. You think they're going okay? Yeah. That the end of our cooking. Thank you. Miss Assistant.
