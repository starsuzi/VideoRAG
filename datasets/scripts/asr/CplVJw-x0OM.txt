 Hi everyone and welcome back to my channel today. I'm gonna be fixing my couch. I don't know if it's gonna work but we're gonna try. There was a lady on Facebook on one of these DIY groups. Don't worry about the jumping. That's Ella next to me in her jumper route. And she bought some stuff enough of Amazon and her couch looks like brand new so I'm gonna give it a go. My couch is horrendous I'll show you. This is how thin my seats are and they're that bad I've even got wood underneath to hold them up. So I haven't got high hopes but at 18 pound let's give it a go. It's a bit balloony but I think over time that that will actually like settle down because even since we've done it they've actually settled down a bit so I think it's gonna go all right. Obviously you can still see the wood but that's to stop the springs from collapsing underneath so they're gonna have to stay but the cover of it is like a big giant marshmallow so I'm pretty happy with that. So I hope you like this video and if you did please give it a big thumbs up and I'll link down below where we got the stuff from and I'll see you soon. Bye!
