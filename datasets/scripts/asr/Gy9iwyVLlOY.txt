 Hey how you doing there it is Dave all red the real bar man today I'm gonna show you how to make a chocolate martini my way there's a few different ways to make them just like a lot of cocktails it depends on where you're at what bar are you working in the traditional way is kind of good I have a chocolate lecora cream de coco vodka just shake it up like that and strain it some people won't add cream to that some people like you vanilla vodka there's a variety of ways to do that some bars don't have a good out of a chocolate I'm gonna show you my take on it it's not the traditional way to make a chocolate martini but whenever I serve it is very well received people love it most be ordered by women I don't get a whole lot of men or in chocolate martinis so here we go I'm gonna show you how I make my chocolate martini with the ingredients we have first thing you want to do when someone orders a chocolate martini when you're making it my way it's getting icing to a martini glass we want to chill the martini glass unless you keep them in a chiller already and we want the glass cold because we're gonna put a little chocolate at the bottom of it we'll chop this world and we want some sticks of the glass if it's room temperature or warm it's all just gonna run to the bottom it looks like crap so get some ice in there right away and let's start here so this is how I make mine and I use vanilla vodka I like vanilla vodka and it gets it that it goes with the chocolate really well so we're gonna use an ounce of vanilla vodka we're gonna use about a half ounce of Irish Le Corbe and we're gonna use about three-quarter of an ounce of frangilica which is actually hazelnut le Corbe has really nothing to do with chocolate but it works so well in here and then touch of cream or actually I'll use whipped cream in there sometimes it has a little of sweetness to it but right now we'll just use some cream not too much about an ounce ounce and a half and then we're gonna put a little Hershey Serpent there I know it's kind of cheating I know some of you might be freaking out because it's not a pure but we don't use too much of this we just drizzle a teeny bit in there maybe a quarter of an ounce not even that just like a dash of chocolate Serpent so get that little chocolateiness in there and then we're gonna shake it up gonna shake this good cream in the chocolate in there you really want to shake it mix it up like chocolate milk shake that up good now our routine glass should be ready dump the ice out we want to get all the water out the all the milk that I water the one in there so I can take a little napkin I get all of the water out of there now it's nice and chilled and we like our chocolate syrup a little bit chilled too if I like it if it's too warm it comes out really fluid you want it a little bit cold and then we just go back and forth and you can see that that's how we do the bottom of the martini glass and now we're just gonna strain it nice creamy chocolatey that is the chocolate martini now you can also garnish this it's great if you have like some chocolate you can shave on there you can little shaver and put some chocolate shavings on there that's awesome if you want to get really flamboyant you put some whipped cream on there put like a Hershey kiss on top or it ain't meant something like that so there's a variety of ways you can make it variety ways that you can garnish it that's the way I make mine and it's good all right I am Dave all right the real barman I'm out visit me at the real barman.com for more cool stuff
