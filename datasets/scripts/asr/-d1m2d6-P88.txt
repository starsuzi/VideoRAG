 Hi, welcome to Best Drink Recipes. I'm Eli Amountroy and now we're going to make the hairy navel not to be confused with the fuzzy navel. Our hairy navel contains vodka that was the fuzzy navel doesn't. We're going to put in 1.5 ounces of vodka, half an ounce of peach snops and the rest orange juice. So in our Collins glass, I already filled with ice. Let's put in our vodka. Followed by the peach snops, lastly, but not least, the green tea. This comprises our hairy navel. We're going to garnish with an orange wheel and this is a delicious treat. Thanks for watching Best Drink Recipes. See you next time.
