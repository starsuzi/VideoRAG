 Oh got it! Good afternoon, it is a beautiful day in Texas and we just found out it's National Roller Coaster Day. Which is convenient because today we are at 6 flags over Texas thanks for answering Jake. Thought maybe we'd cut to it or something. We're gonna have a lot of fun, they hooked it up with some VIP front of line passes and some free food so it's gonna be a good day. Before we hit up any rides, it's gonna be a view of the whole park. We're going up to the oil dare. Alright, we know it's not Wednesday but while we're up here on the observation deck, why not break a world record? We're gonna try a highest distance to drop a hot dog into someone's mouth while riding a roller coaster. We would have been so easy to dang it. Shoot. It sucks that that's there. Okay, so for safety reasons we are not allowed to take a camera on any of the rollercoasters. It's understandable. But we're still gonna make it fun and we're actually gonna start off today's video with our challenge. So, heading to Carnival. Rock vs. Seahoe Glitz first. Dang it. Jakes first. Two, one, go. Oh. Oh, struggling with the arrow. Oh my gosh. No, no. Oh. Dang it. Oh, look. That is everything. No, oh you got it. Look at it. Oh, Carnival. Oh. Carnival. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, 37 seconds. Alright, I don't know what to think. I think I did well. Oh, thank you. Wanna say it's a pretty good score. I'm a little nervous. Not gonna lie. I think it's all gonna come down to archery. If you could do archery well, you'll have it. Ready, set, go. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. There it is. Oh. Got it. Oh. What is it? I think it is very, very close. I don't know. I... Oh, wow. Might have a very close tie on her hands. A pine for the review. Moments later. I told you, I don't want to go on any of the big rides. I get really nervous. I don't want to throw up. I don't want to throw up. I don't want to throw up. I don't want to throw up. I am really nervous. I don't want to throw up. Yaaaaahh!! I want to... Yaaaaahh!! That's one of my styles. Get my subscribers. Yeah. There we go. I got a quad channel. Thank you. Yeah. Fuck's. I'm gonna have to rest a week to answer what I'll be. I'll tell you. Hi guys, it's my friend. How have a good rest of the day, okay? Good, good. That's cool. It's the first ride of the day. Superman. I think I'm pronouncing that correctly. Flash guys, baby. There I am. Okay, there I am. Woo! Okay, first ride down. Pretty good. Had my head looking down when it started. So, I'm fine. Jake gets really happy on rides. That's nice. Nothing's never angry, but you were like a little school boy. Josh, you could win a fidget spinner. Oh my gosh. Or you can buy yours at jugglingwarehouse.com. We just left the hall of justice. Where we saved the day with Superman and Batman. But we're sorry that you guys can't come with us on these rides. But Jake, explain that ride to them only using noises. That was good. Thanks, dude. Woo! Go! And then, if it noise was English, it would be top 5% of all time. What's what my score was. Jake, Jake, BV. Yeah, this wasn't today's challenge, but Jake did beat me in the scoring of the shooting. You used to have a big, colloduty face. Once you get to 25k on YouTube, you have to walk in a separate area so the fans don't get to you. Justin, my man, tell me about Batman. You have it written before? Hello, darkness, my old friend. I'll tell you when I get done, how it is then. I'll let you do the rankings. I'm going to talk about my stomach. Alright, just rode Batman after our lunch. Our free lunch, thanks, Six Facts. And I would say, I would call it a rumble in the jungle after that. Yeah, you feel your chicken nut gnawing? It's definitely different than all the other ones, for sure, because you're a feater dangling. And we rode it the very back, you couldn't see what was coming out. Now, that was the weirdest part, as you can't see, with the head of you. So, it's pretty hot out here, so time for Mr. Freeze. Thank you, you're good, this is all time, it's all about time. Like it. Next morning. Oh, 46% chance, Jake throws up on his ride. Feeling a little bit...it's tough because we have the flash pass, so you don't wait in line. Just bang, bang, bang roller coasters. Got to do the Joker. Where you are flipping. Yeah, let's show you. But you're not stationary while you're riding it. Like your seat is moving. You're doing flips while you go through a roller coaster. So my puke land right in there, probably. Josh, right hand blue. Good. I've never done a roller coaster like that before. It's like there's like a fourth dimension of you moving, which made Josh Giggle like the actual Joker. Like this clip right here. That's what Josh sounded like. Honestly, I don't think we're riding to do this. I've never done a Gainer before, but I bet that's what it feels like. Like a Gainer? Is that a Gainer? No. Alright, another clip. Alright, six flags. Thanks for having us on National Roller Coaster Day, too. Yes. Lotta fun. Lotta fun. Lotta sweat. Lotta rumbles in the jungles, but we made it through. Pute Count still lets you row, baby. We won still, but you don't know. So here's the current score. Thanks for watching our one new video coming every single day this month. We will see you soon. Bye. Oh, I just remembered giveaway.
