 Hi, my name is Lindsay Weiner and I'm from Style Me ASAP. I am an image consultant and personal stylist and I'm going to show you how to remove Lint from clothing. Lint is annoying. It's unsightly and can ruin the look of any outfit. So here are some quick and easy tips on how to get rid of it. First, I suggest investing in a Lint roller. You can find these at the drug store or any grocery store out there. So they're easy and very simple to use. All you do is take this and roll it across the item like this. Keep on doing it until all the Lint is gone. Once this is filled and it's no longer sticky, remove it and use another strip. Keep on doing it until it's gone. If you don't have a Lint roller though, another great tip to use is tape. All you do is take the tape, wrap it around your hands a couple times to create the same stickiness that you would get from a Lint roller. Once you do that, it's the same thing. Attack the Lint with the tape. Just go across and once the tape is in sticky and if there's still more Lint, just do it again. For sweaters, a lot of times not only do you get Lint but also Pilling on the sweaters. So a great way to remove it is to lay the sweater out flat and take a Pomestone. What you do is very gently go across the item with the Pomestone and remove the Lint. If this doesn't work, you also can get a disposable one blade razor blade. This will take out any of the Pilling. You lay out the sweater flat and very carefully because you don't want to rip it. Just take the razor blade across the material and this will remove all the Pilling and Lint. That is there. So here are four easy ways to remove Lint from clothing. Thanks so much. I'm Lindsay Weiner and this is how to get rid of Lint.
