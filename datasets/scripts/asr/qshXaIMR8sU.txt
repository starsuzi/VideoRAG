 Okay, so these are the straps from the MLT system and some of them, you know, that's some thin set on them and they need to be cleaned up. There's one, it's got quite a bit of thin set on it. Now you can scrape these off to clean them up. But someone actually suggested an easier way and that is to throw these in a bucket and put some white vinegar on it and they should come out as clean, let them soak and then they should come out clean. So that's what I'm going to do. So I got those in the bucket and I just got some white vinegar here. So I'm going to pour white vinegar. Let's pack it in a few more here. See there, a little thin set on them. I'm just going to let them sit overnight. Let's see how they come out. Okay, so this is the next day and I pour the vinegar back into the bottle there. And use it for next time and we'll see how they made out. So I can save this for next time, don't have to throw it away. I don't have to, more I will but we can see that. Alright, it's done. I'll try it now, watch the drive now, you do the plastic there. Perfect Perfect? Nevermind, I know So let's say you clean the front, we have a thing like brand new. Okay so as you can see it came out perfectly clean. Anything that was maybe left on there was really just one that had a little bit on there and it just rubbed right off with my finger. Didn't have to scrub or anything. It just came right off. Perfectly clean like the brand new.
