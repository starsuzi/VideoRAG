 Are you aware that there is residue and odors that build up in the brewing chamber of your Nespresso coffee machine? This area cannot be cleaned by a usual cleaning and descaling procedure. Coffee NU has a simple solution, a cleaning capsule just like your coffee capsule that you insert into your machine as you normally would to make your coffee. At the press of a button, the powerful cleaning agent is delivered directly into inaccessible areas, releasing a unique forming action inside the brewing chamber that gets rid of all residue build up in just two minutes. This new way of cleaning is 100% safe using an agent made from biodegradable and organic materials. With regular use it will make your machine last longer and ensure you get the perfect cup of coffee every time.
