 Hi, Tristan McGulfa-Share, Tracy Soes. Today I am altering a wedding gown. I am hemming and cutting the tool. I got a couple tips for you to help you. Make it a little easier if using things I've learned along the way. So we've got tool here. It needs to be cut nice and straight. It's really hard to cut it straight. It's really choppy. So the best thing to do is get some serrated scissors. That'll help grab and hold the tool. Now the next thing is, it's really hard to see. You can't even hardly even see that it's choppy. That can be at your advantage a little bit, but if they're paying good money, they're going to take a close look at the work that you did. And if I lay it on my ironing board, I can't see it at all because it's white. So my other tip is to take a piece of dark material, lay your tool over it, and then you will clearly be able to see that that line is jagged and how to cut it straight. So that's about it. Altering, wedding, and tool to the season. If you want to have a class or a group lesson, I teach all over Dayton. I can do a private lesson. I usually do about one a week. So hit me up. My name is Tracy McGill. Fresh. My website is Tracy Sewing Studio, TRACY Sewing Studio. So connect. Thanks. Bye.
