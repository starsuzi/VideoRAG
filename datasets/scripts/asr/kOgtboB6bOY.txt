 So we are redoing some chairs. I'll show you what they look like. Right now we're just sanding off all the gloss. You can't kind of rough up the edges. I'm just going to dust it off with a dry rag. I'm going to sand down a piece of cardboard. Right now I'm using a flat-on polymaster in the polyrublution breeze. I'll just sand down a piece of cardboard. I'll sand down a piece of cardboard. Okay now it says hold it 68 inches from surface. See this is quick. Ah it's windy. Ah it's windy. No it's windy so the wind's coming. The paint's coming in. That stinks. Maybe I should close the door. For the wind's blowing off of the direction of the ladder. It's not all the way. Yeah it's windy. I'll show you what it looks like when I'm done. This is what I've got. I think I might be done spraying this one. Do you want more paint? Alright so the second one is done now. So now I have to wait for it to dry. It says it dries within 10 minutes and to wait an hour before handling. Hello it's the next day. Now I'm just putting the seats back onto the chair. There's like staples there. So I should just hold it right back in place. If I just push down it will go back in. Alright that's what these look like. This is one that I haven't done yet and this is the ones that I did. So there's kind of a before and after.
