 The Liza Acton's recipe for roasting a turkey ends with an injunction to make sure you serve it with a really good bread sauce. So thought I better follow her. Start by chopping up our onion shell off. It's very fine. And that's going into the saucepan with a pint of milk. It's just simmering until the onion has gone completely soft. I've got to strain the milk onto the bread crumbs. Now I'm straining it so that the onion bits don't end up in the sauce. It's just the onion flavoured milk that has gone into the bread crumbs. Now I'm to leave this to stand for an hour for the bread crumbs to absorb all the liquid. The bread sauce has stood for him now. It's full of thickening and softening. The recipe now calls for us to give it a good old stir. Now I'm going to season it. I'm going to start with my care about half a teaspoon. A little bit more of a teaspoon of care. And salt to taste. Finally about an ounce of butter. And let's all go into the saucepan. I've been given one last boil. Just to let the butter melt and move all the way through. With a turkey carved last thing to do. Let's go to my bread sauce. Here we go. A perfect bread sauce for the perfect Victorian roast turkey. To find the full recipe, visit the website at bbc.co.uk forward slash Victorian Christmas.
