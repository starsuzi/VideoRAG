 Making other people feel good is really important just as human beings, but I also think that a lot of times we overlook the most important person which is ourselves. If we don't take care of ourselves and put ourselves first, then we're going to be putting other people first and that's not a good thing because we're going to start compromising and we're going to start losing who we are. And so I think it's really important to make time for yourself. Everyone needs different amounts of time, different types of time. For example, I love what going and playing for is by myself watching movies, just going for a walk. You need to learn what you need. Trying different things, some people up to do yoga, some people will go for breakfast by themselves, go for a walk, go to their favorite place and just sit there and think. And somebody needs something different, but for example, I went to a movie tonight by myself, watched Jason Born, which is a pretty good movie. And there's only about 15 people, maybe not even in a theater. So it's really, really important. I like to say take yourself on a date. So if you have a boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, whatever, a lot of people and at least people that I know, really good couples will schedule a date night once a week, once every two weeks. And so not a bad idea to schedule a date night for yourself. So I think that's really important to realize that. And it's easy to lose sight of that, I think, getting busy, getting caught up, or social people, or social animals. And so we really like being around other people. But I think at least for me, especially I'm an extroverted introvert, I like to say. And I know that I recharge when I buy myself and I have my long time. And yeah, so just something to think about. Hope you had a great day.
