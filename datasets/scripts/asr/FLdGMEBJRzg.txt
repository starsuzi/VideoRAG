Gooseberries, fruit boxes in general, I tell you what, gooseberry fuel, a few gooseberries with a little cream, it's got to be good, that's how they come nicely packaged and if the weather's really felt I mean winter February now and I think the worst is over but if the weather's really felt they'll keep perfectly well in there it's in wrapped in damp paper and covered in plastic but as soon as you get them into a bucket as soon as you're ready for planting into a bucket give them a good soak overnight it's best I mean look at that root structure that tells you everything you need to know about this plant this will race away go to a nice size bush good three-foot tall good meter very very thorny but super luscious fruit it's called Invicta it's a new variety because with the overrides is what they suffered with was a milled-u a fungus disease and used to get that white bloom onto it what you've got to do is keep an open shape of the bush and it really is as simple as that again well-prepared soil we put plenty in I've done right on the top just need the thing plant some slow release fertilizer now this is just at the top just on the top inch you too because what will happen is that'll dissolve take its nutrients with the rain and with nature we'll take the nutrients down into the bush itself it'd give it a good start firm it really well in you don't want any air pockets down there firm it really well in and I tell you what goose bifool goose bifurc and custard it's might not be a first choice but it's a wonderful choice this is called Invicta new variety disease resistant all you have to do really and truly now is trim these back outward facing buds and create if you can a nice cobblet shape that allows the air to circulate stops the milled-u forming at all and you'll have some beautiful beautiful goose resin that just gonna plant another two now this Invicta is a green variety as most of them are just standard big luscious fruits beautiful thing this hin on maki red and hin on maki yellow again lovely fruit lovely color hin on maki red and yellow and a beautiful luscious green or Invicta one last tip water it give them all a good water and you've done all your duty then all you've got to do going to get a bowl from the kitchen and a spoon and wait for summer
