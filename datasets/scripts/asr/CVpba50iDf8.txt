 Welcome to the Sunday Gardener. It's a lovely May day in late spring and the Wisteria is in full bloom and it's a glorious sight. This Wisteria was planted in May 2007 and in ten years you can see the extent to which it has grown. Wisteria is a very vigorous climbing plant and to get into flower with two basic tips. The first one is to buy a plant in May when it's in flower and then you know it can flower. The other is about pruning. For Wisteria to flower it needs to be pruned twice a year in summer and in winter. On the Sunday Gardener website there's lots of information about how to grow and plant Wisteria and on the YouTube channel there are videos on how to prune it and it's pruning which is most important. Friend of mine said to me recently that they had a Wisteria that was growing really well. Lots of growth but it wasn't flowering and the reason for that is not pruning it in the right way or often enough. Because a Wisteria is so vigorous if you let it grow it puts all its energy into leaves and shoots and it doesn't flower and when you prune it what you're doing is you're constraining the growth and forcing it into flower. So if you want to get your Wisteria to look like this which is truly a lovely site go to the website Sunday Gardener to the YouTube channel. There's lots of advice on how you can plant and grow your Wisteria. It is a fantastic climbing plant to grow and for the best tips and advice on how to grow it and how to prune it Sunday Gardener website. One of the things I can't convey in this video is the wonderful perfume of the Wisteria. It has a fantastic scent planting it on a wall near Patio is ideal so you can smell it on the patio and enjoy it's wonderful perfume particularly on a warm summer's day and summer's evening and good luck with your growing.
