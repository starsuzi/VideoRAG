 Hi, I'm Mitch Ruy with American Metal Filters Company and today I'm going to show you how to clean your range of filter. When it comes time to wash your range of filter, all you have to do is soak it in a combination of hot water and simple green for about 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, gently scrub the filter to remove the grease. A little grease left over is okay because it will help retain the kitchen grease. The only thing you got to remember is don't wash filters with a polysorb carbon material because it will deteriorate. Only the aluminum metal mesh filters are washable. We recommend that you wash your aluminum metal mesh filters off as possible to prevent grease buildup. Too much grease will cause a decrease in air flow. But if you're about to boom, now you get a clean air filter.
