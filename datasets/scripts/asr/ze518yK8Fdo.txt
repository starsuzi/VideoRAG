 We're at Cape Omanor College in Greater London. Head of Horticulture and Landscaping Tom Cole is going to show us how to water house plants. Step 1. Winter Water Insert your finger into the soil at the pot's edge. If the soil feels dry, then water the plant. If it is damp, wait a little longer. This is only a general rule. The need for watering can vary greatly from plant to plant. You can also tap the pot. If you hear a hollow sound, it may well need watering. Plants can sense the natural shortening of daylight hours and may go dormant, so water less in the winter months. Step 2. Watering Allow your water to reach room temperature by leaving it to stand for a few hours. This avoids shocking the plants. House plants with tough foliage and strong stems require watering from above. Use a watering can without a rose attachment and apply directly to the soil surface. Leave for a few minutes and water again until the water drains out the bottom of the pot. Avoid watering on the plant's foliage as this can cause limescale. Step 3. Watering from below Soft, sappy plants such as Cape Primrose, Bagonius and most succulents should be watered from below. Simply pour the water into the dish that the pot is set in. If it is absorbed quickly, then top up by half. Step 4. Earn plants Earn plants such as bromeliads should be watered directly into the crown of the plant. Pour water into each crown so that it pulls in the earn. Only a small amount of water being needed for each. If you were to water at the base of the plant, it would simply rot. Done.
