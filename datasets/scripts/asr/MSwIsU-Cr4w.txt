 Welcome to Guils and Tails. On this channel you can expect to see all sorts of videos on how to care for your pet rat or hedgehog. Before I tell you anything more I think it's important that I introduce you to me and to my pets. So hello my name is Jessica and I have four dogs, two cats, three rats and a hedgehog. You see I love animals and my goal for this channel is to bring you the most accurate and up-to-date information on how to care for your rat or your hedgehog.
