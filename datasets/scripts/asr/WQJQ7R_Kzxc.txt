 Hi, this is Jim Gibson with Creative Painting Water Proofing. I wanted to take just a minute to show you how we cut a straight clean line and a vaulted ceiling against a popcorn ceiling. We have Rhonda Gilder sleeve up there today, and she's running a Purdy 2.5 Pro Extra. And the thing I like about this Purdy Pro Extra is the release from the bristle to the surface. It's quick and smooth. The other thing I really like about it is if you are slightly misaligned when you're cutting in the air correction with this brush as a snap. It's just a good brush, and if the painter knows how to work it, it's excellent results. And one of the other things I really like about this brush is the organ hardwood handle and the rounded ferrules. It just makes the brush seem a whole lot more balanced, and the painter can actually move quicker. But as you see, she cuts a nice straight clean tight line, and there's no paint overrun on the popcorn ceiling. So we just have a great affection for this brush. It's a good brush.
