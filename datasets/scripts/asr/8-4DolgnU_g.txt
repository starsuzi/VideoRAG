 This strawberry tart is absolutely delicious and it's so quick and easy it's on the table in under 15 minutes. I'm going to start with a filling, got some mascarpone cheese here and I'm going to pop that into a bowl. To that I'm going to add some natural Greek yogurt and just give those two a good mix together and because the mascarpone is the thicker of the two you just need to work out any lumps. There we go. And once the mixture is nice and smooth I'm going to add in some lemon curd in that goes. I'm just going to add a little bit of grated lemon zest. Just save a little bit for the top. I've got a sweet pastry case here that I've bought. I'm just going to pour the mixture into there. And then just level it out. And then to finish it off I've got some lovely strawberries here. I'm going to halve some of them, quarter the larger ones and then just slice some of the other ones. And then I'm just going to arrange them across my tart just trying to completely cover the surface and it's a very casual look we're going for so don't worry too much about it. You might like to fan some of the pieces out. However it suits you fancy if you want to be more formal of course you can be with your arrangement. Just a little bit more of that lemon zest. Really really quick and easy. If you've got a bit of time pop it in the fridge for about 20 minutes or so just to help the filling to firm up otherwise just sprinkle a little bit of icing sugar and you're good to go.
