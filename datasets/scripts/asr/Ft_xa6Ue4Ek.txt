 Hey there and welcome to No Red Spirit Quired. I'm Dave and tonight I'm going to show you how to do a a julienne cut on a zucchini. Now really easy to do this is a simple cooking technique but I love showing you the techniques. Knife skills are super important because they're going to speed up your time in the kitchen. Prep time nobody really loves to do it. You get good at it. You can cut it way down. You become a better, faster, safer chef. Let's go ahead and show you how to do it. Okay so in prep for our pasta dish I want to show you how to julienne a zucchini. Same technique obviously works for a piece of squash. I'm going to take off the bottom and the top because there I'm not very good. And then I'm going to cut some planks out of our zucchini. And by planks I just go down the long way about quarter inch thick is what I'm looking to do here. And then essentially I just laid that guy flat. Your first cut is going to be a triangle not so much the julienne but then just keep going at that angle and you end up with these nice little match thick shapes nice and long and then you can you know use them in whatever recipe you'd like. I'll see you next time on the recipe required.
