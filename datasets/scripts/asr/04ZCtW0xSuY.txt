 The most common spill we have on carpet is coffee. How do we take it out if we've had it there for a couple days, weeks, months? However long, once it's set in, here is a quick way to do this. Get a spray bottle with water and spray down the stain. Make sure that the carpet is really damp. Once you do that, get some 3% hydrogen peroxide and generously cover the stain by spraying it on. Now, take a white, clean rig or cloth that is quite wet and place it over the stain folded in half. Place an iron on top and let it steam for about 20 to 30 seconds. What you will find is that the stain will actually come up into the cloth. Be careful not to burn or melt your carpet. The iron hotness is due very. You will start seeing the color come out. Spray more hydrogen peroxide onto the stain. Flip your cloth onto the clean side and repeat. Make sure that your cloth stays wet and fairly clean. Okay, so we've done this for about 4 to 5 minutes now in total. What you're going to find is that there is a residual left and you can still see a bit of shading. What we'll do is rinse it out and the residual of the hydrogen peroxide will fade it out
