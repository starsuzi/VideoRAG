 Hello everyone this is Pisan here and welcome to my channel, Fudan Krabu. Guys if you are in non-vez and if you love to have meat and that also daily but you don't feel like preparing them with everything right then this video is going to be for you because in this video I'm going to show you how to make meat because that way you can store the meat and have them whenever you like you can store them for almost around one month or even more than that so let's go and check out the recipe how to make the meat because okay so here I'm using 1 kilo of meat you can take any kind of meat whichever you like it can be chicken mutton pork beef buff whatever you like the process will be almost similar if it is a red meat then make it whistle for three times if it is not a red meat then make it whistle only for one time so the first thing what we need to do here is whatever meat it is you need to put it inside the pressure to prefer then for one kilo of meat you need to put 250 grams of meat in there and put salt as per your taste and make it whistle for three times after making it whistle for three times let it cool down and then now you can open the lid so by opening the lid now you need to cook this until all the water get dry up you don't need to pour out the water because all the taste of the meat that is in that water so if you pour out the water then the meat will be tasteless so you need to cook until all this water get dry up so that all moisture content in the meat get dry up we need to cook this in high flame now after few minutes as you can see here that the meat is almost dry so now we need to lower the flame and then again cook this after cooking for few minutes now as you can see the color of the meat has been changed into light brown so now it's time to turn off the gas let it cool down in the pressure cooker itself and then now we're gonna heat up the oil in another pan so for making heaters we need lots of oil but the oil it also depend upon the day how long you're gonna store the meat so for suppose if you're gonna store the meat for more than one month then for one kilo you need to put at least 250 ml of oil if you're gonna heat this up within one week then you can just use 150 ml of oil that will be more in sufficient so I'm not gonna store this for long time so I won't be using that much of oil and first we're gonna fry some garlic now after frying the garlic for some time now you can add the meat okay so now we'll put the meat and start frying okay so now we're gonna add one teaspoon of cumin powder one teaspoon of coriander powder one teaspoon of red chili powder or you can go for two spoons also if you if you want to make a little hot but I prefer putting only one spoon of red chili powder because I'm gonna put extra chili here so this way like you need to fry this for almost around five to ten minutes until the color is sent to dark brown after completely cooling it down by taking out in one plate and then like by spreading out the meat now when the meat is completely cool that the time like you can store it in one container any container whichever you like and then like you can put it inside your refrigerator this way like you can use the meat spreading upon almost oil you put like if you're putting the amount of oil with I'm using then you can use this for around ten fifteen days and if you're using more than this then like as I told you if you're using only two fifty amount of oil or maybe something around two fifty a month then you can store this for more than one month so I've all this for the meat here here it is so you can have this whenever you like if you love meat then this way you can have meat whenever you like if you think my video is helpful then please do give me a like and please do subscribe to my channel thank you
