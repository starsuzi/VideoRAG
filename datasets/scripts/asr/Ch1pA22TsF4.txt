 Hi, I'm Shana Jaffee with Everyday Dishes and today we are going to learn how to caramelize onions. Cut the top and bottom off of two onions. Slice the onions lengthwise and now heat one tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Now add the onions and make sure you thoroughly coat with oil. Sate them slowly, stirring about every 10 minutes. Cook the onions 30 to 40 minutes depending on how thick the slices are and how dark you like them. You want to capture the flavor at the bottom of the pan, so we're going to deglaze it with a little bit of liquid. I'm using stock that you can use a possumic vinegar, wine, water, whatever you have. And now, like I always say, taste for seasoning, you're probably going to need some salt and pepper. And there you have it, you've got your caramelized onions.
