 I'm just like I'm eating a tree. Oh my god. Hey good morning guys. It's actually evening again, but welcome back to the vlog. Today we're gonna check out the okra because it is huge. Hey and Seth is out here too. I was looking for him just a second ago, Seth. I was calling your name all over the house. I couldn't find you anywhere. Hi. You got here doing your yard work? Yeah. It's looking good. Wow, look at that. So you got this one like this. This is not clean yet, right? Nope. Then you got over there all over here. Look at that. It's beautiful Seth. Hey can you give me a hand please? We're just gonna cut some okra. Will you hold the ball? Yep. Alright so we're going to harvest our okra. I think some of these might just be way too big and too hard. Look at the size of that one right there. It's huge. Alright so let's go ahead and clip all these guys. Alright guys, look at the okra. I mean we've got some monsters in here. Let's kind of separate them out a little bit here by size. See which ones are going to be good and not good. That's probably the biggest, ooh maybe that's the biggest one right there. I don't know but there's some big ones in there. Probably too big. Probably too hard. How's that? That looks good. Oh yeah. Alright so those are all of our sizes right there. I'll show you how we cut them. And then we're going to batter them with this. And then we're going to deep fry them in that. And then we're going to see how it comes out. Jules made the batter up for us here. So we're going to go with that. We need to cut them bored enough. Alright so we've got the biggest one here. Wow. Wow, cut that guy open. Wow look at that. Huh. Thinking. That it's going to be too hard. What do you think Jules? That sounds pretty hard huh? Yeah, they're not supposed to be that hard. They're old. Yeah. So like looking there you can see that. That looks pretty cool huh? But it is pretty hard. So you guys heard that. That's the big one there. We'll cook that guy up and see how it comes out. And then we'll cook up one of these little guys here. Oh that's so soft. That's going to be juicy. Look at that. Yeah. That's so much better than supposed to be soft. Yeah you guys can totally hear the difference. I'm sure. We'll cook up a couple more of these little ones too because they're small. Yeah that's about the right size right there. Yeah. The other ones were kind of turning into monsters. It's pretty woody. Those big ones. Alright so we got the big one. We got the little ones. We'll go ahead and cook them up and see how they taste. Alright go ahead and pull these guys out. Put them on paper towel. Now we'll put the little ones in there. Mix them all up in there again. Hey Joe's. Can you tell me why is this better like a little bit brown or like has spots in it? Coriander. Coriander. Yeah. Okay. I didn't know. Coriander, black pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, rice flour and wheat flour. Wow. That's a lot of stuff in there. And then water. Alright we're going to call these guys down here. Put them on the paper plate. Yeah. Or the paper towel. That's a big difference in size. Yeah. Way big kind of. Wow. Taste test? Taste test. But first I got to cool down a minute I think. Alright guys. So they've cooled down a little bit. They might still be pretty hot but hopefully the big ones will be ready to eat. Joe's you're going to try one? Yeah. Alright. There you go. One for you? Ooh that's hot still. I think it's too hot still. You want to go first? Be careful. The batter's good. Who's that? Is that it? That's good? Not good huh? I just like eating a tree. Alright so Joe says it tastes like she's eating a tree. Wow. Hmm. Huh. Alright so the flavor on the big ones was good but when you chew it it's like it is like wood. I mean super woody, super fibrous like you might get a splinter in your mouth almost that bad. So you don't want to let them get that big okay? Now these guys are the little ones. Just? A little one for you. So when you said the flavor was good you mean the batter was good? No I mean the flavor of the okra was good. Alright. I thought. Alright. That's good huh? That was great. That's the way it should be. The seeds are little slimy still. It's really good. Soft. Yeah, too bad we let them get too big. We'll keep producing. Yeah it's true. Alright let's go ahead and try a small one here. Yeah. Mmm hmm. That's exactly right. That's good. Good. So good. So good. These guys have never tried fried okra. It's really good. Make sure you get them in the small. If you buy them in the store of course they're going to be the right size. But yeah just a bad room and chop them up with the little pieces and do from for a minute or two. Use a batter like you would for making temp√©. That would be perfect. For the folks in Indonesia. Yeah for the folks in Indonesia. What about in America? In America you probably already know how to fry temp. Fry okra. It's true. Or you can just buy it frozen ready to fry. Yep. Do that too. Well guys that is going to do it for today. If you want to know more about what it's like to live in Indonesia. The places, the go, the things to do, the food to eat.
