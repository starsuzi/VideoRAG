 August 1st is Swiss National Day marking Switzerland's independence from Austria. Hi, I'm Rebecca Brayton and welcome to WatchMojo.com and today we'll be making a traditional Swiss recipe fondue. Each region in Switzerland has a unique and traditional recipe for fondue, either by adding different cheeses or by adding a variety of different ingredients. Here are the ingredients you'll need for a basic and traditional fondue. 1 clove of garlic, 1.5 cups of dry white wine, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 2 cups of grated emmental, 2 cups of grated gruyere, 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, paprika, pepper, and nutmeg to taste, 3 tablespoons of kyrsch and French bread. First step, rub a heavy saucepan or an earthenware pot, refer to as a caclon with the garlic clove. Now, warm the wine and the lemon juice being careful not to let it boil. The lemon juice helps to break down the cheese, which will make for more homogenous fondue. Next, add the cheese slowly, stirring constantly in a figure eight. If you stir it in a circular motion, you run the risk of your cheese boiling up. When the cheese boils, add the mixture of kyrsch and cornstarch. The cornstarch helps keep the cheese from separating. And cook for a couple of minutes. Finally, season to taste with paprika, pepper, and nutmeg, and serve with French bread cubed, or an assortment of vegetables. Don't forget, if you drop your bread in the cheese, you have to kiss the person on your left.
