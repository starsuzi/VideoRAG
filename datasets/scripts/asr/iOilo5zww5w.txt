 It is a hot one outside. But is the temperature hot enough to bake cookies? I say no, but my boss says yes. The only way to know who is right is through a cage-cue-a experiment. So what we're using to bake these cookies isn't your oven. It's your car. These cookies are supposed to bake in a 325 degree oven for 15 minutes, but the big boss seems to think a few hours in the back seat of this car will do. But there is one other place we can put a tray. Let's see how hot it gets in the trunk. It's about 10 o'clock now, so we'll come back in a few hours to see if our cookies are baking.
