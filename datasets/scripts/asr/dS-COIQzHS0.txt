 What's up guys and welcome back to them gonna be making a light box So if you if you want to turn your photos into professional looking shots whether you're shooting for social media You're shooting for products who shooting your own creations. You're shooting food any of those things This can get you there if you've never heard of a light box It's basically a miniature studio that will be pumping light into to get light on your subject And before I dive into the bill I have some exciting news to share with you guys today is the official launch of the DIY creators merch If you want to check that out. I have a link down in the video description We got 12 products to choose from if you want to support what I do That'll be great. We appreciate it allow me to keep doing this and let's get started To get started I'm gonna set up at the Miter saw this is a simple bill you can use a circular saw and you can also use a Miter box with a hand saw now of course those two options are gonna take a little longer once all my pieces are cut to an End I laid them out and made a quick count to make sure I had everything done and as you see at the top of the screen Those are all the pieces of scrap that I had left over so this was a pretty efficient cut to simplify this whole process I basically made a bunch of frames and to simplify this I'm gonna use butt joints and pocket hole screws I'm worth the wood so that I knew exactly where I wanted to drill the holes I looked at multiple option when it come to making these frames and I thought about half-flap joints and I also thought about using dolls But the pocket hole screws were the easiest to get done I want to keep in mind you're not necessarily stuck with using pocket holes If you have a thing against those you can use whatever joiner you need to Now since I was repeating a lot of these I decided to create a quick jig that I can easily just Slam the pieces of wood together and install the pocket hole screws now this jig worked out really well and it really kept everything Aligned and made it quick for me to just go ahead and focus on securing pieces of wood together Once I got the first one done I just repeated the same process until I was able to duplicate everything else I ended up with two outside trims two sides a top and a back along with the front and this piece I'm gonna attach to the back for structural support A buddy of mine on Instagram sent me a few of these metal squares and they really come in handy and I'll put a link to that down in the Video description and if you're not following me on Instagram Go ahead and follow me at more DIY creators And I was time to assemble the frames to each other I'm gonna square these up first and then I want to make sure that the sides that the pocket holes are actually facing out I'll add another piece of trim to cover those Once I get everything lined up I installed a few Brad nails to secure the pieces together I envisioned this to be all over the place So it's not strong enough to just use Brad nails So I do recommend using wood glue to get that tighter stronger bond And of course if you don't mind aesthetics you can also use screws with the two side attached I'm now going to install the front and unlike the sides I want to make sure that the pocket hole screws on the front is facing in I'm gonna align everything in a lot of squares in place Then I'll apply wood glue and secure the front on with Brad nails To wrap this section up I'm gonna run wood glue around a perimeter of the top and then place the top trim in place and just like the previous steps I'm gonna clamp these together once they're aligned and attach them with Brad nails Since the outer frame is made of one by two I did notice that the pocket hole screws I have would actually land on the inside of that frame Which would more than likely be seen through the diffusion fabric to address this I'm gonna fill in the hole using wood filler that actually drives closer to color of the wood that I'm using The pocket holes took a good amount of wood filler So to speed up the drying time I used the heat gun. I also use wood filler to cover up the holes from the nails Once the filler dried up it was time to sand. I sand both sides down as smooth as I could get it I needed to make sure that this was a flat surface so that the trim can sit flat I also used a sanded to round over the corners and the edge I marked out for section and then I cut the diffusion fabric now and I'm gonna start off with one of the smaller side first Being that I don't work with fabric that much I was a little caught up on how should I start with side to I start on and I just got tired of wasting time And I just dove in and it's like what's the worst can happen I took it aside at the time and stapled it on as much as I could until everything looked good I then went back and trimmed down the excess so that it didn't stick out past the end I repeated that for both side and then I made my way to the top Securing the top seemed to be a little more trickier because I had limitations on where I could actually place the staple gun I did the best I could and finally I got it and I trimmed off the excess It was actually a good thing about an extra piece of lumber because I needed that so that I can attach this Front on here. This wasn't part of the plan attaching this trim allowed me to hide the loose ends of the fabric To hide the staples and make this more presentable I'm going to attach the final piece the trim I held the trim in place with clamps to make sure that there were no gaps in between I then secured that with brad nails. I did not add glue in the occasion I need to replace the fabric in the future I'll simply remove the trim and replace the fabric to blend the trim better I use wood filler to fill in the gap. I'll go around once again and make sure that I fill in all the gaps and all the nail heads At this point it's pretty much done in a future video I will create interchangeable backdrops photo props and things so we can get the most from this light box I thought it was a good idea to show you a quick miniature Photo backdrop to get the creative juice flowing. I made this one from scrap wood and recycled pallets I'm gonna use these posts in the back as a way of spacing out the floor for the backdrop Once I have them all lined up, I'll nail them in place This one is gonna be temporary. Ideally I want to build one big enough to capture more real estate inside the light box I'm going to leave the back loose which make it easy to break down and also interchangeable This will work well if you want to have a dark floor white wall or if you want to mix different material You can get as creative as you like The beauty of having the light boxes I can be anywhere and all I need is a flat surface to set up I'm gonna use my studio lights. I've had these for about three years now dropping them a thousand times So they've proved to be pretty durable. I'll link those down in the video description All you need is a light source of any kind that's gonna beam some light inside the box For the backdrop I'm gonna be using some of these poster boards that you can use for projects and things of that nature And I'm gonna use that for backdrops and just to give me like a seamless background In most cases your goal is to shine light into this box and get light on your entire subject But it's also great because you can shoot light from one direction Depending on the vision and what you want to actually capture If you're a woodworker or crafter maybe you just love to take photos or you want to shoot photos for a website or product This is really an essential thing to have so you'll be able to get the best photo possible Now with the simple or a backdrop it'll give you an idea on what we can actually capture So I shot a few photos of my lens just to give you an idea how you can make things look like it's in a completely different Environment if you manage to skip the beginning of the video and you made it this far today We're launching the merch So if you want to check that out support the channel I got a link down in the video description Now one thing to keep in mind is that I didn't edit any of these photos They're like right out of the camera. So some of them are probably even bad shots But I just wanted to get you some Ideal and perspective on what you can get with a light box So just remember that all the backgrounds are interchangeable Basically you can do whatever you want in here to create a new environment My initial plan was to leave the back open But then I decided to change my mind because I wanted to have it in a way that it was ready to go at all times I'm gonna glue on a white hard board here, but you can absolutely attach in a material you want So as a bonus, I'm gonna throw in a free cutting list for this project So if you guys want to make this the size on this is 32 inch long by 21 inch deep and about 19 inch tall I'll have that link down in the video description So this is actually gonna be a huge help for me I've always wanted one of these and I think I'll be able to get exactly what I want I think it's gonna be a great addition to my arsenal because I want to be able to improve every aspect I'm more like a hobbyist when it comes to shooting photos So I'm not like a hundred percent invested as a photographer is so this is probably something like a lot of Photographer would be super interested in and if you are a woodworker or you like to sell your products And you have things cutting boards knives things like that that you want to capture and shoot it I think something like this will work out for you so you can capture your best image and Present it to your audience and that is it for today if you're new to this channel I'm Glenn and be sure to subscribe to DLL Creators for all your do-it-yourself projects. I'll see you next time
