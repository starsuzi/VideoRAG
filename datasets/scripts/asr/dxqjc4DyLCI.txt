 It's time to talk about an edgy topic, wicked edgy. Landscape edging. A lot of people use it, but plastic edging is my least favorite. It's hard to install. You have to dig a trench and then push this bob end down into the ground and then stake it in place. But the hide pot is getting it straight. In the winter with a freeze-thaw cycle, the plastic edging can get pushed out of the ground and then you have to reinstall it. It's pretty frustrating. If you're looking for a visible edging, nothing beats a cobblestone or a brick. Some people like to lay the brick in flat, but I like to put them in on the edge. When you tap them down, you can make a nice curve, and when you put concrete behind them, these bricks are never going to move. I also like metal edging. You just dig a shallow trench, lay the steel edging in place, stake it in, and it does a great job of separating a bed from the lawn and when it's done, it's almost invisible. Got it. Of course, the simplest edging is no edging at all. You can use an edging tool like this to make an airspace between your lawn and the bed. As the grass grows out, it'll hit the airspace and stop in its tracks.
