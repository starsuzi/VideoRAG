 It's a sad day in my powered window on my Buick 2001 Century no longer goes up It goes down but not up So this is going to be how I'm going to manually put the window back up to access the door panel You have to first take off this cover right here Just put a screwdriver or something flat in there reveals the two bolts And we'll take those off with a ratchet We also need to pop off the cover for the window switch And this thing You can see the clip on that on the right side towards the front of the car and then you need to disconnect this wire by Pushing down on this little release tab to get the wire out So there that comes you can fish this Down into the hole so that we're going to be able to pull out the rest of the panel To do that you just go around the side and pull out these Tabs that look like this that hold the door in place. So you just kind of have to Work your way around the perimeter of the panel and once you've got it released all the way around the sides here You're gonna pull the whole panel off And but you have to make sure to guide it past this handle here So here the door is There's the inner panel so we're going to have to peel off this plastic insulation And now you peel it peel back to the lower part of this you can see the windshield motor there Disconnected the power wire to that Now we're going to loosen the bolts and hold the windshield wiper motor assembly Just a little bit so then we can slide them up and back through those holes Sorry, just let it up and then I pushed it back now it's loose hanging in there And if you unscrew this metal casing you can see the Rotor the motor and if your cables aren't clogged you might be able to Rotate this to move the window up and down If I take it all the way out and you can see the screw drive in there And because you can't back drive this this is why your window can't be Manually pushed or pulled down My cables were completely gamed up so I ended up taking a drum roll tool and cutting the cable Right right around there and that allowed me to manually Move the window to manually My window up and down There's enough friction to keep it there during typical drive, but I have to Manually pull it up every time I get out of the car. So it's not a good long-term solution So I ended up buying a brand new replacement assembly motor and everything you can't really buy just one part First thing to do is to bring your window down so you can get access to the bolts that attach the mechanism to the window down here So that will take off these little screws This guy And then the window could be pulled up separate from the assembly Now we're gonna take the window up to keep it out of the way and we're gonna do these four screws to Release the assembly And Add it comes to get the new one in we slide it to pick up Put these bolts in here Now for the motor assembly you want to start the bolts first And then you can slide them in through the Larger parts of the holes and then tighten them up Slides right in there There Finally the motor power back up Now we need to bring the window mechanism down so we can get access to the screws that hold the shield on to do that we just Hook up our Button and Drive it down now we take our tape off Bring the window down Tell the screeners line up here We can just Reattach the glass to the mechanism and there we go To put things back together we just put back the water guard And we're gonna put the inner panel back on Take the Switch off first To be able to fish that wire through the door It's a wire All just snap back in place Tell I've never done this before I Final step is just to put these two screws back in the door handle And And there we go
