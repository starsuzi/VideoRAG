Who's that? Who's that? You know, I hear you, right, kitty? Good morning! Guys, kitty kind of slipped yesterday. She kind of heard your little leg because those two icey outside, you're running too fast, kitty. You gotta lay off that leg, kitty. You gotta lay off that leg, girl. How you feeling this morning? You run too fast, that's why, kitty. You run too fast, you'll be okay. You'll be okay, girl. Here we go, guys, Oxtail. So I know a lot of Jamaicans love washing their Oxtail before cooking it or washing them meat before cooking it. I had this washed twice, so one was just a rinse. The second was with lime salt, some vinegar, and the water. All right, so all it is, nice and clean. We're going to do our bow here. I was never a washer, guys. Let's say that, I was never a washer until I ate, I think it was Haitian food, yeah. Roughly around five pounds of clean Oxtail here. So, to the smarrinate, I got some olive oil. I know a lot of you guys don't use olive oil, but I use olive oil just because it's healthier than any other oil, in my opinion, okay? So two tablespoons of olive oil going in, one tablespoon of salt, one tablespoon of soy sauce. So the soy sauce I'm using, it's called, a Maggie seasoning, best soy sauce, I'll say, in my opinion. I have a teaspoon of white pepper, teaspoon of black pepper, a teaspoon of ground coriander, one teaspoon of all spice, half tablespoon of hot chili powder, tablespoon of paprika, or for me guys, just two tablespoons because I like paprika, lay off me. Got a tablespoon of browning sauce from Mrs. Grace. So all it is is cook down sugar, or cook down brown sugar, just a little more. That's a tablespoon of ketchup. I got a bunch of fresh thyme going in. Just gonna dump it in, okay. Next, we got a plate of goodies right here. So, bam, put you guys up. We got one bunch of green onion, one clump of ginger, one whole onion, five pieces of garlic, one whole red pepper, two scotch bonnet. Got my gloves. This is nice and blended. I kind of want it like a mush guys, just because I want all this good seasoning or we're veggies to seep into this ox telly here. So, add this beautiful, make sure I'll top my ox tail. Make sure you wear gloves guys because your hands will burn. All right, move this, nothing to it guys. Get right into it guys. Mix this in very well. Oh man. Get into every single crack of this. All right, just make yourself there. Don't lie to yourself, okay. Don't lie to me, don't lie to yourself. You know this is gonna be good. Use my little twist some take on that guys. It's still a little authentic I'll say. I just add a little extra things in there, but you know it's gonna be good. Everybody's ox tell stew is not the same. Don't come at me with that, okay guys. If it was the same guys, that's it. If it was the same. Well, all right, travel far for the best one guys. Why would I, well, I could just stay here in Canada, right? Because we've been the same, right? I could just have the same recipe and just make it at home. That's all it is guys. Anyone has their twist of take on it. All right, I'm gonna let this marinate for three hours. Minimum before I cook it. Nice guys. Our peas is a peas or beans. I think it's Jamaican's called a peas. So I got, is this lime of beans? I think this is lime of beans. So I got Jamaican anti guys. So she told me to season my water first. So I'm gonna do it with tables going to salt in each. She also told me to throw in some onions just to season the water and garlic. So two piece and two piece each. So first thing, lime of beans into my boiling water here. Is it lime of beans? You know what, I'm just gonna call it Jamaican beans. Keep it on the safe side, all right? Put my Jamaican peas. Beans are peas. Keep it for getting peas. On this side, Jamaican peas. I'm gonna boil this too. You know what, it's my first time ever boiling fresh peas. I was gonna buy the can one. Well, I was kinda wanting to buy the can one, but the other lady there kinda got upset or the lady that was talking to me in the beginning. She kinda got obsessed. She told the other lady that if you buy the ones in the can, they're not seasoned. So I got these ones. So these have been soaking for a whole day, you guys. You know what, if you guys part watching this, like wow, Kwan, that's triggering me right now. Just dump the whole thing in. Don't worry, guys, two piece. And don't worry, guys, this is the one with the first piece, okay? Peas took around 20 to 25 minutes to cook, so I'm gonna do. I got six cups of long grain rice here. I'm gonna take these peas. Guys, just thinking about it now, I'm not sure why my Jamaican auntie gave me these peas. Like these peas are delicious, but I think traditionally, guys, red kidney beans are thrown into the Jamaican rice here. Quote me if I'm wrong, but my Jamaican auntie gave me this, okay? So she's right, don't quote her on it. Fill my water up to that line there. There it is. I'm gonna bam, take this into my rice cooker. All right, we don't need to salt this, just because we had it salted into the water of our beans already, so next to this, our third cup of coconut milk. Mix this in. Throw on the top. I just wanna say this, guys, my tiger. I've gotta use this, there it is. My tiger rice cooker is full of rice there now, so I gotta use aroma. So shout out to aroma gang. Three hours in. Got this pan here. I went through all in, three tables to enough olive oil. I'm gonna put some pan colors, nice and hot. Take my marinated off-tail. Off to the little pool here. All I'm gonna do, guys, brownie side. Once I got my off-tail nice and seared, guys. Oh man, look at that. To my Instant Pot. Isn't that a beautiful view? I say so. I just saw a beautiful. For the reason why I'm throwing in my Instant Pot, because I wanna eat it right away. So we're gonna take me about 20 more minutes, guys, just to cook. Next to this, two cups of water. Now, do it, guys. Take that beautiful lid of yours. Pop it on. And we're gonna cook this for about 20 minutes, guys. That's all it needs. For this pot here, guys, I'm not gonna throw anything out. I'm gonna take my lamin beans and my water. I was gonna duck it in there. I was gonna let this sit and soak for a tad bit. And when this gets cooked, I'm just gonna throw it in here and stew it a little more, just get a little dry. And we'll serve 20 minutes in, guys. I'm letting the air out. So last time, remember the last time I got the Instant Pot, guys? I kinda goofed it and just let the air out in the house. And got all of my cabinets. I'm wiser this time, guys. Now it's outside. Moment of truth for this. Beautiful, off-tailed guys. So I will have to be stewing this a little bit more because I wanna dry it out because there's a little water here, but I got this ready. So, look at that. 20 minutes is just perfect for these. Man, okay. I'm not sure if I wanna dump all this water in or broth in. You know what, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. That's where all the flavor is. Oh man, please, just get out. I'm just gonna reduce this down now, guys. I don't know what to say. It's just a work of art. I got this nice and reduced, guys. Check this out. I haven't even let this even sit for a tad bit. Just let it cool down a bit, guys. Rate my off-tail stew. Jamaicans out there. How did I do? Ow, ugh. Still hot. This thing burnt me. Hahaha. Isn't that a beautiful sight? All right. Peas and rice. Or rice and peas. Got which one I was. I gave my mom some already. That's why you guys see this rice all nice stuff and she loves it. Let's set this up. So, got this beautiful point here. Peas and rice. Oh man. Okay. Is that good? That's good. The best part right here. Let me turn down that brightness for you guys to see. That good Jamaican boxtail stew. Oh man. Nobody better be talking right now. Hahaha. They're not be talking. Just. Be quiet. Oh man. Hahaha. This is my. Twist my take on. Jamaican. Oxel stew with peas and rice. When are you guys going to come by? Quick time guys. Let's do that. First meal of the day. Would you say this is probably the best first meal of the day ever? Alright, the season rice. Quick time guys. Yeah, it's got it. Nice. Pong for this. Oh yeah. That season so well. I want to say this guys. I know traditionally you guys use red kidney beans. But the beans my Jamaican auntie gave me. Hahaha. It's really tasty. Really tasty. I'm not going to question her guys. If you guys want a questioner, go question her. Hahaha. She'll probably give you a lot of heat. Guys, another bite of this. Quick time. That's got it. Nice. Mmm. Rice is seasoned perfectly. Alright, main event. The oxtail. I'm going to grab a good piece for you guys. So you can just suck on the bowl. Okay, it's quick time. Buy this Jamaican oxtail. How did I do that? Quick time. That's got it. Nice. Pong for this. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Mmm. Mmm. Rice. Piece of down with the rice. Quick time. Yes. The beans? Mmm. This is it, chief. Hahaha. Mmm. Oh man. I'm moving this. Put your guys closer. Just right in front of your face. So you guys see what I see. This is it, chief. I ain't kidding. Too close, fam. Hahaha. Alright, just getting a little heavy on my hand. But I do it for you guys. Another piece of this oxtail here. Quick time. Nice. Pong for this. Oh yeah. This, my friend. Is love. Alright, excuse my red cheese, guys. Prior to this, I was doing a Vietnamese video. And I ate octopus. And had a beer. So I'm kind of buzzed out right now. That's nice. Hahaha. Mmm. Just right here, guys. No, what do you want me to say? I'll never buy off-stale at a Chinese place no more. Mmm. Or a western place anymore. I'll always go to a Caribbean place or to make a place here in my city. I search far and wide for this type of cut of oxtail here. Oh yeah. And I finally found it. Nice. My hand is getting tired. But 20 minutes, 20 minutes in the... Mmm. And some butter. It's perfect. It's actually perfect. Not too soft, not too hard, just perfect. How did I figure it out? I just guessed it made. I always guessed it made things. Hahaha. I guess it made things if I put too much one time. Now try it. If I put too less of that, I'll try it. The next time I do it, I know it, right? That's all that is. Look at this oxtail here. It's just perfect. Guys, I'll buy this quick time. Nice. Pump for this. In my opinion, guys, you gotta eat oxal like this. You gotta pick it up. And just go ahead. Mmm. Perfectly seasoned. Perfect amount of everything. Hahaha. Oh, there it goes. I'll repeat myself again, guys. You're gonna say these breasts are not authentic. But my Jamaican auntie gave me these peas here. She guided me to this. I trust her. So if you guys want to come out to me, my Jamaican auntie's ready to bat fire at you guys. Hahaha. Not too amazing. Wow. Look at this piece of hair. All amazing. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Wow. Mmm. Alright, I'm getting a little bloated because I had a beer. This is the second ox tail drum. Haha. Mmm. I wish I had my mom's reaction to this. She really loved it. She wanted me to cut Vietnamese beef stew with this. But I think she's regretting what she said after taking a bite of this. Alright, I'll send this for tonight, guys.
