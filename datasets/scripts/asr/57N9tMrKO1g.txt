 What's up guys, we got a ton of requests, maybe just a few, to make a giant mozzarella stick. And I'm thinking, how the heck do you make a giant mozzarella stick? You need to have a giant thing of cheese, right? So step one, we make a giant polyoeous string cheese. So based on common knowledge, if you take cheese and you eat it up, it melts. So if we take a bunch of polyoeous string cheese, our theory is it's gonna melt together and we're going to pipe it into our empty bringles containers because that will give it the perfect mozzarella shape. Oh, there's the pop. Oh, there's the pop. I love pre-calls. One, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, one, six, seven, eight, nine, nine, nine, nine. This is 24 in the bag. We don't have the count. 12. I just like counting. 30. Wait, so what are you doing now? I'm just putting it into my fridge. 30 seconds, stir, 30 seconds, stir. I don't think you want to stir it because you want it to be stringy this way, right? I don't know if this is even going to work. Me either. Are you nervous? Kind of. If it doesn't work, then we're not doing it anymore and this is not going to be a YouTube video. Check us fail at making this. It's going to work. What are you eating over there? Carrots. We're about to make a month's rule, Stake. I'm worried. That was 60 seconds. Starting to melt in the bottom. That's good. It's longer. What are you doing with all the pizza pre-calls? I'm going to put them in this bowl. Okay. Oh, yes. Oh, snap. Need some more. But it's getting there. All these pieces look like hot dogs. Oh, we're there. Oh, we're there. So what we're going to do is we're going to shove it in that um, let's do it like I got to do it right away. The wall is hot. Yeah, yeah. It's got to go in. Where is it? So we're here. Over here? Right here. Okay, got it. Everyone needs to love pizza prengles. I hope this works. It has to. It has to work. Just make sure it all stays as one blob as you're putting it in. So it's not going to fill the whole thing so we're going to have a chode. Yeah, it might be a little choddy. I'm going to stick in the freezer. So first of all, everything guys. The prengles in the freezer. We're bringing back our favorite chip treat puzzle. All that. They're not chips. But they're in the chip's aisle. They don't say Cheeto Puffs. They're corn puffs. Those are puffs that chip's Julia. Ask the audience. What do you like better? Cheetos or prengles? Well, I already asked them. Well, I can't even figure this thing out. There's things to go right in. But it didn't do it. Oh no. You're spilling. Ready? Yeah. Surgery guys. Dr. Julia. She's just tearing her up. Dude, it's like a little freaking mozzarella baby. Is it? That's too thick. This is the greatest thing you've ever done. You choose the, I thought it'd be bro. Or we could have put more of this paper towel roll. The paper towel roll, guys. You want me to cut it down? That's so weird. It's 24 pieces of polio string key. Into the egg. Like egg. And I'd break this in half. Like I did that giant onion ring. It would be so sad. And it goes. Got to double coat it. Because that's right. You might want to do a triple cone. That's good. We do a triple? Uh, take what you're going. This is every child's dream. That's what this is. It's going in. Oh yeah. It's going in. Oh yeah. It's just like shaking a baby. That looks like a giant cheeto puff. Yeah it does. Can I do it? I'm really proud of this. It's going in. It's going in here now. So it can rest. All right guys. Here's our frozen giant squish. Now I grab it, it took hold of it. And now it's a little guy. Probably frozen in the outside. Okay, I can put it right in. Let's see. Ready? Yep. I'm going to cut it. Oh no. I'm going to cover it. We're going to flip it. Oh my god. This is crazy. Oh, kind of cracked here. That's a giant mozzarella. Oh my god. This is going to be crazy. Julia's actually going to try to see if she get a cheese pull on. Yes. Are we really? Yeah. Just a spoon. Sprig it. And a book. Getting it? Yeah. Oh my god. Oh, Julia, it looks like you're eating like spandex. My workout band. Oh my god, this is amazing. There it goes guys. I'm lactose intolerant. No, you're not. I think we should use a paper towel roll next time. Guys, that's what a challenge video is all about. This is definitely a food challenge video. Thank you so much for not making me do this alone while you're at work. And I almost told him that I was going to make it with him because he wanted to put it in a toilet paper roll and that's cardboard in your food. So don't eat cardboard. You can eat cardboard all the time. It's good. I can see paper growing up. I just chewed on it and then before I knew it, I could swallow it. There you go guys. Has anyone ate paper before? Comment below saying yes. Ivy and paper. I have not. So I'm part of that percent. Make sure you thumbs this video up. For liking paper. And for giant Cheeto mozzarella stick fails. Fails my baby. It actually kind of looks like Chester Cheeto's like hawk. Guys, this is not healthy. Now I really have to go to the gym. Well, you got a little pull there. What do you think? I like cheese. Right? Um, I think that this is disgusting.
