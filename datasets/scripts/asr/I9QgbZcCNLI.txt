 Hello everyone. What you see before you are four big gallon size bags of brown rice. I saw I went to what is it called sprouts and they were having a sell record to get rice for Basically 69 cents a pound so I went ahead and got 50 pounds of it. I Have a bucket that's 25 pounds and basically what I noticed is the 25 pound bag is basically four gallons of rice But what I recommend the result of doing the video so I just wanted to do something quick so that if you are If you do buy a whole bunch of rice or even if you buy a little bit of rice a good steak practice is to go ahead and put it inside of the freezer for Three to four days and any eggs or if there's any bugs in it or Anything that shouldn't be that's alive in your rice. It'll basically freeze it and kill it It sounds gross. It can sound gross But what you'll end up doing is when I make my rice I always clean my rice anyway, so if there is any bugs or anything like that when I'm washing it It floats to the top and then I just pour it off. I always wash my what my rice three times strain it, you know rinse it or whatnot and then I go ahead and Cook it so even if there's any bugs or anything like that in your rice If you see any bugs in your rice because I had opened up my 25 pound bucket and I saw some Not flies but some bugs inside of it So I scraped out the bugs and threw them away. I know I didn't get all of them They probably made eggs inside of my rice But instead of throwing it away because again, look how much rice is it's 25 pounds worth of rice So what I went ahead and did is I put them in the sip-flug bags By taking them out of the bucket and put them in the gallon sized bags And then I went ahead and I put them inside the freezer for three to four days After the three to four days, I'm gonna go ahead and I say three to four days I went ahead and just kept them in the freezer for four days What I'm gonna go ahead and do now after the four days is go ahead and let it cool down and Put it back inside of the bucket and if you have any oxygen absorbers, that'd be something good to Put to put inside the bucket When you cook rice, you're always supposed to wash it always make sure another quick tip always make sure that you wash your rice because it's Never clean even if it's say it's been washed always wash yourself the same thing like if you're making a salad But wash it off always wash my rice off three times the first time you wash it You just you know squish your hand around in the rice and basically get all the You're basically the wash you just you know massage in the rice and by the time you're done massaging it like maybe 20 seconds after like massage your hand through the rice the Stuff will float to the top you'll pour that out Push more water in it rinse it off massage the rice pour it out and do it again a third time But I just wanted to say it's strongly recommended always make sure you wash your rice But after the four days you can go ahead and take it out of the freezer and put it inside of another container Whatever you have the rice in and seal it up by that time it'll go ahead and the freezer will definitely kill the eggs And when you actually cook with it you'll go ahead and wash it and you'll pour it out So just a quick tip if it's perfectly right in the refrigerator You don't have to have a big refrigerator Or a big cooler to put it in Your refrigerator work just as fine the top part for the freezer for your rice And I have the other bag where the ice is There it is there it is Thanks for watching and on behalf of your friends loved ones and family Thank you so much on behalf of them.
