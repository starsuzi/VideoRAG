 V-breaks are found on all kinds of bikes, from hybrids to mountain bikes. They are simple, effective, and with just a little know-how, easy to use and adjust. The main parts of a V-break are the brake arms, the brake noodle, and the anchor bolt. Often, there will be a rubber boot to help keep dirt out of the system. There are also brake pads, but once these are adjusted properly, you won't have to do anything to them to get your wheel in and out. The first step is to put your wheel squarely in the drop-outs and tighten the quick release lever. Next, you can start attaching the brake. Grasp the noodle and the right brake arm and push them towards each other, supporting the hinge release. Slide the noodle into the notch, making sure it seats all the way in. Slide over the boot and test the brake. If you find one brake pad is contacting the rim before the other, you may need to center your brakes. There is a small screw on each side of the brake arms. Tighten the screw on the side that is closer to the rim. This will pull the brake pad away. Conversely, you can loosen the screw on the opposite brake arm. It will have the same result. Make small adjustments until both your brake pads contact the rim at the same time. To undo the brake, just reverse the steps. Slide the boot out of the way, grab the brake arms, and pull them towards each other. Support the hinged release and slide the noodle out of the notch.
