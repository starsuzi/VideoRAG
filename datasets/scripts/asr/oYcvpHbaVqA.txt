 Hello, I'm Jenny Jones and I'm an arts and crafts expert. I'm here to show you how to make a paper fan. You can use any paper or colour paper that you can find, but today I'm going to be using some pretty butterfly wrapping paper. Okay, so you need to take your ruler and you need to measure one inch up from the bottom of your paper. So mark it there and do the same for the other side. One inch. Okay, and you're going to join those lines up together. Place your ruler to one side and we're going to start making the folds for our fan. So you need to take the bottom of the paper and we need to fold on that line. So make a nice crease like that and then we're going to turn the paper over. And we're going to fold it back the other way, making an identical crease the other way. Like that. Now you're going to keep doing this until you get to the other side of the paper. I've just folded this up until I've got all the way to the end of the paper. Now what I want to do is make a base for my fan. So you need to turn it this way and you need to bend about three inches up from the bottom. Like this and to make it really secure you can then bend the tip this way as well. Then you need to open out all the pleats of your fan. Just like that. And that's how to make a paper fan.
