 Welcome to Cooking with Skinny and Mini. I'm Chef Dahl and I'm Chuck Love and today we're going to learn how to pour and cut tomatoes. Well that's right Chuck and the way you pour tomato they actually make a tomato quarter check it out. That's neat but how's it work? Now we already rinsed off our tomatoes so we know it's washed off. Okay what you do with the tomato quarter you pop it in give it a good twist. Oh wow there it goes. Take this quarter right out. See that? You think I can try it? I take that in there. Oh man. Wait. And there you go. It's how you pour tomato. Next we're going to learn how to cut a tomato and what most people use obviously people use tomato slices for their hamburger so what are we going to do? I always cut off the top of the tomato a very thin slice. I don't like that top part. Cut off the top real quick. There you go. And now you're ready if anyone needs a tomato slice for their chicken sandwich or a hamburger? We got slices. There we go. We're getting slices too. There you go. And the next thing I like to do with tomatoes. I like to dice them so what I'll do I'll cut that in half. Almost as I cut an onion. I've cut down a couple pieces but not all the way right? Right. Then you do what? One or two uh two across. Two across. Watch your fingers and then cut down. And you get perfect little squares every time. That's good. Yeah so I mean you have your tomato slices or you can do squares or it depends what you're using your tomatoes for. That's how you pour and cut it tomato. Yeah Chuck. I mean we actually use the tomato core and we made a couple slices and small dice tomato so the summer when you have your jersey tomatoes oh yeah they're always good excellent. We'll be able to go ahead and work with them so again this is cooking with skinny mini. I'm chef Doug and I'm Chuck Laws. We'll see you next time.
