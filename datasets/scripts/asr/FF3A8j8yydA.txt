 What the? There was trains off and I'm not hooded anymore. Okay, I've got to get out of here before I can stay in that bed. Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'll stay here. You're a regular doctor is away so he has me to take over your care. I'm Dr. Terminus. The doctor says you need a wreck to examine. Now get on and off with your butt talks in the air. I'm going to examine you myself personally. No, I am not going to do it. Alright, alright, alright, alright, I'll get into position. Okay, see me getting into position. No, hold still. This will not hurt a bit. Oh, that's so high, warrior. Yeah. No blogage, no swelling, no anything. I guess you're healthy. You should not have done it to me. I'm going to sue for my practice as soon as I get out of here. I mean it. Alright, I'm getting out, I'm getting out of here. I'm not bad. Oh, you're going to say hello to my little friend here. This is what I use to control unruly patients like you. Oh, alright, alright, alright. Just don't point that thing at me. Please, I'll stay here really. If you do step out of line, I will hunt you down.
