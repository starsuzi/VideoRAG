 This is it. Rupert Thorns Bookie joint. Good hits we leave my loan. That hits we eat them hard. Everybody down! I said down! Don't bother to adjust the picture. For the next five minutes I'm in control. Get the money! Hey look at this! Must be a couple of hundred silver dollars. Bring it. I'll take that. Jury wasn't part of the plan. He got a flip for it. What? Good side. Leave it. What? What two face? I said leave it! Before I go, I want you all to give Rupert Thorns a message for me. How much did he take me for this time? 200,000. I thought we got rid of this guy. Are you kidding? We created him. Six months of this is long enough. Spread the word. I'm putting out a contract. One million. No, make it two million. A million dollars of face to the man who brings me two face. 64, 8, 64, 9, 65,000. You don't touch anything until I tell you to poke. You always were a couple of greedy little bears. Even when I prosecuted you as DA. What are you looking at? Two face, if you miss her, why don't you go see her? Sure. We could even bring her here if you want. Forget it. We have more important things to do. I've decided it's time to finish Thorne. Once and for all. You're gonna knock him off? Let's just say I will let do it to him. Exactly what he did to me.
