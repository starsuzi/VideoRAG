 Hi everyone today I'm doing a review on the Coup Home Goods Shredded Memory Phone Pillow. I bought two of them from the website. Their own website you could also purchase it from Amazon and I believe it's the exact same price. They retail I bought the standard pillow and it retails for $49.99. I believe if you sign up with your email as a first time customer you also get a discount code. So I believe I got 10% off so I paid 89.98 I think free shipping for both pillows and I really think that that's a great deal especially because a lot of the memory phone pillows are about the same price around $50 so I believe that these pillows are the best on the market. They have amazing reviews so I decided to purchase it and now I'm gonna give you my review on it. The outside cover is bamboo and it's very very soft. I'm not a crazy fan about the pattern that's on it but that's okay because you cover it up with a pillow case anyway. So very detailed it's quilted and quilted by you know like stitching. The stitching looks like it's quilted it's not really quilted but it's very very soft and what I like about this is that it's removable so it has a zipper to remove it right here. Each one of them here is the coupe Hungguts tag and I want to explain that each pillow is different size because what I really love about these pillows is that it's adjustable so you can customize it to how fluffy or how dense or not dense that you want the pillow to be to conform to your neck your head etc. So the one on the right is actually my husband's and you can see it's more puffier. I actually call it fluffy because it's like puffy and fluffy so his more fluffy and mine is more flat and the reason is because I removed some of the filling so now I'm gonna show you how you can open up the pillow to access the inside so hold on. Okay so over here you have a zipper you just zip it over here and then this is actually a cover that is machine washable which I actually just washed and it comes out great it washes great nothing gets ruined and then the inside this is actually the pillow so I'll take off the cover so that you can see the pillow so this is what the pillow looks like without the cover on it so it has obviously two covers this is what keeps the memory foam inside what I really like about this particular brand of pillows is that the memory foam is all the same they use their own shredded memory foam they don't take pieces from you know couch cushions and like discarded furniture pieces to put inside of the pillow these are actually pieces that are made for the pillow so when you open it you have access to the shredded memory foam which is one color as you can see a lot of other brands of pillows do not have this they do not have the same color because they're literally pieces of different memory foam shreds that are put inside of a pillow so you can see that this is all uniform and very small pieces and squishy very very squishy so you can customize the pillow you can just take it out and keep adjusting it until you until you feel comfortable so I for my pillow this is how much I took out so I took out a whole one gallon Ziploc bag full now I saved it just in case it goes flat somehow in the future I can add more to it now originally it took out one gallon bag and I felt like it was still too dense for me so I took out another gallon bag of it and it was way too flat it became very like lumpy you can see through the cover you can kind of see yeah you definitely can see the memory foam pieces through it but it's very very soft it doesn't hurt you you could see the bounce back like that it's very very soft and then what I did was after I took out two gallons size bags of these I didn't like it so I added half of it back in and it still was a little bit not full enough for me so then I ended up putting it back in so for me the perfect amount was one less bag of it my husband on the other hand like I said this is what it looks like without taking any memory foam out so me I'll show you that how it looks without the cover on it okay so side by side this is on the right side the one that I didn't take any memory foam out of this is the original plushness thickness that came as is and then on the left is mine that I took the one gallon Ziploc bag full out of so you can see that it's a little less dense compared to that one let me see if I can show it to you like this it doesn't look like much of a difference but you can definitely like tell that there's more like space in here for me I'm you know I'm not as big you know as my husband and you know I like to sleep on my side he likes to sleep on his back and his side so these pillows are great for all sorts of sleeping I sleep on my back I sleep on my side mostly and then I sleep on my stomach these are really great for stomach sleepers side sleepers I love these pillows like they are my favorite pillow ever I honestly when we first got it I thought that it was a little bit like not great but then after about a week or two you get used to it because it is a little bit different but it just starts to kind of like mold you after you use it for a while so yeah I love them I wanted to I want to discuss the smell when you first get it the smell is very potent and I didn't put it in the dryer so the smell did bother me for a while but it does dissipate and it goes away you could throw it in the dryer to get rid of the smell faster so but it's not bad but yeah so that's the pillows I love them I love that you can adjust them you don't have to send it back to the manufacturer to adjust the pillow and yeah that that's it if you have any questions about it let me know in the comments down below I'm gonna put a coupon code in the in the description box as well so that you can get a discount on the purchase of a new pillow for yourself thank you so much for watching give it a thumbs up if you found this video helpful
