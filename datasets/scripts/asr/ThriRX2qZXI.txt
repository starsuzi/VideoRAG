 We're going to do a taste test on Kodiak Kakes, Metrics Pancake Mix and P28 Pancake Mix. We wanted to show you how big each serving makes this one. So each one is one serving of the mix. So I guess we could read off the macros. Chrissy. The Kodiak Kakes would be is a half a cup serving and it's too fat, 30 car 14 protein 190 calories. That's what it made for a half cup. Okay. The Metrics is two scoops as a serving, is 200 calories, it's 2.5 fat, 30 car 12 protein. That's what this made. This is true of pretty comparable in macros. And then the P28 is 170 calories, it's a 4 grams, 21 carbs, 14 protein. So it's the least amount of carbs. Yeah, less carbs a little bit. It actually made the biggest one. It kind of overflowed a little bit. So it's kind of crispy. It's crispy. Yeah. Okay. So we're going to taste test this. One, two, do you remember which one was which? No. Okay. A lot of fun with that. Oh. You can just tell me. Take to say which one I like the best. That one's metrics. This one's P28, that one's Kodiak. Okay. It's like really light, medium and dark. The metrics is the medium. Yeah. Uh oh. Right now butter. Yeah, you kind of just open up before it. No. Yeah, that's what I do. I'm just saying sugar freezer. Because I'm about that light. Do you do that every morning? Mm-hmm. Oh. Okay. Here we go. What do you do first? Kodiak. Okay. Me too. I don't think we've ever had Kodiak cakes plain. We usually put protein in them. Because that's what we make every morning. It tastes just like a regular waffle. Yeah, it's not like buttery or anything. It's just like a regular waffle. Metrics can't taste buttery. The texture's a little bit different like it's a little bit come here. Like protein gummy, you know? Yeah. It has a different, it has an aftertaste. Does that make sense? This P20 is dark, what, do you worry about it? Is dark chocolate coconut? No, it's dark chocolate coconut. Is that cookie too long? Or is it just that material? You might have cookies too long. I think I taste the coconut. Somebody is strong. I don't like it. There's a weird aftertaste. There's a really weird taste. Like I'll be honest with you. It tastes like sticky feet. No, it tastes like you like burped up in your mouth. That's what it tastes like. There's like this sour aftertaste. Yeah, I'm gonna try it again but that's bad. I don't like that. You can get one more try. We know, like it tastes like coconut. I'm gonna get that overpowered everything and it's okay. But then it's just like this. There's this weird, I remember when we did the jelly bean challenge and it tastes like sticky feet. Yeah. I'm not even gonna finish it. Then you know I like eat everything. So you need some like really flavorful protein to cover that up. Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna go back to Cody X cakes one more time and see. I'm gonna put metrics in Cody X. Is that what I'm saying again? Let me make a palette cleanser after that. Yeah. This is not good. Not good. Okay. If I had to compare textures, I like Cody X cakes better than metrics. The macros are pretty much the same. Yeah, but I like the metrics to me has a little bit more of a buttery flavor to it. It even smells like when I was mixing it, it smells more like cakey. Like buttery. But it is. It's a little gum here. It's not like bad gummy, but it's like it's got the protein gummy. Like if you've ever made like overnight oats, or you've had that, it has like that protein kind of gumminess to it. Pretty much identical macros. Yeah. So I would say based on texture, it would be Cody X cakes metrics. I mean, between eight textures isn't bad. It's just like it's taste so bad I'm not even gonna give it a good score. Based on flavor metrics, Cody X cakes. So honestly, maybe the best bet would be to do half the serving of this and half the serving of this and maybe you can get the buttery taste and get rid of the texture. But. We always add protein powder to our Cody X cakes or yeah. Making so that always helps. Yeah, so maybe we'll try that. But as of right now, I'd say this is essentially a tie. And that is just horrible. Like not even a third. It's like way down there. It's so bad. I'm sorry. Yeah. Not good. Save yourself. Don't do P28. Cody X cakes are metrics. We're now going to actually eat. But for real though, and also the Cody X cakes, it's on sale at Costco right now. Like $3.50 off. So it's only like $8 for this giant box. Oh yeah, how does it look? And this, this right here, there's 16 servings in this box. And this box has 39 servings. And I think this is $12 and this is like $8. So. So if you're looking at costs too, which I don't know, you may be like get this cheaper. I just found out an Amazon. But. You might want to go with Cody X cakes. Yeah, if you really cost. Conscious. Conscious. Conscious. You're this piece of your spiritual. It's just. It's conscious. Okay. Get it. Amy, some. No, no. Amy, uh, what do I want to be? So I can do it on my plate. Amy, another one of those. It's so bad. Yeah, no, you can go put this like over there. I wouldn't even feed it to my dog. Okay.
