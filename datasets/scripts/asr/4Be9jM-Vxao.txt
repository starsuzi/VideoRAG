 Hi my name is Samo from Cleaner London and today I'm going to show you how to clean an extractor heard with a steam cleaning machine which has many uses. The steam cleaning machine you can see here is very simple to use, you literally just plug it into the wall, you fill it up here with water and switch it on and you wait for the lights to go on and then it's ready to use. Okay so all we do is we blast the steam onto the extractor heard, like so this will loosen any grease and dirt, it's chemical free and does not harm the environment is safe to use around children. Using a microfiber cloth, we simply wipe off and all the grease and dirt stays on the cloth. This can be used for the underside as well to loosen the grease and dirt from here, it's easy to use, quit and doesn't leave any residue. And again using a cloth just wipe the underside and all the grease goes on the cloth. And that's how to steam clean an extractor heard.
