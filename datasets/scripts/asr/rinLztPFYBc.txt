 Hey everyone, my name is Lisa Tracus and I'm an instructor here at Toronto Institute of Bar Tending. Today I'm going to show you how to make Canada's number one cocktail, which is the classic Caesar. The glass we're there I'm using today is a high ball glass feel free to be very adventurous with your glassware, especially when you're entertaining different guests. And what you want to do is first build your glass with ice. Make sure you fill it right up. We're also going to be using puller ice vodka today for any great Canadian cocktail. I like to use a great Canadian vodka. We're going to add one ounce of vodka. We're also going to spice our ice. So two dashes of Frank's Red Hot Caesar Spicer. Feel free to add more spices if you want to if you like it that much spicier. And we're going to also add three dashes or four dashes of Worsh. We're going to add some fresh cracked pepper and also fresh sea salt. And three dashes. And now we're going to add my favorite ingredients, Mock Clamato, to top it off. Now what you can do, you can stir your cocktail if you'd like or what I like to do is I like to roll my cocktail for the Caesar. You only want to roll it but two or three times you don't want to water down this cocktail. And now is when we can actually rim our glassware. So you're going to rim the glass with lime and we're going to use the Clamato Rimmer. Give it a little tap to knock off any excess. And you can pour your cocktail then. Celery stick for garnish. A couple of straws. And there you have Candice No. 1 cocktail. For more information on this classic Caesar as well as many other recipes, you can visit our website at www.trondwiretending.com.
