you all have a lot of people who have already developed this This is a very good moisturizer, it's a very light moisturizer You get 100 ml of this, it has a price of 150 rupees I think it has a smaller container and a bigger container I think this is a very budget-friendly price It's easy to develop, in any medical shop, in grocery or in cosmetics shop It's a very good product This cream is a completely white color, it has a light consistency It's a very lightweight moisturizer You massage it with a good skin And it also absorbs it very quickly This moisturizer is a normal dry or combination It's suitable for all skin types So, if you want to try it, then go for it You can see, this is completely non-gracy formula There is no greasyness in the skin And there is no oily and shiny look So, it's a good thing Because many people don't like this Cold cream means a lot of moisturizers And shiny looking skin, oily looking skin, greasy skin So, I think this will be a good thing for them This moisturizer is Almond oil and Jojo Bawil Next, this is a Likurish cold cream by VLCC It comes in top packaging It has a 50 gm product, which has a price of 135 rupees So, this is a very good budget-friendly And, the key ingredients are extract of grape seed Cobra safron, rose petals, Likurish and aloe vera Oil of Jojo Bawil and Olive and Vitamin E After opening this cream, you get a piece of steel It has a top packaging, this is a cream And, the consistency of this cream is very thick So, it's very thick, so it also moisturizes And, this cream is normal for dry skin I'll apply this to you For the skin to absorb the skin, it takes some time to massage your skin After applying, when your skin gets a little warmer, it doesn't look shiny But, this is not greasy If you have dry skin, you can try this cream The fragrance of this cream is a little artificial But, it's very light I don't think there will be any problem with this cream But, I don't like the fragrance And, about this packaging, I think it has a 50 gm product It has a little bit of packaging And, after opening it, I can understand it The product is here If the product is completely empty, the packaging is not that big If it was small, it would have been more carrying So, the packaging is better Otherwise, the product is very good After this, I have the cream of Blue Color This cream is with me, I have been connected with my childhood My mother-in-law, my childhood, I used to use this cream in the winter season And, this cream is 60 ml product, and this is 85 rupees So, this is also a budget-friendly one

that you use this moisturizer to sleep And, on the sub-road, your skin is very soft and supple and radiant This is a guarantee, if you have dry skin type, try it I like this cream, it is a bit difficult to spread it Otherwise, this cream is a very good cream for winter After this, I have a Johnson's Baby Milk Cream This moisturizer, I have applied it in my entire college life In the winter season, I have 100 grams of product, which is a price of 145 rupees And, this is a good thing, that you get a cosmetics shop And, you will get a small packaging of this cream And, this one is a pink one So, both the moisturizers are very same, I don't understand any difference So, you can try them both And, this moisturizer is good for all skin types If you have this combination, dry, oily, not oily, it is not too oily It is a bit oily, so, you can try it with a milk This Johnson's Baby Cream is the consistency of this cream And, this cream is 6 to 7 hours easily moisturized If you take a
