 We are making pickled carrots. You have to peel them, cut off both ends, slice them into sticks. I cut them into 3. Now, they are like that. Some small onions. And then this way. I'm going to rinse these, let them dry in a minute. Pickled okra. Because my friend, she loves pickled okra. She's running from earlier and if she gets near it, you can't hold her back. Yeah, really miles away from my class. She brought a little can of pickled okra. And Amelia was sitting next to her. Amelia just snagged it and made it all. She's crazy. Now we're going to mix up our pickling solution to pour over the canned carrots. I'm going to double this recipe because I'd rather have too much than not enough. So we need 1 1-half cup of canning salt, pickling salt, same thing. 1 1-half cup. So there is a 1-half a cup of canning salt. One cup of 90 grain vinegar. One cup? Yeah. Wow. Okay. Yeah, it's very strong. Three cups of water. All the way to the top. One, two. Three, two, three. There you go. Good. You heat this mixture on the stove until it begins to boil. Now we're ready to put the carrots in the jar. Take the jar. Couple of cloves of garlic. Couple of things of onion. Some. I'm using three dill. I'm actually going to put them in the side there. I'm going to put a little extra dill in it. I'm going to add dill seed, not weed seed. I'm going to put about 1-half a teaspoon in the jar. I'm going to go to the next one, two. Now we're going to take the carrots. About three at a time and you just pack them in there as best you can. If I think they're too long, just take a knife, cut off what I think is too long. You can leave it in the jar or put it in another one. And still pack them. And then I just stick the little bit of ones down in there if I can fit them in there. And then I just put them in there. Little more. Anyway, these are packed pretty good. About maybe a quarter of an inch from the top. All right. And these lids being hot, help also helps it to seal. I use this recipe for pickles, okra, cucumbers. I think if you like pickled tomatoes, I suppose you could use it for green tomatoes. Okay. Now we have these jars ready. We're going to take them over to the pot. So all we're going back in for? About 10 minutes. All the way to water, right? All the way. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
