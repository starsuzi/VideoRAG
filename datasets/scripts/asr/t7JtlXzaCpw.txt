 Saved from the grubby mitts of the scrapper people was an amazing Chester refrigerator seven-up machine that we're gonna save plug it in right now. It doesn't cool But that's easily fixed this right here Seven-up machine used to bend bottles like this They would just be it's what you call slider machine and these would be lined up in there You put your coins in and you slide it over and you pull out the cold soda Whatever one you wanted I think it only vented one type seven up of course the end cola but all the guts are gone But it's still an amazing amazing Chester refrigerator and we're gonna fix it and if you're watching this because your refrigerator doesn't work The same principles here are for a stand-up refrigerator with doors just this one's just sideways I guess it's an under-fridgerator Keep watching so first thing you're gonna run into when you want to work on one of these systems is there's actually no way to Actually hook up your gauges. There's no service ports. Anyway, you can see that I do have a service port on here And I did that with what's called a line tap and these are cheap. I'll put a link to them below You can have to get them shipped to you for like five bucks or something to that effect So really low investment, but this one's on there's called a Mac adjustable line tap valve And what it does is just slides over the round line pierces a little hole and gives you a place to actually have a fitting Now what this one where you want to hook it is right off of The compressor motor there's gonna be a dead end line that just comes straight out and Just dead ends it just ends and so you can see right here that they've crimped and crimped it and then they just plugged it up with You know they brazed brazed it closed so it never leaks and it's completely sealed system So now I can test my pressures see how much pressure is in there I can pressurize the system I can add gas I can take gas out Everything else and so in this situation I actually hooked it up after I ran this for a while Actually hooked it up and found out there was zero pressure So it wasn't cooling at all when I got this. I mean this has been sitting for you know twenty thirty years Who knows and of course it didn't cool, but the motor runs you plug it in it hums away and definitely for as long as you want But I hooked up the gauges and the pressure was zero so No pressure now. We've just got to find the leak so what I'm using to pressurize the system is definitely not compressed air Because there's gonna be moisture in it. You don't want to introduce moisture Into your system. So what I'm gonna use the ideal thing to use is nitrogen I don't have nitrogen. I don't have access to nitrogen I'm not gonna spend a couple hundred dollars on a nitrogen tank for a a worthless Cooler, you know that's it's worth it. If it doesn't work it doesn't work. It's worthless But I'm not gonna spend the money on a worthless cooler more money than it's worth to work on it So what I'm gonna use is there's you can use argon as well places don't use it, you know Read online because it's more expensive than nitrogen. So you don't use argon But I do have welding gas that is argon CO2. It's only 25% CO2 and this is in a steel tank So I doubt the 25% CO2 has moisture in it You know even if it does it's extremely small, but I doubt there's any moisture in it argon doesn't have any moisture in it But I doubt there's any actual You know moisture in this steel tank So we should have a dry gas that can pressurize the system and I'm gonna use my I'm using my welding regulator because I don't want the straight pressure out. This is 1900 psi. That's about 140 bar So that's a ton of pressure So I need to use my welding regulator to really scale that down to under a hundred psi or so Pressurize a system or maybe even a hundred psi if I could but what I was able to give is about 85 psi And so I just took my welding line it would normally go to my welder and Hose clamped on a piece of heater hose to Slit inside a piece of fuel line and then crimped that to an older Manifold gauge thing didn't cut it was able to just crimp to the very end now This is a temporary temporary setup just enough to get the gas and as I was able to pressurize the system up to about 85 psi and Found the leak so now we're gonna tackle we're gonna tackle the leak Oh Oh So it actually took a couple tries to actually get that sealed up and the problem is is I didn't have anything Generally when you're sealing something you put a a union or a joint like this right here I mean insert the copper and in the copper or the solder sweats itself in and seals up So I couldn't get it to get it open it up the pinhole So what I did is I took some stranded copper wire Just like this took three or four strands about this long and I actually just wrapped them around Just wrapped them around the pipe and that just gave the the solder something to bite on to and Seal so I just wrapped that around where the hole was a couple strands of it tap solder Float all the way around it and it is sealed up good and the reason I didn't use brazing rod is because Even though it looked like it had a big flame there I was only getting this pipe up to maybe like 500 degrees or so maybe 600 Where if brazing rod is way better, but brazing I would have to get this up to a 13 1400 degrees 1500 degrees and I don't want that traveling up inside that sealed that I can't see so We're sealed up so now I got an airtight system that a whole pressure as long as I want so I'm ready to refill it with a refrigerant right first Got a vacuum it down and what we're doing is we're creating a vacuum in there to boil off any moisture and a pull out any Crapie air back in the day before they had vacuums what they would do is they've just purged it So they'd run nitrogen or argon or some other inert gas through it just to clean out the system But it left no some crannies pound out they will they discovered that vacuum it down actually left it cleaner So there's a couple other options If you're looking for vacuum pumps first one you'll run into in a very friendly price range is one of these This is an air vacuum pump and they do work What it does is you just plug your air compressor in you need a decent size air compressor because it uses a Fair amount of air and it uses a Venturi effect and just vacuums it down. They're not that efficient They work okay this one I've done on my test is 92 point 92.4 percent efficient So it's only 92 percent efficient which isn't great, but it will work in a pinch Better than that or actually electric pumps and you'll see more HVag guys or if you read for them It's a stomach that that's what they're gonna use because you don't want to carry an air compressor out to a job site along with your Pump like this big old air compressor. It's easier just to carry an electric unit and they're very efficient But you'll start looking at those and there's there in the hundreds of dollar range some of them will get up to Probably been a thousand dollar range for amazing ones And then they'll rate them down and how many microns they can pull But even better than that and even cheaper, you know if you're doing this on the cheap is one of these This is a AC compressor the same thing that's right in there that we're working on Here's one from a system that wasn't salvageable so if you're doing this and the system isn't salvageable You just take out the old wouldn't use you use the the old one for a Your own vacuum pump or you just look on Craigslist and matter of seconds you can find a million old refrigerators They have one of these units, you know this one's a little bit taller because it came out of a like an AC like window AC Type unit and this will pull an amazing vacuum it pulls I've tested it down to What is it 98.3% is what I get out of it and that's 15 microns and if you start looking at pumps the 15 micron pump is amazing And you're in the hundreds of hundreds of dollar range for free for free But all we do is and I'll put a video how to Mod one of these up how to make one but this will pull down to Whatever pressure we needed to plenty to do what we needed to the idea is we want to pull vacuum Solo that it actually boils off the water Because the lower the vacuum the The lower the pressure that the water boils this one I can pull a 98.3% efficiency Printed off a chart. I can look up. That's about 15 microns I can look right up right here real fast and fat on 15 microns is Wrong chart 15 microns my water water a boil 64 degrees So 64 degrees is pretty low for water to boil problem is this is very chilly out here It's only actually 60 degrees. So even pulling with this which is extremely efficient my water's not gonna boil So what do I do? quick and easy We cheat one of these it's hot air gun all I got to do is heat up my lines because right now they're 60 degrees All I got to do is heat them up a couple degrees. I can run this over really quick And I can get that up to 100 degrees in In a minute and so I'll just run this over everything just warm it up You put a little space heater in there. You just warm up that thing. So if you're using one of these Which is a little way less efficient Water to boil at 104 degrees or so so 104 degrees It doesn't take much you know just to warm this up and get that up to 104 degrees So even with an inadequate pump you can get it to work as long as your system is all warm because then the water vapor Reboil turned into a steam turned into a gas and get sucked right out and you'll have a dry system. So I'll put a video on how to build one of these I'll put a link at the end of this video but for now I'm gonna vacuum vacuum it out and then we're on to put an Underfrigerant So now it's time to put in the refrigerant. We got to completely vacuum down system. It's Dry and ready to accept now. What kind of refrigerant do you put in? Well this one came with R12 So that's what kind of should go back in but There's also Swap out ones you can put in one of them being R12 a Which essentially is just propane and butane you can put in just propane and butane and it works amazingly well There's R152A which is made from a settling they can be swapped in as well that's Good with the The oil that's already in there and R152A is just Airdester the same stuff you spray out and goes into those on that's airdester You can't swap in like the R134A the same stuff in your car You can't swap that into an R12 system unless you're gonna clean out all the oil and take out the whole compressor You don't do that in those things But the 12 which was in there is probably the most the best idea to put back in there I'm not gonna show you guys that but then if you're asking whoa you can't get 12 anymore No, you can't and it's super expensive. No, it's not actually the nice thing is is back when they swapped it out in 94 Everybody wanted it everybody hoarded it. It was a million bucks is way more expensive than any other refrigerant But everybody with those cars are gone. So those cars are long gone the AC systems in those are all converted They're gone so now you can buy a can of The R12 off eBay for 10 bucks 15 bucks get two cans for 25 something of that effect so about the same price you can just go down to Walmart and buy one of these You can go buy a can of R12. I'm not telling you do that. I'm not telling you Yeah, I'm not gonna show you that. Oh, we use this can for demonstration There's a couple different styles of cans and a couple different styles of fittings You got the cans have the little screw on top. You got cans that are just plain on top And you use the corresponding screw on this screws onto this one the older style This just flat on the top uses one that crimps on and then this little thing screws in and it pierces a hole Right in the top the same that this does but what you'll do is you screw this on you hook up your whole system You'll pierce your pierce it you open it up So now there's gas trying to flow but you'll come up here and you'll crack this middle line To bleed the system and that will bleed out any It'll bleed out any air that's trapped in this line moisture that's in this line It was blow it out. You'll screw it back down tight You'll just do that for a split second and the only air you're left with in in there and only contaminants is just a little teeny Teenagee little spot can be perfect But then we'll make sure that's completely open and then we'll just crack our valve and let the juice flow in Breathe your sides refrigerators all that will have a capacity this one has a seven ounce capacity I have an ounce the exact amount of ounces that this system was designed for so as long as I just put that in By taking this and you know if you're using something like this and just put it on a kitchen scale a nice digital kitchen scale Set it down so the whole way to the hose and everything is equal and Just flow it in with your knob right here to get to where you need to be Leave a little bit extra so if your seven ounces putting I don't know seven and a half ounces or so and accounting for whatever would actually Flow would be stuck in this line And when you disconnect it because it's disconnected all this stuff you'll lose just a little bit, but I'm gonna recharge it. So it's been a couple days is a cold Just barely kicked on Sin at a comfy 34 degrees Can we have our cold beverage? You know we can Thanks for watching guys Don't forget the rate, comment, subscribe and If you want to know how to make the vacuum pump, don't forget to clean the link right over here go to Facebook See you guys soon.
