 Hi, it's Alaska Granny. If you're hiking around in the spring, look for the fiddlehead ferns. You can go ahead and snip off the tips, but remember, never eat them raw. Fiddlehead ferns need to be cooked to avoid food-borne illnesses. Fiddleheads are easy to prepare. Rinse them well with cool water, get all the brown papery bits off of them, continue to rinse them and sort through them until there's no longer any brown bits. They're ready to cook once they look green and clean. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and now you're going to boil the fiddlehead ferns, cook them until they're just barely tender about 7-10 minutes. Heat up a skillet with some olive oil over a medium-high heat, add your fiddlehead ferns, some garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir them around, cook them for about 5 minutes until they're just nicely tender, barely browned and delicious. You can remove them from the heat, you can add a splash of lemon juice, add a splash of vinegar, you can eat them warm, you can chill them and add them to salads. They're great on Christina. A lot of recipes that call for asparagus fiddlehead ferns are a nice substitute. If you're out in the woods, watch for the fiddlehead ferns and try preparing them, see if you don't find them. A new taste treat. Learn more at AlaskaGranny.com, please subscribe to the AlaskaGranny channel.
