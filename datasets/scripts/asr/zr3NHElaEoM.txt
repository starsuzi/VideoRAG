 Hi, I'm Corni Reppel and this is Dorenda from Chinos and we're going to find out if you can actually bake a pizza on the dashboard of the vehicle right now or what? 31 degrees? I think we're 31 degrees right now? We've got to be close to 40 with the human exos. Absolutely and we're supposed to be getting up to about 33-34 today so we're going to leave the pizza in here for a few hours. Yes. You think it'll actually bake? I think it's going to get definitely at rise out of the dough. The yeast in the dough is definitely going to give you some rise. Okay. Whether you're going to brown the cheese or not? Well, the melted cheese for sure. We will melt the cheese out. See if we add natural browning up there. Yes. Alright, so let's do it. Okay, can I toss? Sure! Can I toss? Yeah, just cover everything. Do whatever you want to do. Do whatever you want to do. What's your hair? Oh, hey! Oh, okay. Sauce. Alright, up. Hey, take a look. What do you want to do? Never want to do it like that. Never want to do it like that. Alright. You can do this there with a little flair to chew like a simple one. Oh, that's fine. Hey. Cheese. Oh, we've got a lot of cheese up there. We've got the cheese right in the middle. Alright. And normally this goes right in your whipped part. Absolutely. Oh, then how hot is that oven? It's 690 degrees. It's 690 degrees. I don't think it's going to be able to get quite that hot. I don't, I hope not. But there will be no bad for it. Yeah. If it is warm, it's possible. Yeah, let's keep the heat in here. Come on. Come on to the deck of the oven. Check it out. Quick, we're open. Oh, it's hot. Okay. Yeah. So it's on the pan. The pan right now, the surface temperature of the pan is sitting at about 63 degrees. And it's just been in the sun just for a few minutes. So now we'll leave it in the sun on this pan, on this black dash. We'll leave it in here for a couple of hours and we'll see what happens. Yep. Alright. That's a good one. Okay. That's a good one. That's a good one. Another one that's been through a few hours. What do you think? It's driving. It's fucking. The cheese is melted. Is it? The dough is rising. Oh, there we go. Look at that smell. Hey, dashboard. Oh wow. Look at that. It's hot. Look how brown it is. It's actually hot. Look at this. Fresh. Wow. It's a pizza. Okay, this is not the one that actually baked on the day. But let's compare the two. Yeah. Okay. Just put that here and let's compare the two. See what this one looks like? You want to taste the winner? It's all cured meat. Okay. Exactly. Fresh, boss well cheese. The dough on the bottom here in the middle is still pretty doughy. But this on the side, this is actually baked bread on the side. Right? Just crust here. But here. Alright. Here's the test. Yeah. Well, the flavor is all there. It's fabulous. The dough is a little chewy in the middle. I'm going to bite from the side here. My grandmother always told me I would get worms from eating raw doughs. So. Is she right? I don't know. We'll find out. Oh, she's right. They need to cleanse the palate with a nice freshly baked one. Oh, there we go. Oh, yeah. This holds a little bit better. You know. You know what? We had one cloud. And if we had another 15, 20 minutes in here, I think we'd be on. So if the oven's full on a hot day and you pull up and the health inspector says we're good to go, we'll just use your vehicle. Just borrow the dash. Yeah. No problem with that. Yeah, it's good work. You know, we did this for fun and it's all silly and we had a good time with this and thank you so much for helping us with this. But you know, this is actually very serious. When you think of people leaving their children, people leaving their dogs inside the vehicle on a sunny day like this. It's very hot. Very quick. If you would not put your child in an oven, this is hot enough to bake a pizza. You would not put your child in an oven. You would not put your dog in an oven. This is hot enough to bake food. Yes. Yeah. You get in the vehicle and the heat coming out is just an example of what? No. Even just for a few minutes. It's just not right. Is a delicious way to prove the point. Yeah, absolutely. Cheers.
