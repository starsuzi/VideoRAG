 Hi all the viewers now how do you guys deal with such a problem? Yeah the wheel doesn't really want to spin freely and we can hear some friction down there in the caliper brakes so friend of mine who brought his cube bike to our Canada studio was wasting a lot of energy on the trails because the braking paths are rubbing against the disc rotor. Now what would you do? What I did was to ask him have you been experiencing this problem from the very beginning? He said no the brakes were okay. These are hey a stroke or right some basic but decent brakes really so I said alright we have to buy and and replace those braking paths. And so we did we did purchase braking paths we just arrived actually two pairs for front and wheel because front wheel had same problem and then when I wanted to replace those I discovered that the braking paths were okay so it was my mistake I should have checked the braking paths before. These are not worn down so what's the problem here? The problem here is that when my friend was just removing the wheels from the bike and then putting them back together something sometimes goes out of true. I know some guys who have to re-adjust those calipers after almost each time they put the bike into the car by removing the wheels and putting them back on. So that's sometimes the problem here and I'm gonna show you just some very very basic tip that most of us would use plus one that we often forget about. What we have to do tip number one is that we of course we are loosening those mounting bolts just a little bit so that the caliper is able to be moving freely and now we want to center this one against the disc rotor how we do it it's easy we simply hit the braking lever you can see that the caliper is moving now so I'm just breaking and I will keep the brake with my left hand and now I'm just fastening those bolts because while I'm breaking those braking paths are squeezing against the disc rotor and those are just like truing the caliper against the rotor and this method this tip would work for most of the models sometimes perfectly sometimes not so all right I'm not breaking anymore and let's just see what happens it's much better but it's not perfect so if you want to do it perfectly the tip number two is don't hesitate to to react just the caliper just by hand and by eye how do we do it you have to look at your disc rotor and you will see as here I'm hoping that you can see this that there is more distance on the outer side than on the inner side between the disc rotor and the braking paths so what I know is that the caliper should go a bit just to to the inside what I'm doing now I'm doing it very very gently I will hope the caliper just like this and I'm loosening those bolts once more and now we have to somehow move the caliper to the inside of the bike or to the right I'm not moving in with the finger because you will just overdo it what I do is to simply simply use my my Allen key and I'm hitting both left and right caliper because the caliper must be parallel to the to the disc rotor all right so this is how it works and now I'm looking from the back once more okay I can see maybe I even went just a bit too far once more now it seems to be just perfect so let's just fasten those bolts super gently so that nothing moves here okay it moved you can see that it moved while I was assembling it so that it will be just different from for different models but I can see that it's now almost perfect okay once more okay it's just fine one thing is of course about the disc brake you have to make sure it is true this one is just a little bit out of true I would say 90% of those disc rotors are just a bit bit out of true but it's like maybe I don't know half of millimeter millimeter and I can see that the distance from the left and the right side is just the same so it's done all right guys I'm back because I still wasn't quite happy with what I did but here now it's just perfect so no rubbing whatsoever remember to maybe just the brake for a couple of times to see whether anything changes because you know those braking pads everything can move a little bit but here I'm very happy that it works and I did it also for my front wheel my friends front wheel which is working very very nicely so remember not only use your braking lever to center this caliper but also try to re adjust it just like little by little with your hands and always look at this distance between the rotor and the caliper here to see it I would have to see from the back and to see it on the front wheel you have to see to look from the from the front for different calipers it will be different stuff but this problem is solved so let me know guys what tips do you have for the models of the brakes that you are using and I'd like to thank you for supporting my channel and watching this video see you soon bye bye
