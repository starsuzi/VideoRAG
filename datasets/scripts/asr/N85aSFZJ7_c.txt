 Okay, so this is for a Steinway studio and this wounded soldier had an ivory key that had a crack in the front. Which one is it? This one here? How do I have to crack? Yeah, look at that. So we needed to find another one. And which one did we find, Angie? Oh, look at that. That's a perfect ivory. Alright, so are we about ready to go on? Yeah. Yeah. What is that liquid? It's a lacquer thinner, okay. Just clean it up. Alright, oh yeah, I can see the shine. That's perfect. No more crack. And take it into the machine over there. Yeah. And both of them. Oh, let's go. Oh, yeah. Beautiful. Oh, I just got like a nice shiny reflection there. Yeah, from the light behind me. Perfect. And then we'll come back over. Uh-huh. Let's say here's our Steinway upright with all new action parts and tuning pins and strings. And there's our missing key. Perfect. Look at that. Oh, and it's glowing. Beautiful, Angie. Thank you. Yeah. Perfect. Thanks.
