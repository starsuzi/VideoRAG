 Pull out enough parchment paper to cover your pan. Now I know some people put their parchment paper under their pan, mark it with a pan, and then cut it. But one, I never know where a pan is. And two, I find that sometimes you still end up with a circle that's a little bit too big. So, little noisy. But I'm just going to press this into my pan, and then I'm going to use my fingernails. And I'm going to mark that outer edge. And once I've gone all the way around, you can pull it out, and you can see we have a nice edge that we can work on. And you can see it fits right inside really easily. So to make it sticks that it doesn't slide around and a bunch of the chocolate doesn't get underneath, I'm actually going to use some spray. The only spray I ever use is Baker's Joy. It's amazing. It works so well. Find the way the parchment paper curves. Mine's curving this way. Clearly that's the way it was in the roll. So put the curves side down. It will help hold it. All right. And then when I sprayed the sides and it over sprayed under the bottom, that helps hold the parchment paper in place. I do this for all of my cakes.
