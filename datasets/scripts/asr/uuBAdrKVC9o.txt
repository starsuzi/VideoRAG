 Hello and welcome to Soul Food Cooking. Today I'll be making glazed carrots. You will need 2 pounds of baby carrots, 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 and 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. Place the carrots in a pot of water. Bring the water to a boil and allow the carrots to cook for 12 minutes or until they have reached your desired texture. In a saucepan melt your butter. Now add the brown sugar, salt, pepper, and honey, and cook until the sugar has dissolved. Now add the carrots and cover with the glaze. Allow it to cook for another 5 minutes, then it is ready to serve. Glazed carrots are an easy and quick side dish and I hope you give this recipe a try.
