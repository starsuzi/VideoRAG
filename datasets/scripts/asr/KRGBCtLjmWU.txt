 Obviously just a huge go-for problem Presenting itself here and we've tried flooding these gophers out. We've tried the giant destroyer spoke gas treatment When we sound a found a fresh mount a dirt But I think the problem is is as we walk it along out back here we just see so many mounds of dirt So there's obviously just a huge tunnel system underneath all this ground by now and I mean there's just mounds of dirt everywhere Oh, you know pretty much realize that even as a tenant here. I need to take care of this of this uh go-for-problem What we're gonna try today is Is we're gonna actually try system I found on Amazon And it got really good reviews on Amazon. It was $30 on Amazon the yard butler um go for a mull bait applicator That applies bait into the subsoil or into the tunneling system. It has directions right on it Now I didn't actually buy this on Amazon like I say it was $29.95 on Amazon at this time But I actually found this at home depot for $10 less only 1995 Um, so it seemed like a pretty fair price to try it uh I wanted to get some some poison that I saw on Amazon But I didn't want to wait like because it wasn't prime. I didn't want to wait, you know 10 or 15 days for the poison to get here Uh, that was fairly reviewed. I think it was called goforgetter or something like that um But I just tried my local Feed store here and I came up with Omega I couldn't find any reviews for this stuff online. I live here in Idaho The Pacific Northwest But this is Omega go for grain bait poison um and it tells you to put the poison down inside the tunnels as well uh And it's kind of a granular grain type of a poison which is I guess what you want for this uh yard butler system So I guess the way this works is you You take this wing nut off and you load the uh poison inside Inside the top here And then what you do is you replace the cap And then this nozzle here. I'm going to have to break that that tie Uh, but you take that out and you you turn it twice and that dispenses the granular poison down inside the pole And it comes out Right there when you turn it and so it dispenses the poison right into the You'll put this down right into the the tunnel So we've got to find a tunnel first and we're going to go out here and look towards one of the fresher piles of dirt And see if we can find uh A tunnel and see if we can start applying some of this poison and uh I have a feeling it's going to be kind of a slow process We're going to have to apply probably a lot of poison to get rid of the gofor problem here out here But we're definitely going to try this now and see how well this works So we'll be back All right guys what you're looking for here is uh fairly new Uh pilot loose dirt here and we're just going to go ahead and take a really skinny long screwdriver And we're going to take it around the Edge and if it's hard to push in You know you're probably not getting a You know a tunnel But there's got to be tunnels coming up from the side here and right here I think I just felt some loose dirt Right Right there feels like one And we could dig down here, but we're pretty sure that That's a loose tunnel And we can come further out Right there Right there. So easy that goes in Same thing right there So Yeah definitely so we definitely got a tunnel coming out this way Yep, so it looks like it's Not too deep So what we're going to do is we're definitely going to go ahead and try this Right here We'll just go ahead and put our screwdriver there to go ahead and mark that All right, we'll go ahead and cut our Trap here Open this thing up And we'll go ahead and loosen the wing nut On the top here The other poison so we'll go ahead and put some of this in there Uh enough for a couple of doses and Go ahead and try to plan it in that tunnel we found You All right guys once you got it uh a little bit in here you're going to want to go ahead and replace your black cover here And then put your wing nut back on Put it on tight enough to where it won't come off And then what you're going to want to do is just take this and you're supposed to turn it twice To Open this whole up down here and then that dispenses the poison into the tunnel So we're going to go ahead and do that right now. This uh this gadget is pretty nice. I mean it has the How to load the directions and how to use it um directions right here on the handle We'll actually bring it over twice Just like that and it'll spit Double the poison out into a pile down into the tunnel So that's how that works So pretty cool little nifty tool Okay, we've put our Our uh applicator into the soil here where we marked it and we pushed down It's a little bit firmer at the start there But that's why I like these two big handles on this uh applicator here You just push down and tell you actually feel it hit the bottom So I mean it's real loose right there. So once we hit You feel it hit the bottom of the tunnel there That's what we're going to want to go ahead and apply the The poison So we're going to go ahead and turn this around it says to turn it twice Right here. It says turn handle twice To get the right amount of uh poison Okay Okay, and then we do it again Bring it all the way over And then shut it And I would assume that would be dumping the right amount of poison into the tunnel down there so We can see that It left a hole in the ground Um, we can cover that up to make sure there's no light coming in to the tunnel So hopefully it'll bait properly Let's go ahead and look for another hole Or another tunnel by another one of our Uh, mounts a dirt here Again, we're going to do the same thing here We're going to take our screwdriver Way too firm Not finding any tunnels yet Maybe right there Oh I think that's a tunnel right there right about the top We're going to go ahead and try that Yep same thing. I mean, it's really loose right here so you know that's a tunnel going in there um You can see I mean We know that there's a tunnel got to be right there because that's loose and then I'm hitting bottom right there So we're going to go ahead and dump Some of this poison right here as well We're going to turn this all the way around It says turn it twice Okay So hopefully that's what it means by turn it twice to dump the poison in if any of you guys just have one of these Yard butlers Uh, and you've used this. I feel free to leave a comment Let me know how it's worked out for you or if I'm doing this right or wrong um But hopefully if we do this Over the next week or two. I'm hoping I get rid of these gopheres and start seeing less and less of these new Mounds of dirt all the time All right guys just to let you know I'm getting pretty quick at this going around to these different piles because there's quite a few They're pretty new and I mean, it's really getting pretty easy Uh, I kind of like this tool. I just hope that the poison works. I mean here's a new pile and I'm kind of seeing that The pile where a lot of times right in the middle of the pile There's like a V almost like a V this one's a little bit smaller than usual But you can do around the side and there's usually nothing around the side But usually right up where the V is At least with my go first here in my backyard. I mean, it's usually right there in the middle as a top So that makes it pretty easy and then you just stick your Your poison applicator right down there right where you found the hole and it's as easy as slinging this thing to Over there and then back Now I don't know if I'm like I say if I'm putting too much poison in by going two rounds here That's what it says two turns So I assume that's what it means But I'd rather be safe than sorry I'd rather put too much poison down in there than not enough And only half kill them to go first and have them to survive. So I'd rather double kill them than Then not kill them So I'm just going around to all these holes. I've already done about eight or ten of these holes and Applied poison to a tunnel that I find around of them around the Edge of it a couple of them I found a couple of different tunnels on different sides of it and pretty easy I mean an application is like once you get this thing loaded with your poison Application takes you know a minute or two at each hole So if this works, this is going to be a great product So with that with a yard butler and the go for poison We'll sign off right now and we'll definitely come back and give you an update on you know How this is working? If it seems to be killing any any gopher's The bad thing is we're not really going to have any proof of any dead gopher's with this poison so You know, we'll just have to hope that we start seeing Less than less mounds all over the back of our yard And that'll be the proof we have So it may take a while before we actually start knowing If this yard butler and more importantly if the poison that we were using is actually working To kill these gopher's So And again that poison that I've been using is omega Gofer grain so there's poison right on it. It's made by our CO So we'll let you know Thanks for watching be sure you leave any comments questions thumbs up thumbs down Um and again Subscribe if you want to More importantly give me a thumbs up for thumbs down and input on You know any questions advice anything you might have for me.
