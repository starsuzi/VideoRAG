 5 hack. Here you go. You'll see my puppy. I just installed a... ...one of the eventually spent things to keep them inside without having a fence. You know where you got to run the wire underneath the ground and all that. Well, I don't know if you ever had to run 600 feet of wire under the ground with a shovel. They don't work out very well. So, life hack right here. Got my weed eater. And I got my edge trimmer on it. I'm going to go ahead and run about 4 or 5 foot section for y'all real quick. And y'all tell me what y'all think. I'm going to run about 5 feet. There you go. Now, you can easily not even go very deep right now. But to show y'all what you got to do is now push it in. That simple. That's a good life hack right there. If you have some dogs, you got dogs and you got a fence with fence. And you got a lot of wire to run. That's a lot of place to put on the run around. So, basically, get your freaking edge trimmer if you're going to run a bunch of wire under the ground.
