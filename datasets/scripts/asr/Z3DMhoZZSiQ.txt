 Hi, this is Random as possible and you're watching Eric's Servix 6. Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the long awaited How-To, Flip-A-Coin and call it right every time. How-Do-You Flip-A-Coin and call it right every time? It's amazing, isn't it? Well, let me break it down for you. Step number one, flip the coin. Step number two, catch the coin. Step number three, rub your thumb over the surface of the coin. So the surface of the coin, step number four, flip it onto the opposite hand. Step number five, call it. Heads. Step number three, what? Rub your thumb over the surface of the coin. What's that going to do? It's going to tell you what the coin is. The head is very smooth. The tail is very bumpy. It's as simple as that. So when you're going from here to here, that's when you do it. That's the timing. You got the coin in this hand, rub your thumb over it as you're flipping over onto the back of your hand. It's undetectable. People won't be able to see it. In that amount of time, it's enough to detect what it is. I know that that's the head. So when you flip it over, it's going to be a tail. Now, you don't have to use a half dollar for this. You can use any kind of coin. In fact, it doesn't even have to have a head on it. If it's say a Japanese 500 yen coin, this also has a different kind of texture. The flower on the back is very bumpy. The 500 on the front, it's very smooth. It's got a line and texture to it. You can feel the difference. It's very easy. So with whatever coin you have in your currency, use a coin that's preferably large and easy to feel the difference between the texture of the front and the back of the coin. Okay, now once again, all the steps together, flip the coin and catch it. Run your thumb over the surface of the coin and detect what it is. Flip it onto the opposite hand. Tell everybody that it's heads. And I'm out of here.
