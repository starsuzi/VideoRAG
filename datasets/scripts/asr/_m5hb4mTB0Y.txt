 Hi y'all this is fancy from cactus creek and it's almost Christmas so marrying almost Christmas and I'm doing this little video today because you've had something happen in our house the dog peeked on the guy in my bedroom and so I always tell everyone when I see him everyone was the guy come out and see what my dog and this happens in our house too unfortunately and it really does and it didn't and it happened a long time ago like six hours ago maybe even longer so anyway we're just now getting to it so we're gonna see if we can maybe get it done and fixed and it'll just be more proof that cats are really the best rough and more like well okay so this is where the incident occurred right here and unfortunately it happened long and up ago that it seeped through to the other side so what we're gonna do is put a towel down underneath here and then put another one on top like that and then so try to pull it out of there see I thought when first I showed you this video a little while ago they had not soaked through and normally it doesn't and it's super easy to just stop like you just put a towel on it and literally like it's gone so this whole soaking through thing does make it a little bit more okay so it's obviously still there so I think the next thing we're gonna do is use a little oxyclaim put that on there and then wipe it out and then I guess we'll just have to stay tuned and see what happens tomorrow see you all then bye
