 This one is called the Sparigus Fern and some people also call it Spring Arri Fern. In South Florida, especially South of Tampa, go all the way down to the Miami area along the coast. It is hugging the shore of the ground covers and just disturbing it greatly by keeping itself replicated and it won't let other things live. Now I know that people who have had it and they try to pull it out, they get very upset because it has little bitty thorns on it and if you start to pull it out, so it will really dig in and make you bleed. It's little flowers that are right here produce after this little red balls, little red fruits and those you don't want. Remember the moral of the story if it's a bad plant, don't let it fruit, don't let it make babies. This is a good time to get rid of it.
