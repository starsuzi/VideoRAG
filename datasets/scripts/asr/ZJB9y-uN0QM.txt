 I'm so excited to be here. 15 years old, how long have you been yo-yoing? I've been yo-yoing for four years now. It's only four. Four years. And your champ. Yeah, thank you. No, we've got a preventive job. We've got a good job. We've got a good job. We've got a good job. We've got a good job. We've got a good job. We've got a good job. We've got a good job. Thank you. Now, we've got a provincial competition coming up this weekend. But we want to talk about what you're working on. You've been on the show before. This is the bag of trade. This is this briefcase. This is how Harrison goes to work here. And you've been working on a new yo-yo. Yeah, I've been actually designed a yo-yo myself. And this yo-yo here that I'm yo-yoing with right now is the yo-yo that I designed. And it's going to be called the Orga. And I designed it in conjunction with my sponsor company, Care Blue Law, Joe-yo works in Edmonton. And so this yo-yo is going to be- It's going to be a better sponsor. Whatever. This yo-yo is going to be releasing tomorrow at the BC Provincial Yo-yo Championship. Yeah. And what's also even cooler is that I've also been able to incorporate it into a school project from like conceptualization to design, to marketing, and finally tomorrow is going to be sales. So I'm really excited for it. Are you seeing what he's doing here? You're like, I can't even keep up. Oh, man, Harrison. Okay, so what goes into the creation and the designing of a special yo-yo, like the one that is the Orga you said. The Orga. So this yo-yo was designed over a program called SolidWorks. So there's lots of fine-tuning in yo-yo design. And it's very precise. And you have to change everything really smallly in my newt. And so what makes this yo-yo different from other yo-yos is how it incorporates a whole bunch of different features of other yo-yos that I've liked in the past. Into one single yo-yo. So it's kind of like the supreme yo-yo. And what's the competition like this weekend? There's a provincial competition. You're doing this with ease. How is the yo-yo, the gauntlet come out here in BC? Are a lot of people doing this? Yeah, lots of people are starting to get into the yo-yo community in BC. So it's going to be pretty awesome tomorrow. Okay, when last we were on together, I got to do a little yo-yo with the old school one. You're going to teach, we have nice and tricks here. Yes. We're going to bring in a couple of friends who are just going to all of you. We're just going to give you an overview of God. Ed from our newsroom, and KJ, one of our editors, our crack team behind the scenes. They're going to come out here too. I know, come on, come on. They're not mic'd up, so you're just going to get a yo-yo and go. These ones are slightly different because I know we've tried the traditional yo-yos before. So those ones are the unresponsive yo-yo. These ones that slipped after really. You got to throw them back. Okay, we're going to give it a shot. So around the finger. So you're rating hand. Rating hand. Which finger? Does it matter? I don't know. Ready guys? Yeah, all the guys stepped back from this. So these yo-yos actually don't come back up, so you have to do a special trick called the bind to bring them back. Yeah, oh! It's all over your body last time I was listening. We dropped the ball here. We dropped the yo-yo. Mind about that. Oh, the way that you get it back up is put your finger out in front of the yo-yo. Yeah. Go around the yo-yo. Okay. Go around the yo-yo scene. That's what's happening here. You see it? Go around the yo-yo and... Catch it on the string, like that. Cross the strings. Oh, okay. See, you make it look so easy. You can take five, okay? Thanks for participating in it. I'm going to take the... Oh, hey, it's rocking it. This is how difficult it is. How long did it take for you to master all these tricks? I want to get this. I've been building up tricks for four years now, so every trick builds up onto the next one. So this is just a collection of tricks from four years now. Okay, so tomorrow your competition, your yo-yo is going to be available for sale. You've got sponsor, your 15, you are amazing. You want to show us your favorite trick as we go to breakfast? For sure, for sure. Okay. This trick is called the Harrison Hurricane. Okay, we'll step back for that. You can hear the velocity of the strings, the wing factor. Obsessed. And the catch. Very nice. Very nice. Wow. Well played. All right, so don't forget the event. If you want to go, oh my gosh, this is so cool. For the kids, provincial yo-yo competition, Taylor Park Elementary School in Burnaby. It is happening tomorrow. Wow, talk about talent, 15 years old, yo-yoing for four years and making it look so easy, Harrison. Can you do it? Very cool. Listen, back up, I'm going to work on this. We'll leave that with you now. Yeah. We're really bad, Rias. No. News is next. We're back in a moment here at breakfast television. If we're high, you know what? Never give up. Keep going.
