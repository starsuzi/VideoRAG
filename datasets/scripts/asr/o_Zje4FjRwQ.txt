 Repair clinic makes fixing things easy, with millions of replacement parts available on our website, and the help you need to do the repair yourself. If your front load washer won't drain, here are the top three most probable causes. The drain cycle begins when the control sends voltage to the drain pump, which pumps the water out the drain hose to a wash tub or drain pipe. A small object or article of clothing can sometimes create an obstruction in the pump, or a damaged impeller could cause the pump to fail mechanically. If the pump does not appear to have any damaged components and is free of obstructions, it's possible that the pump has failed electrically. You can use a multimeter to determine if the drain pump motor has continuity, a continuous electrical path present in the motor. If the motor tests negative for continuity, then the pump will need to be replaced. The drain hose may be twisted, pinched, or obstructed by a small object. If you are unable to straighten the hose or clear an obstruction, you will need to replace the hose. The control or timer locks the washer door during operation. If the door locks switch is malfunctioning, the washer may not drain even with the door closed.
