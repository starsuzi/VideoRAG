 So this is a grilled chicken on the grill. Easy what I call dry rub recipe. Got a thought out skinless, boneless chicken. We've got grilled nice and hot burners on high. We've already brushed the grill off with the brush. Everything's clean, good to go. This is a really easy recipe. It's easy to mess up though. You don't want to cook these things really fast or hot. You want to make sure they're definitely thought out. The way we do this is we take... so this is what it's called skin side up, skin side down. It takes skin side up. Stick it on the grill like that. And got three breaths tonight. Kind of open them up a little bit. Make sure they're all way up. Open. We're going to take our burns and put on low. Everything is on low. You don't want to burn anything. You don't want to flame. We use butt rub. Butt rub is something we use a lot. It's garlic and paprika and jalapenos. It's a little bit spicy. But you can kind of do like this here. Sprinkle that on on that backside. Alright. And we're going to close it down and shut it down for about 20 to 25 minutes on low. Then we'll come back to it. Alright, it's been good for about 20 minutes. We're going to take our chicken and flip them over. And we're going to add some more of our dry rub. Shut our grill down. We're going to cook about another 20 more minutes. Alright, so we are about 40 minutes into it. We put the dry rub on there. They look good. Alright, we're about 45 minutes into it. The dry rub looks good. We're nice and cooked. What I mean by that is there's no burnt marks. Everything looks nice and even. You have this nice kind of reddish look to it. The dry rub is notorious for doing that. Everything is on low heat. So we'll take our dry rub. We're going to coat it one more time. Shut it down for about 10 more minutes and you're all done. It's not easy.
