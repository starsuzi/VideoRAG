Accessories you will need for this project include. You may also need one of these accessories, depending on the kind of roofing you are installing. Before you start installation, you have to know your roof slope. Recommended slope is 1.5 inches rise by 12 inches run. Now let's start. Install the perilins and space them according to recommended instructions in our install guide. Now fix the closure strips with flat head screws. Make sure length of vertical closures are same size with spaces in between horizontal closures. Now fix the roofing sheets. Time to fix the roofing sheets. Remember every corrugated roof has slim lap and fat lap. Always overlap slim lap over the fat lap. Overlapping must be done according to the wind direction. Align sheets facing the drip edge of the roof. You can use strips to guide you. Please take your time in doing this. Now screw the sheets to the perilins with wood tights fasteners. Don't over tighten the fasteners to the sheets. Run screws vertically. Doing it horizontally will create errors you don't want. After that, repeat action till you finish. Fix other sheets like you did in step 3. Slame lap always overlap fat lap in the wind direction. Finalize installation by adding the flashes. Headwall flashing, install wall connector flashing and counter flashing. Sidewall structures, install side rich flashing to side panels, A frame structures, install rich cup to top panels or sheets at roof peak. For more information visit our website. Thank you.
