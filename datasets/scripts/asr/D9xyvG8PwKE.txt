 Hey guys, so welcome to another video. So today we're going to be doing this air freshener DIY. So yeah, if you guys were interested in learning how to redo your air freshener without having to spend so much money on replacements, just keep on watching. So with the first thing you're going to need for this is going to be an empty air freshener. We're going to be adding some lavender oil and you're going to be adding half of lavender oil into your little jar. Okay, so next step is going to be adding the rest, fill up the rest of the little container with your regular top water. Just going to be adding that water into your refillable little container. For that you guys just replace it, you guys put it back into your little cute little air freshener plugin thingy. Mine's this little pink, amazing jar. It's super cute. I got that bath and body works and it's super cute, but just you know those little refellables can be kind of pricey. So it's like an easier way if you guys are interested, you guys can use any type of essential oil you guys like. Any scent, you guys can even mix sense, you can put half of one and half of the other. And like I said just fill up half and then just fill the rest with water. I do suggest that every once in a while you guys should go and shake it up just so the oil doesn't stay on the top. Yeah, you guys here I'm going to show you how it looks. I'd like to end. I thank you guys so much for watching this video.
