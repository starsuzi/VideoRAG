 Hi, I'm Debbie Pinkerton with Gil Nursery and today I'd like to talk to you about curing for one of our favorite holiday flowers, Poinsettus. So Poinsettus come in lots of colors and shapes and sizes, but they all require the same type of care. They love to be an indirect light and to be kept evenly moist. The best place for that would be to keep them indoors in an indirect light spot with away from the heat and the AC vents. They are fine to put on a patio. Just be sure you protect them from direct sun and wind. If the temperatures get cool below 50 degrees, it'd be sure you bring them indoors and the stems are kind of fragile, so you want to be sure you're careful when you move them. When watering Poinsettus, be sure you keep the soil evenly moist and only water the soil, not the foliage. A great way to do this is to use a few ice cubes in the soil every day. If they are wrapped in foil, be sure you poke a few holes in the bottom of the foil so that they can drain and put a nice saucer underneath. It's natural for Poinsettus to have a few leaves that turn kind of old and ugly. And so you just remove those as you water your Poinsettus to keep it looking nice and fresh. And if you want to plant your Poinsettus after the holiday season, you can go to our website and find a great handout that says care for your Poinsettus after the holidays. Following these few steps will be a great way to keep your plant beautiful and we hope you come and see us soon. Thank you so much.
