 The Perler bead Tweezer Plus is a fabulous tool in making your designs. It really makes it easy to pick up the beads and place them exactly where you want them. It has two functions on the end here. There's one function that goes right into the bead so I can pick up a bead just by using the hole or I can turn the tools that I can hug the bead. If I just change it I can pick up the bead this way. So there are two ways to use that end to put the beads right into your design. It is fabulous. And then for cleanup time there's a wonderful scoop down here so all I have to do is scoop my beads right up and put them away at the end of the day.
