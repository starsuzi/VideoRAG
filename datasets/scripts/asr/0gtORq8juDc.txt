 Hey guys, welcome to my channel. Today's video is how I clean my baby's toys with my DIY cleaner I hope you enjoyed this video. We are jumping right into it First thing I like to do is gather all her toys I'm taking away whatever fabric material any of her toys or chairs have Then I also gather all her stuff animal rattles or stuff animals that I know are safe to go in the washer But you always want to make sure and read that they are okay to go in the washer I've just washed them before so I know they're fine Once everything is gathered I just go and throw it in the washer I'm already doing some wash for her so I'm just gonna throw all of this in there I do wash everything in a delicate cycle with cold water You don't want to use how water because in my shrink stuff or mess up your baby's toys So make sure you don't do that and I also put some draft feed so everything smells nice and delicious I use this in her wash all the time. So once I'm done there I move on to the rest of my toys Now for the rest of the toys I'm gonna show you how I make my own DIY cleaner I am using a spray bottle that I purchased at the dollar store I'm sure you could get them anywhere. They're super inexpensive and I am going to be using some water some distilled white vinegar and some essential oil I am using three-fourths of a cup of water and half a cup of distilled vinegar Most of the recipes I found said and equal parts water and vinegar But I did change it because I thought it was too much vinegar So you could also do that and then I'm adding about ten drops of essential oil I did boil the water that I'm using just because I didn't have any bottle water And I just didn't want to use it straight from the faucet I don't know if this is something you have to do probably not but that's just the way I do it I am using lavender oil I purchased this from a farmer's market by my house. It's all natural Now you don't need to use an oil for this the oil is just to mask this mouth of the vinegar But if you do choose to use an oil you want to make sure that is natural and it's safe because you will be put in this in your Baby's toys they will put the toys in their mouth So you just want to make sure that whatever you use is safe for the baby That said you're done just give it a little swirl and then you're ready to go Okay now to clean the toys I lay a towel on my counter just so I don't get it all over it as I'm spraying them I am using a Clean rag I just stamped it with the rest of the water that I had boiled earlier and now I'm just gonna spray the toys and wipe them down So I'm gonna speed this up because you guys are not gonna want to just watch that the whole time This is not something I do every day, but I do try to do it at least once a week or so Because if you think about it, there's labyrinth all over them and we are taking them out and touching them with our dirty hands after we touch our phone So I mean we sterilize their bottles so why not sterilize their toys a little bit So So that's about it that's how I clean her toys bad now I am just gonna wipe down her big toys because I figure I was already here and I already had the cleaner Also, I'm just gonna wipe them down whatever plastic material there is on them I didn't take the sit cover out of this one just because she doesn't use this to a much because she can't reach a floor So I don't think I need to clean it yet. I'll get it next time and now I'm just gonna wipe this down and then we'll be all done Last thing I'm doing here is labeling this bottle with a Sharpie. I'm just putting toy cleaner I don't know why I put a 17 I think I was just thinking of the year Anyways, that is all for today. I hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope you subscribe and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching
