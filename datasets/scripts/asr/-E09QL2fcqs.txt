 Hi, I'm Marty and I'm here on behalf of expert village.com and we're going to talk about how to clean your iron. Again, not for children, make sure you don't burn yourself. Well apparently it's been a while since I've cleaned my iron, so I might want to try step two. A great alternative is baking soda. Most everybody has this in the house. I use it for lots of different things. I even clean my sterling silver jewelry with this. What you want to do is you want to take two tablespoons of baking soda. You want to add just enough water to make a paste, kind of like a toothpaste. Kind of mix it up and you can see it's getting kind of pasty there. If by chance it ends up too watery, add a little bit more water.
