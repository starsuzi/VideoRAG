 Hi everybody this is Diana from Sweet Isolado and today we're going to make glazed carrots. This is a very simple but delicious side dish that you can make for all your meals, especially now during the holidays. As always, link for this recipe can be found at the end of the video and you can also find it in the info box below. So we're going to bring some salted water to a boil on high heat. Then we're going to add our rinsed and peeled carrots, reduce the heat to low and we're going to cook them for about 5 to 8 minutes or until they're tender. And this is the way you can check to see if they're ready. Then we're going to drain them and set them aside. Then in a large pan we're going to melt some butter. Then we're going to add some honey. You can also use brown sugar if you want. Now we're going to add some orange zest. This is completely optional but highly recommended. We're going to give it a stir and cook for a few minutes or until it thickens. Then the last thing we're going to do is we're going to add our cooked carrots. We're going to toss them in the glaze to make sure they're nicely coated. We're going to do this for about 3 to 5 minutes and that's pretty much it.
