 Alright so today it's not really a baking video like my normal ones are but we're doing a little bit of celebrating here in our house so we got two live lobsters figured we'd make a video to show how to prepare and cook live lobsters seems to be a question that a lot of people have. Each of these are just over a pound so they're gonna be cooking for between five and a half to six minutes. I'll put up other times based off of weight in the description below. You don't double cooking time though I'm gonna be cooking two at a time so what you don't need a double cooking time or anything like that like even the two they will still cook for five and a half to six minutes just as if you're cooking one. They've been in the refrigerator for a little while that'll help kind of slow their metabolism down some. That way their nerves aren't quite as ready I guess to receive signals when they go into the pot. It's the most humane way that I've found to do it. If you are kind of squeamish about this just keep in mind the closest relative to this is a cockroach so if you don't feel bad stepping on a cockroach you shouldn't feel bad doing this. They'll be gone in a matter of seconds when they go into the water and there's really you know there's no worries about them feeling any pain or anything like that but I have put them the refrigerator just to slow their metabolism down. One it makes them a little bit less active which makes them easier to handle. You know and two like I said it slows their metabolism and their nerves down a little bit so any pain for just a split second that they would feel they don't really feel anymore at all. As you can tell I've taken the bands off of the claws you can leave them out if they want if you want to they're made to go through the cooking cycle. I just I'm a little bit nervous that there might be a little bit of chemical leak out into the water from the from the rubber the rubber bands so I go ahead and take them off if you want to leave them off for safety sake if you don't feel quite comfortable taking them off that's perfectly fine it is 100% up to you. You can either steam or boil your your lobsters I'm going to be boiling mine today so I've got the biggest pot that I've gotten my kitchen it's pre-solucted water I salt my lobster water pretty heavily I make it taste like ocean water because this is basically the only way you're going to get any kind of flavoring into your lobsters it's kind of like pasta water if you'd like to put a little old-base seasoning or something like that in there that's perfectly okay I prefer the salt water and you know and that's that as you can tell it's it's at a boil and so what what we're gonna do is grab the lobster right by the tail actually this one's a little bit heavier so I'll put him in first the way he's in for a little bit longer grabbing by the tail and what you can do is you're gonna place him in head first and then I'm gonna clamp the lid on for about 10 seconds and after you count to 10 he's done so don't feel bad at all you do want to place him in like I said head first like this one his head goes in first which means the tiny little bit of nerve cells that they have that is considered a brain goes in first and it's done secondly in case he decides to flip his tail which is a muscular response he's splashing water away from you and not towards you also hence the lid going on as soon as we put him in so put on our first one like I said he's a little bit bigger so he needs a little bit more cooking time one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and he's gone like I said they have very little primitive brains did not feel anything and even if there was a potential for him to feel something within 10 seconds he's no more so don't feel bad about doing this at all but now that he's in there I'm gonna go ahead and put my second one in he's a little bit smaller needs a little bit less cooking time exact same thing with him and and one two three four five six seven eight nine ten all right now me to get my tongs and just push him down make sure that they're both completely in the water all right and then put on my lid let him cook for about five and a half to six minutes and then we'll come back and show you what they should look like once they come out of the water all right it's been right at six minutes our wopsters are done the way to test that is if you pull on the antenna here and it comes out fairly easily like that it's a good way to know test the other one too yeah all right so just kind of grab him out of the body there saying I just stick mine in the strainer over a bacon dish just to let some of that excess hot water drain off before we put him on a plate or anything like that because there will be hot water stuck in the you know in the shell at the different cracks and crevices of that shell it will hold on to hot water so I don't have a drain for about three to four minutes make sure that all hot water's off or at least it's cooled down enough that when you go to crack them open if it's praising your face you know you're not burning yourself so yeah let him cool down serve him with a nice you know thing of melted butter we put a little bit of old base seasoning in our butter just kind of kick up the spices a little bit really delicious really easy to make it home nothing to be afraid of so hope that you make some and enjoy these yourself and thank you very much for watching
