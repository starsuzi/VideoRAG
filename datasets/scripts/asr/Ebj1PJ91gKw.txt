 So to start off my winter unicorn bark, I have some almond bark. It is vanilla flavor and I melted it in a microwaveable bowl. There is a help to video on that. On my channel, link is above. I avoid to split the almond bark into three separate colors so that we can create the three colors. One of the colors will be white, one will be blue and one will be pink. You can choose whatever color you'd like to depending on the holiday or the occasion. We are now going to use some blue oil based food coloring. It is important to use oil based and not any liquid or gel based because the gel and the liquid will make the almond bark curdle up and thicken, which is the opposite of what you want to happen. Few drops of pink food coloring and you mix, mix, mix. Now you are going to take small globs of the white almond bark and place it throughout a sheet pan covered in foil. We can decorate it and place it wherever you want to but make sure that it has some space between the other two colors. Now it just add the other two colors in between the spaces and swirl it with a toothpick. Now add some sprinkles. The almond bark has been refrigerated for approximately 20 minutes or so. Now it is time to crush it up. You can use your hands, you can use your hammer, a meat pounder, whatever you'd like. The cool thing about this is whatever shape comes out makes it look like it's homemade. As always, thank you for watching Simply Elegans.
