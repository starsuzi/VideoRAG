 Hello, I'm gonna make some colored sand today but before I do I want to tell you that there's not very many places online to find how to color sand with anything but chalk pastel or basically that's it, this chalky pastel to color sand or salt salt and sugar you can use but if you use chalk and has those two color salt it's not really good for making things like this this is what I'm trying to get into and I have a few that I've been wiping on but I've been trying to color sand and I've been using almost every technique possible I used acrylics from Walmart little 25 cent bottles I used spray paint and used chalks I've used powder it is I've made the color I guess it's cornstarch and food coloring or food coloring you can use food coloring but a lot of those don't work I've been almost months and months and months making colored sand and it's not worked out none of it's ever worked out I finally found a recipe that works if you're getting into doing sand art because here at the top to seal these off I have to put glue and water in it and to do that some of the water soups down just a bit and when it does if you have if you use chalk or pastels they'll bleed they'll have the colors will run together and they'll look real fuzzy I believe sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't but you can see here where it's the colors are faded together I don't really like like that but like this right here it's faded together here the basically the the chalk had just out they're just out completely just went together with the other colors some stayed together some didn't but I mean it's pretty good for the most part I just started about a month ago doing these and some like this I did this about three days ago and I'm still working at it but I don't like how the black got into the yellow or the orange of the green I need to be a lot more cleaner on that but just another lesson there's a purple one to look but for these right here I have to put water and seal it around the edges and this right here I didn't seal it and you can see it's kind of got a little fuzzy and got a little fuzzy there so let's just next time I'll do that we can fix it right and there's another one I did it has a little seam there's a top and the seam around it a lot of people want to take pictures or shoot videos of their their work they really don't turn the whole thing around they just show you one side of it basically you can't see what's on the other side or how it's supposed to come together and it's another thing is that you can't really find any place to learn how to do this like you can find places to teach you how to do painting or making something or craft or any kind of thing you want to do on YouTube but this is the only thing I've found that you really don't have a teacher for it's basically somebody that's in Dubai or in Brazil holding a camera behind someone and just shooting it and you basically have to guess at what they're doing they don't really explain how anything goes on but I did this one about three weeks ago but if there's anybody out there that can show you how to do this me also also there's another place is Japan they do aren't like this right here this is where I got most of my ideas for this was someone in Japan or China or I'm not for sure where they're from but there's not really many places to learn how to do this but what you're going to need today is a whisk some sand I use I got some beach sand from corpus water some detergent some some soap for dishes that you don't have to have any brand or anything like that lavender scent is what mine is mine is going to have a lavender scent sand smell per which I guess it smells okay I have a plastic fork a couple of cups of dixie cups and a spatula and this right here is one of my other videos is a fish net that you can find at Walmart Pesturs they're very cheap you're basically almost nothing but it gets the sand to almost really fine if you have if you're working with with dirt or other sand like from Kalichir or something like that you can also do that but I have some sand and stuff from the lake that I've used them broken down and turned into powder and it basically almost turns into like flour with this but um what you do is you get this and basically shake it up sorry if I ran belong this is one of the videos I've been trying to make for a while but I wasn't ready till now I'm still not ready but I'm gonna try to do this as quick as possible and as panelists as possible so I got all the stuff out there's a little bit of kind of just that takes out all the little stuff since it's from the beach it's gonna have little shells and kinds of different things you just throw that away okay oh and another thing I forgot to add on there is the paint I'm using acrylic paint for this one um this one's a master touch acrylic paint here and it's florist and pink um if you go with these you might be able to uh I noticed that these work a lot better and I'll show you later on what they look like after they're done um but with this type of brand spend the money to get these it's worth it at the end I think if not then you can use the Walmart brand little bottles and you're not going to get the same the same amount you can get this at Hobby Lobby or Michaels or any other art store um with this um I don't know how much to put in into this um but sorry got kind of fuzzy there let me get that back onto auto focus okay um with this you kind of just eyeball it however much you want I'm not really measuring it um also with the water if you have a dixie cup it basically I put um about half a cup of water half a cup of water I guess you can kind of see the line right there maybe a little a little less than half um you put in the um soap however much you think um I'll go ahead and do I'll go ahead and get some water and when you put this soap in and just put you know like maybe guess to have teaspoon or so you don't eat very much just just enough you can kind of guess at it I'm and put this open after you put the water on and shake it with a fork or something like that because you don't want it to sed make it roast bubbly in there but you're not going to use the whole thing either you're just going to kind of eyeball it to see there's a kind of text to there after you get it done okay once you get the water the paint in first then the water and soak together we start low out of time I left some sand out here I left some sand out here which I should have sifted um if you make it too soggy then what you can do with that is um if you put too much water and you think it's too soggy just add some more sand in that's basically basically and you don't have to or you don't have to put in too much just enough to make it a little bit more thicker oh what I used a whisk for was when you have the sand in here you usually you can put a lot in here but you can sift this around and it pushes it up faster that way you can or you can use a rolling pan that doesn't have handles on there of course but anything that'll get it out of there really fast but that's what I used that for you can use just for the sand or you can use a spatula I'm going to just stretch it a little bit better so you just uh you just keep mixing it mixing it until it gets the right consistency and the right consistency is going to be like icing it's gonna look quite icing well yeah I guess I did use the whole the whole thing but you want to add a little at a time just to kind of do it in there now I don't have a mixer or anything if you want to mixer I guess that won't hurt either basically keep mixing the mix and I'm not adding my editing my video I'm just kind of kind of getting it together here and this is my third third color work with and when I figured this this part out I kind of was so happy that I finally figured something out um same kind of works also you might have to put in more paint because that might not be enough paint you can also use food coloring for this also or you can use the combination of food color and paint of this paint and food coloring but see I'm adding more into it and the more color you have into it the more vibrant it's gonna be and I'm not for sure I found this video from someone that um did it from Brazil and I don't speak Portuguese I think it's Spanish but I can't speak Portuguese but I kind of had to piece together what he had to say
