 I'm going to keep it today. I'm going to keep it to the bottom of it. Oh, this is the cat. I'm going to finish it. First you're going to make sure there's no extra soda. You're going to break off to take a bit. I think I'm going to make sure you get it right. And then some people will be able to keep this thing work. Because later I'm going to eat it. Or maybe a sharp lobster. Okay, I heard you drink it. This is part right here. You're going to sit. It's so easy. I should have one like that. I'm going to put it in the fridge. I'm going to put it in the fridge. I'm going to put it in the fridge. I'm going to put it in the fridge. I'm going to put it in the fridge. I'm going to put it in the fridge. I'm going to put it in the fridge. This is the last person to leave the studio. I'm going to put my hands on fire. And the girls will do whatever it takes. It is super quick. It is super quick. It is super quick. See? You're the meter. This is the weird one. Look at it. It's not just for all condos need yet all. So next, right here, you'll see this under your gonna scratch the paint. You're gonna scratch the panel, put it in that area right there. Next, you're gonna get the sharp object, and you're gonna wait and make very tiny incisions. Let's see if it's in there. It's again in the floor. I'm gonna scratch the panel, I'm gonna scratch the panel. Don't use an eye because it cuts through a bit to make it sharp. I'm gonna scratch the panel. I'm gonna scratch the panel. I'm gonna scratch the panel. I'm gonna scratch the panel. Okay, trouble. There's way too much water in here. You wanna put the house? Well, I'm gonna turn on the grandma. We're gonna fix the car. We're gonna come over. We're gonna be done. What did I call you? They can be a little bit. So that's where you're gonna put it? I didn't. You're gonna put your mouth on the can. Now you're gonna need to cut whichever way you hold it. You're gonna need to make it on this side, the corners. On this side. Now this one you can use a knife on, and do it gently, because you don't want it to make. Sorry, what am I doing with that? There's no way for me to walk it. That's when 15 minutes of game. Before the overtime was for the turn of the water on our door. I'm sorry, I can't. But no one's gut harm, so you're set for Barbara. How are we doing, Bob? Nice. Months? It's probably been like half a month. I wish we could cut it up a meal. So my car's here. That big. Well, I got an arm. I could get this party started up in here. I'm part of the side.
