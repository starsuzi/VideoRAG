 Hi, I'm Eric Grant from Sailrite and this is Iron On Roman Rib Tape. Iron On Roman Rib Tape 1 inch is an easy no-so way of attaching ribs or dowels to the backside of Roman shades. This adhesive backed twill tape will iron on to the back of your shade application and contains a pocket that houses the rib or dowels. Iron On Roman Rib Tape is great for adding extra ribs to existing Roman shades or for easily making custom shades. Here you can see us attaching the Iron On Roman Rib Tape to the backside of a decorative fabric. Once the tape is in place, we can insert a Roman Shade Plastic Quarter-In Rib or a wooden doubt into the opening of the sleeve. We do not recommend laundering shades with Iron On tape unless it's been sewn down. Iron On Roman Rib Tape is available in a few colors at Sailrite.com.
