 Hello, Justin Jot here. Now I got this box the other day full of all kinds of wonderful blasters including this one here, this lovely Busbee Tommy 12. Now this is a video about how to deal with this namely battery corrosion because you can see this here both terminals all the terminals are really heavily corroded and these are the batteries that were left in the blaster for so long that they started to leak. Now just to talk to you a little bit about battery chemistry, potassium hydroxide is the electrolyte in the battery the thing involved in exchanging the electrons which flow through the circuit. Now in acid batteries we would have a modium wall zinc chloride doing that but it's potassium hydroxide in this case and when batteries get old they leak and this potassium hydroxide is quite corrosive it's quite nasty stuff it can irritate and things but then when it gets in contact with the air around it it gives you potassium carbonate you can see there's lots and lots of this stuff right there. Now this is actually a basic substance that means that if you dissolve it in water you would end up with a solution you'd correct me if I'm wrong which would be alkaline which means that in order to shift this stuff we simply need to react it with an acid and we have an acid right here vinegar so what I'm going to do is I'm going to in front of you now I'm going to try and do this whole process on camera I'm going to open this up I'm going to just squirt a little bit of vinegar onto here oops that's a bad camera work right there so there's a bit of a lovely distal vinegar maybe I should have used a bit of mulb vinegar to kind of have it sharpened on camera more and if I just show you this I'm just going to try and find a bit of potassium hydroxide in here and I've just dorked it on and the camera is really really bad you can't see it but it just kind of hisses and fizzes and sort of disappears it's not really disappearing what's going on is potassium hydroxide is reacting with a vinegar there's a neutralization reaction which occurs there is this kind of fizzing which you can hear where hydrogen's given off and and and that means that basically it's easier to shift because as it's like this it's quite it's quite a harmful substance but also and there is there is corrosion occurring to the terminals too it's quite reactive and for example you don't get up with your copper components oxidizing in here if it was kind of you know getting in contact with the copper or whatever it is so anyway so I'm going to do is I'm just going to door this onto here and I wish the microphone was good enough to pick this up because there's this fizzing that you can hear and I'm going to do all of this on camera if I can see it. As you may or may not be able to see this is now a lot cleaner than it was so now I'm going to dry it out and see if I can get some batteries working in it. In cotton buds are perfect for this because they can get into like the kind of places where you'd struggle to get with a bit of paper towel. I'm not actually going to bother drying it out completely because that should work just fine now I'm going to take three more batteries from my spare battery bag and I'm going to whack them in and then see if it's working now the thing is that this may well be so badly corroded that as you like the corrosion might have got through to the the rest of the circuit in which case will be will be struggling a bit but I think that there we go and you can hear now the batteries have gone in I've left it on being the monkey that I am and this now is working absolutely fine all the corrosion has been removed and you turn this off even there's a little button there to turn it on and off so there you go my purpose for this video was to simply show you how easily this battery corrosion can be removed and you can see those batteries were a real estate and that white feathery stuff was literally all over those terminals and all that stuff has not disappeared it is now in there dissolved in the partly water partly acid because the neutralization reaction which occurred has meant that that is now not pure acid there's also some that's going to be quite a dilute acid because of the water and this blaster is now working just fine so I hope that's useful for some of you if you have a bioblaster where you have nasty battery corrosion like this you know exactly what to do just one quick note do check whether the batteries are alkaline batteries or zinc chloride batteries acid batteries remember using chloride or ammonia chloride ammonium chloride and that is an acid you can't neutralize acid with acid and so if you have acid then you need to dissolve something like bicarbonate soda in some water and then it works exactly the same but do check whether it's now clined battery or an acid battery thanks for watching this is just a job signing off I know I said I was going to do this in one take but it occurred to me after I finished the video that it might be a much more amusing thing to do to show you the fizzing by putting these batteries in here and by just spraying the acid over them might be able to hear the fizzing like that so I'm going to go ahead and take these outside just in case anything that's happened did we do hello plants these are the batteries I got out and I'm literally just going to spray acid all over them and and hopefully there you can hear the fizzing and see the fizzing that's why I have been to the stuff on the terminal this is actually quite cool I might just kind of encourage this to fizz a little bit more
