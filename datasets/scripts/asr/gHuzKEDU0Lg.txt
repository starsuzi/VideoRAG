 Today we are making the Duck Farts Shot. The story behind this drink is that in Alaska at a bar when it was slow an old woman in the bartender were making drinks. And this is what they came up with. And apparently the old woman had a funny burp. And here it is the Duck Farts Shot. Let me show you how to make it. To make the Duck Farts Shot we will need... ...Colua... ...Balees Irish Cream... ...and the traditional recipe calls for crown. I only have crown apple but you can use whatever whiskey you so desire. We start off by putting a little clua in the bottom of the glass. Now we get our spoon in our Irish cream and layer that on. And lastly we are going to get the spoon again and our whiskey and we are going to layer that on top. The Duck Farts Shot. Bottom's up. This is actually a really good shot. After hearing the name Duck Farts I was kind of dubious. The Irish Cream... ...The Calua... ...and the whiskey all work really well together to make a fantastic shot.
