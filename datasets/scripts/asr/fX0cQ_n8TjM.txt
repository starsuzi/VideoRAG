 First thing you want to do is set the saute setting on high and coat the bottom of your pot in oil. And then while we wait for that to warm up, if I could direct your attention over here, a really nice thing to buy if you're going to be cooking a lot of doll is one of these spice boxes. You get some containers for the seven spices you use in doll and these really handy spoons to measure out the ingredients. We'll get going. First thing you want to do, drop in two of these spoonfuls of the mustard seeds, saw the oil around a little bit and they should start sizzling. The next thing you want is two little teaspoons of the cumin seeds. This is asafoetida. You want just a half teaspoon of this. This is really pungent. If you're here right now, you'd be able to smell that. And the next thing you want to dump in is this is two cloves of garlic diced. So you don't want to cook that too long or it's going to start burning it. Then continue to dump in the following spices. Two teaspoons of turmeric. Two teaspoons of ground coriander. One teaspoon of garmasala. I do half a teaspoon of chili powder that you can taste the spice. You can probably get away with a whole teaspoon but you don't have a kick to it. It's all about frying up the spices. I don't see fried them all up. You're going to dump in the tomato. Woo! That is hot. I usually throw in four pinches of salt. So we've added the salt to all the spices. We sauteed it all together in the oil. Got a good aroma. So now you can go ahead and dump in the lentils. I pre-rinsed and washed these lentils three times. Four cups of water. Give it a good spin. Put a lid on that. Real quick. Pressure cook on high and crank that up to five minutes. When it's done, you can either quick pressure the release. But I like to personally just let it slow release to really soak in the flavor. And yeah, thanks for watching. That's there. One take. A quick dough and ends the pot.
