 What's up you guys and welcome to Team Edge. This is the heads off battle. We're gonna be trying to knock each other's heads off today. The loser of today's challenge, well that's tripping me out. I'm like why are you pointing up? The loser of today's challenge is gonna get their iPhone smashed. So there are some real consequences today to losing. Actually here's a little pull right there. Who do you guys think is gonna lose today? I don't want my iPhone broken. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Did I catch it? I can't see. So for our first round we have a little duel between Brian and Bobby. Let's go. Get your weapons boys. Whoever knocks the opponent's head off first wins that round. We have a total of three rounds today. If we get a tie we have a tie breaker but if somebody wins two then they win the overall video. All right Bobby you ready? Brian you're using the boat in three two one go. Oh Brian Bobby you got it out of here. Wait your head fell ahead. Bro I would have taken you out. You almost took off his head. From behind you look like a skeleton. This is the weirdest thing coming. Oh you missed he dodged it. Oh we got it. You're ahead. Oh my gosh. It's so hot in here. It looks like Bobby is the victor of that round. Now on to the next round. Remember this Brian? It's weird. You guys didn't even know how hot and uncomfortable this thing is. They've measured it and it's about 120 degrees inside of here and it's Celsius and the altitude is about like 8,000 feet. So for you guys. Oh this is going to be intense Brian. I'm a low fighter man. Wow. I'm a clean fighter. I don't want any punches to the goodies or any mild play no touching of the hair of face either. Alright bump gloves. Let's do it. Let's go. Alright I'm tired of dancing. Bump bump. Body shots. Body shots. It looks really what we do with our lives. Dang give us a freaking tall. Just tie them out. Shuffle. Shuffle. Shuffle. Just like the other one doing the most moving. Oh you have to block like this. Oh I'm tired. Just tie them out. Flying two months. So. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm looking to spin. Oh my god. It's hot. Brian takes the wind. He's down. So for our next round it's going to be Bobby versus Joey. Here's the thing. You're Bobby. You know what? Yeah he's a total jerk. We're going to be hiding on opposite sides of the entire building. Our goal is to find weapons then go get each other. So if the giraffe wins we're not to do a tie-breaker. If you win you win the entire video the entire challenge. Really? Yeah. Alright. Oh that's nice. So now I'm going to hide the weapons from J Fred and Bobby because they're dispersed somewhere in the office. They have to find their weapons before they get to attack each other. It's pretty simple. It's math really. Alright let's go this way. Alright ready. Let's do fight. See what we got here. Time for that vote again. We think it's going to win. Okay, Fred or Bobby. I'm good. Oh. Okay. Alright. Not even the same area right now. This is honestly the one of the creepiest videos I think we've made. I'm just going to go in for the kill. Make him a head up. Did you block this? Get him Bobby. He's reloading. Bobby's angry. Show him that dragon theory Bobby. Oh I'm in a bad spot. Get him Bobby. He's out of arrows. Oh I hit it. No. No. No. Oh Bobby's side. It's over Bobby. It's over. Get him here Joey. Yo. Oh he just dodged it. Oh gosh. Oh it's serious now. That sounded. Get him Bobby. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come on. Come on Bobby. You got the sword. He's got me. Oh god. He's down. Oh no. I'm in trouble. I'm so stupid. Bobby. Guys it was actually us in here. It wasn't these things. It wasn't really tall free people from East Ireland. Hey Bobby. So you want it? That's two victories for you. Hey that's two wins. I want to see the next challenge guys. There's the first time for everything. Now it is time for the punishment. Joey took the loss. So now I get to smash his iPhone. Good thing I backed it up. I've won. Bobby could I buy the rights to smash Joey's phone? Sure. So should we do it? Sure. You let me smash it for a sushi. Yeah. I've done a lot more for a lot less. We are playing our favorite song ever. Backwards by Matthias. Go check it out. So we'll see if it still plays after it's smashed. Tang it. Are you going for it or? Go. You win. This sucks. All right. These are my own emojis. Oh well that worked. Oh it's expanding. It's expanding. It's expanding. It really is. It's just like this. No it is. It really is. You hear it? No. It looks like I have to go to the Apple store now. Great. Luckily it's pretty easy. I'm going to go get a new iPhone. Here we go. Tang I'm jealous. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I don't want to like breathe in. It still works. Guys make sure you go check out the random object radar gun where we threw random objects in front of a radar gun to test how fast we could actually throw them. It was actually pretty interesting. Interesting. Interesting. Also go check out the crocodile finger chomper challenge also known as crocodile dentist where we got our fingers smashed and destroyed in a little crocodile.
