 Showy lilies and beautiful day lilies bring drama and color to any garden and because they're perennials you can to enjoy them every year. There are two main classes of lily, ageatic and oriental. Ageatic lilies are generally shorter, have upward facing flowers and bloom in early summer. They come in many different colors and bicolors and slowly expand in your garden every year. Their average height is about three feet. The lilies tend to be a little taller. If you live in a windy area, consider staking them to keep them from toppling. Oriental lilies bloom a little later than the ageatics. So if you blend them together, you will have lilies all summer long. Many orientals are also wonderfully fragrant. Dalilies, on the other hand, get their name because each bloom lasts for just a single day. But the plants themselves are so productive, you'll have blooms for weeks. Standard Dalilies grow about three feet tall. The trait they share with regular lilies is that the best time to plant them is in fall. This is the most common reed blooming Dalilies, Stella de Arro. It blooms from junta to frost, which makes it a really common landscape plant. There are a variety of colors and styles, all of which reed bloom. The flowers are smaller than the average Dalilie, but because they reed bloom you can depend on them for a long season of color. Both lilies and Dalilies require sunny location with six to eight hours of direct sun a day. The mantle lilies are slightly more shade tolerant. You can buy lilies and pots in the spring, but they're really best planted in the fall from bulbs. Once established, you don't need to dig them. Just leave them in place every year. A little extra planting this year can result in beautiful flowers next summer.
