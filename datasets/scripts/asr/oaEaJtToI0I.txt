 All right, I've got a whirlpool top load washer See the clothes in there. Yeah They're no agitator My model number is WDW 5000 DW1 Stop switch there let's switch whatever seems to be working good Yes, start it What it does It will fill up Run somewhat of a sensing slash wash cycle and then stop Sometimes it makes it to the rent cycle and then pauses But won't release the lid And then if you push the pause button After about two or three minutes it'll unlock the lid but it won't do anything else Not sure what's going on Everything set to normal Oh Yeah, I hot wired the lid switch just to check to see if it was the actual lid switch and it's not so that's working properly Minus that I have no idea what's going on Any help would be appreciated See you guys
