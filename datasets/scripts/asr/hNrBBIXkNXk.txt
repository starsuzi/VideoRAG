 Non-taxic way to kill spiders or any insect, I really like these tarot sticky traps. There's no chemicals involved, it's just an adhesive that's inside this trap and it's designed so you can put it up against the wall where most spiders and insects crawl. They come into this, they get trapped and then they die. So instead of putting down toxic chemicals, sprays and powders, you place these around the house. One of these boxes comes with four traps, very easy to assemble and once the spiders and insects are caught in this, you just throw them away and put up a new one.
