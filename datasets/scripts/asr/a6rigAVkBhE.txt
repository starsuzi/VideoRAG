 Hi, Stephanie from eFoodDihydrator.com. I get a lot of questions about the Swiss Mar, Man the Lens Lister that I use in our videos. And I actually sell this on my website too for about $44.95 that includes shipping. But this is an awesome unit and it's really going to last for years. It's by a company called Swiss Mar and this one is the Taj Mahal of Flicers. This one I use primarily for most of my slicing. And it's actually a really nice unit with a stainless steel blades and it's so easy to wash or you can put in your dishwasher as well. And it comes with these different slices, Julianne or quarter inch slices or half inch and this is what you'll do is if you want to use this typically I don't but it's a good safety good way to keep safe. And this is what I'll do. Right now I'm using about the quarter inch slices which I love for my apples. And you just simply do this one handed. Some of the units don't come with this handy catcher but I would highly recommend it. And on my apples I would put a little lemon juice on there, lemon juice and water mix. 75% lemon juice, about 25% water. And don't they look really great? They're nice and slim but you can control that. You can make them a little thicker or you can cut them like small potatoes too. Like the Julianne style. But this is really a great unit. And like I said I sell it proudly on my website www.efooddhydrator.com and you can ask Stephanie any questions about food dehydrators or stainless steel dehydrators or our oxygen absorbers or our slicers.
