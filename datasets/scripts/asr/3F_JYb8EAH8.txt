 Okay, so in the past I've done videos on how to keep bugs and insects out of your pantry. Now if you haven't seen those videos, I'll leave links down below so you can watch them. But today's video is like an extra layer protection that will also help keep bugs out of your containers. So you've got containers like flour or rice or pasta and all you need is a bay leaf. So with a bay leaf just on top of that flour there, it'll help keep any bugs or insects out of the flour. Now it's not going to work with 100% of insects, but for insects like moths or weebos it'll help keep them out of your flour. And of course it'll also work with your pasta and your rice, pretty much anything that you're going to keep in a container that is food. And to make things even more economical, I'll leave a link down below to my video on how to grow your own bay tree. So have an endless supply of bay leaves.
