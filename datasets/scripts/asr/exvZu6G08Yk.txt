 Today I want to show you how to make a bottle tree look as great at night as it does during the day. This is a bottle tree. I found this one locally in Fort Worth at Old Homes Supply. It's a historical architectural salvage company that has a wide array of products and they just happen to carry these bottle trees. You can use wine bottles, liquor bottles, or bottles that are readily available from your local craft stores. Now just keep in mind that bottles from your craft store may have a layer of paint on them that will wear off when you expose them to sunshine, but you know it's going to give it a nice vintage feel. Now the great thing about these bottle trees is that they add a bit of whimsy to your garden, but most of that occurs during the day by adding lights we can really make them sparkle at night. Now what I've done for this project is to use craft lights. I've used two styles, 20 lights to the stream and 35 lights to the strand. Now the 20 light strands, those are perfect for wine bottles where the 35 light strings are really nice for your larger craft bottles and larger liquor bottles. You just feed the lights into the bottle through the top. No need to drill a hole. And then after just slide your bottle, don't get your finger stuck. Then slide your bottle gently over the limbs, making sure not to damage the wiring. And then just turn it on. Pull it up! You can choose to fill all of your bottles or just a few. This is a quick and easy project and I hope you have as much fun with your bottle tree as I have with mine. I'm Shelley at Christmas Light Source.
