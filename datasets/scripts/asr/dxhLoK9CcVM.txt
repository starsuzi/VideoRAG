 Hi, I'm Charlotte Lawson, a registered in licensed dietitian here in Tampa Bay, Florida. I'm going to give you a little bit of information on the Flaxseed and how to really utilize its benefits. Flaxseed more and more has been up and coming as far as its health benefits for us and reducing our risk for other health diseases. Flaxseed is high in fiber and high in our MEGO3 fatty acids that have improved into help lower triglycerides and help increase our HDL, which is the good cholesterol in our body. Now to utilize this Flaxseed, really the best form is in its ground form. If we eat it whole, for instance, sprinkled as the whole seed on a salad or maybe even in a sandwich, our body actually passes the seed completely through without being utilized whatsoever. And part of that's just because of its high fiber content. Now when you actually can grind it up, whether you've decided to buy the whole seeds and grind them in a food processor, or you can buy it in a powdered ground form, then add this to say cereals or even baked products. It's easily blended into a lot of things and then you actually get the full benefit of the fiber and those in MEGO3 fatty acids. There's also some on Flaxseed butters, just kind of like other nut spreads. This again can go on a sandwich or on a waffle in the morning, also an easy way to utilize the full benefits of Flaxseed. Now it's an excellent thing to add to any healthy diet. And again, if you want to get it in different forms, just remember the ground way is the best way to go. I'm Charlotte, and I'd happy.
