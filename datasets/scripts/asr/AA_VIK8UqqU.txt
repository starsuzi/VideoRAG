 Hey guys today me and Andrew are going to be trying these checks muddy buddies. Are they all muddy buddies? Yes. Check it out. Check snakes muddy buddies. Candy wants us to measure these out because the calories are all a little different. I love YouTubers recommended that we give these a try. They were going to fraud these out. They were $2.99 and Target. Actually I think one of them came from Walmart but it's okay, it doesn't matter. There's some pretty much ever. I have, we'll just go through the flesh. I have browning supreme. And we also have cookies and cream. Real 50 crumbs. And we also have peanut butter and chocolate which is the one I'm looking for. But I'll try the cookies and cream for us. Because I think that'll be the bowl. But we're doing 33 grams. 33 grams is a mess cup serving. Okay so many grunts. I mean not still a grunt. Wow they smell fantastic. Smell good. They smell like a favorite. How many grain do we have? We're going for 33. 33. Close, close. You're almost there. Couple more. One more. Two more. There you go. That's 33. And how many calories is that? One 50. So that is 150. I think these cups are these two cups. These are one cup cups. So that's about a half. That's supposed to be half a cup. Well that's almost dead on a half cup then. That's pretty close. I think. All right. You want to eat that in that? Yeah sure. I'm bad. I have a white chocolate flavor to them. I think you can taste a lot of the cereal in there. Yeah. You can really taste the cereal. I thought they might be filled. But they're not. No they're just covered. They're just cereal. Check cereal covered in a coating. The coating? No we saved more of them I guess. Yeah there's more. There is a good, good, decent cream flavor there. I don't have a lot of them. I can't worry about a blizzard that I play around top of it. Yeah. You don't have to take my word on that. No. Because it ain't strong. No it's very light. It's not super sweet either. All right. That was okay. That went by the way. Would you by the way? No. Not that. Maybe one of these other ones will sit. We're going for 25 grams. And this is the chocolate brand of your frozen? This is a brandy supreme. Brandy supreme. And you get how much? You're getting a third of a cup. So 25 grams, 110 calories. Not whatever. Like money, then. Yeah. You get there a couple of hours until you get there. You could buy it by. Well we got to eat that. That's true. You get this gracious. How many cups? How many cups do you get? You get 25. That's it. Banned. Got it. Well it's definitely less than half. Oh that's a third. Okay. Yeah. That's right. That's probably about a third of that one cup cup. So. I'm going to eat just eat my whole thing. Now these seem to be better covered. They're coated better. And they taste better. Mm-hmm. Way, way better. Do you have a look at these? These seem to be covered better. They're thicker. They're completely coated. These remind me of a cook-up of cereal or something. There's a chocolate cereal that tastes like that. Well I'm going to be honest with you guys. These are fantastic. Why don't you put these in milk? Why don't they taste like milk? Why don't you have a little bit of course in milk and that little content? I'm probably pretty good actually. You get already contains milk too. Those are really good. I like the brownie. Yeah the brownie ones. I did like it. You don't get very much for the calories. That's the one part. This is 28 grams. That's 30 for 130. So 130 for this is the end of it. Any water? Yeah. Those are pretty well coated too. Look. Almost. No. Close enough. Yeah that's the brownie. That looks more like a little more than that looks like two force. Well not two force. But no, I think that's about 30 for a cow. These do look like they're not... They're in between the coatings of the other two. I agree. Although I don't see a lot of cereal in this one. Poked fruit like that. That first one you saw a lot of cereal poking fruit. Definitely digs peanut. I definitely get the peanut butter. The chocolate is very... Oh good chocolate. Is this egg chocolate? Yeah. I don't think I'm going to be on chocolate at all. It tastes like a chocolate peanut butter. Yeah. It's very faint. Oh that's not very strong. Those are good but my favorite of the brownies. And hannies now. Yeah. That's about far. Peanut butter would be my second and then the cream is just like... Look at this. I mean, I'm just going to grab randomness here. Look at the coating. Oh yeah big difference. Like this has a thick... The brownie and I know you can't see these. I'm good. That's the three different ones. And you can tell... That's a cookies and cream. Yeah. That's the brownie and that's the... The brownie has an actual thick coating on it. That separates it by far from the other two. Yeah. It's alright. They're all decent. The brownie is my least favorite one. I don't even think it's worth buying. Of course you get more of it too. The brownie by far in a way is the best one. Yeah. Excellent. Super chocolatey. So yeah. I hope you enjoyed this video and thanks for watching. Thanks for watching.
