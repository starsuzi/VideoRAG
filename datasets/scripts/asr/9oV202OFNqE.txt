 The TGS Gofer Bate Applicator works, where others cannot, in hard or rocky ground, under sidewalks, patios or foundations. First, find the problem area, then locate a feeder hole in the vicinity of the mound, and expose the Gofer Tunnel. Clear the entrance to the tunnel. Load your TGS applicator with a bait of your choice, and insert it into the open hole. It works with any bait. Place the applicator as far as possible into the ground. Depress the control handle and remove in a shaking motion. Once the applicator has been removed completely, bury the hole to protect surface animals and prevent the targeted Gofer from surfacing. The applicator will also work on any burrowing animal, including squirrels. It will be safe, effective, easy to use.
