 Okay, so first we have fiddle head, yeah perfect. Okay, so we've got fiddle head ferns. Okay, they look kind of funky by the way, right? They look almost like I always say they look like, they should be in a cauldron with somebody like stirring them, but they really taste amazing. They taste like a cross between asparagus. Here, I'm gonna pour these right out of the deck. They look exactly like the top of a fiddle head. Right, they look crazy. They look a little bit like asparagus with a little nutty flavor. Here we go. I think they're super, super delicious. You can give those a toss. We're gonna add a little pepper. That's a little coconut oil. They're all used coconut oil because that has a high smoke point. They're also loaded with vitamin C, which is obviously good for your immune system, vitamin A, good for your skin. Also packed with fiber to help keep you full, and they're just delicious. Let's be as fresh as you're there. It's really, really pretty. So with any lean protein or salmon, or lean piece of steak or tofu, it's just delicious. And I like to finish a simple saute veg just for the little light lemon juice over the top two, really makes it kind of pop. Absolutely delicious. And like you just said, with any sort of protein, I like to get greens in actually three times a day, if I can, but I always recommend twice.
