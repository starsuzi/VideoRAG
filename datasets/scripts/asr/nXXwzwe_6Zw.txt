 This is an amethyst geod completely filled with crystal drizzle of very sharp points and hundreds of rainbows. This is nearly five inches in diameter and this is from my own collection of more than 15 years. This is from Minnes Gerais, Brazil. All of the points have perfect termination and very high luster. There's no calcite covering and this took so much work because if you look right here you can see light goes through the very very thin spot right there where somebody had to be extremely careful in finishing it and light glows through the whole thing. And it's about five inches.
