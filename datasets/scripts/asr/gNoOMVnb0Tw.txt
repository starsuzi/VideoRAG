 Hey everybody! In today's Healthy Basics video, I'm going to show you how to make cashew milk, which is my favorite of all of the different nut milk options. It's super creamy and unlike almond milk, you don't have to strain it, which is a huge benefit and it also makes it really fast and simple to make. So let's dive in! Place one cup of raw cashews in a container and cover them with water. Let these soak for at least 4 hours, though I usually let them soak overnight. Once they're done, drain them in a colander and give them a good rinse. Add the cashews to a high-powered blender, along with 4 cups of water, 1 to 2 tablespoons of your favorite sweetener, a little vanilla extract and salt. Then blend everything together on high for a minute or so until milky and creamy. And that's it! Transfer the cashew milk to a storage container and place it in the refrigerator.
