 Hey everyone, so date tutorial is on Karelo and Jensley. If you don't use this then I don't think you will watch this but I don't know. Just stay tuned if you like are gonna use it or something. So yeah. And if you do use this to make charms, you probably notice whenever you like make a pretty detailed charm. So I'm just rolling a ball and there are some cracks like right there and all you need is water to do this. So different fingers are into water. And then if you see that cracking spot, I'll just smooth out it with your hand. I mean your finger, sorry. And guess what? It will dry out like the way you did it. And we smooth it out. And once you do this, there are cracks at the side. I guess what? You use the same trick again. So the water basically holds it together. And yeah. So this is like a trick to use detailed charms, charms but don't do this. Don't just pretend you just don't dump your play into the water. That's wrong. That's what's the dumb replay in the water. You're supposed to use your fingers and smooth it out like that. But don't just dump it in like that and be like, yeah, it's done. So yeah, thanks for watching this tutorial. And if you guys knew this already, then good for you. Yeah, thanks for watching. Bye!
