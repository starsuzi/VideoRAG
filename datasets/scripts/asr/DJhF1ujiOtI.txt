 Hi this is Kim with our experimental hanging toofa pot. It's kind of bright sunlight. It's a little hard for me to see but this is what I've made. I'm washed in the sides as well as I could by doing the pie crust action, press with your thumb, push in on the sides and I'm getting ready to wrap it. I've got it sealed on all the sides and then underneath you can see how it kind of bulges and I pulled the plastic up fairly tight. I mean while I got all the chain out of the way but I'm hoping it will get the imprint of a little flurdily. I'm not really sure what to call that but I'm just precisely fit this particular container. So what I'm going to do now is to take this whole portion and just fold in the plastic to hold it in and just set it aside and then I'm hoping since I've set it on the surface that it will have a slight level bottom so that I can set it down on a pot on the ground if I would want to later on but that's the hanging pot. I'll keep my fingers crossed.
