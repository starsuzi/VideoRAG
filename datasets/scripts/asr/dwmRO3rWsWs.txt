 Welcome to Sessrek Huskitchen. Today I am going to make raw papaya salad. First I am going to peel the papaya and then grate it. Here I am sharing my papaya. I am sharing grating into this size. Here is my grated papaya. I am going to add some turmeric, some salt, cilantro and I am squeezing some fresh lemon juice. Mix it. Here I have some garlic and green chillies. I am going to make a paste in the good processor. Here I have my garlic and green chilli paste. I am going to add it here. Just mix it. You can mix with 2 forks. Papaya contains an enzyme called papayin and papayin reduces the risk of gastrointestinal problems. I am going to add a little bit of brown sugar to it. Papaya is also rich in vitamin E and vitamin C. It has more healing properties. Just mix everything well and taste it if you need some more salt or lemon juice. You can adjust for your taste. You can use this as a salad or chutney. If you want it as a 100% raw food, you can just leave it like this. Or if you want a little tempering on the top, you can do that. Pan is hot and I put 1 teaspoon of ghee and you can use oil also. I am using some fenugreek seeds. Mustard seeds. Cumin seeds. And some paprika. Crushed red chilli. And some hing as a potato. And some chopped garlic. And adding this to my papaya cake. It smells very good. Ok my raw papaya chutney is ready. Thank you for watching and please give it a try and let me know how it came out. Thank you and we will meet in my next video.
