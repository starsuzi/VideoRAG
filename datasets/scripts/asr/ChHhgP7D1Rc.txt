 Hello Namaste Salam Walekum Sathrikal. Welcome back to another session with your watch chef at www.warawad.com. Today I am going to show you how to make Batura. If you remember I showed you how to make Chole and Puri but a lot of you have been asking me to show how to make this Batura. In fact I have more than 450 requests that are already lined up but we do not have too many funds to do all this but we are hoping to generate revenues from various sources so that we can support this show and this show keep producing a lot of this show so you all can benefit. I wanted to read a couple of the names of the people who had the courage to go and say thank you to the watch chef by clicking the thank you button at warewa.com. It started with Satya Ganta, Sri Kant Kone Ru, Govind Raju, Raju Patel, Kamal Arora, Nira Vakil, Devadak Mahanti, Vikram Narah, Peter Weber, Sri Hari Raya Varupu, Kiran Kumar, Mallikar Juna Boda and others who said thank you in a bigger way or Sotaka Kothel, Bell Y.V. Kuthwa, Adeline Lapudula, David Hanson, Suresh Bandaroo, Sai Kirola and we also have a mega thank her that is Vinod Thangara and our supreme donor for this last two weeks is Rajesh Betapuri so I want to thank you all trust me with all these donations we have not even covered the cost of making one video so you can imagine how much it takes to produce this show. It takes almost 25 man hours to produce one show the shooting the lighting the camera and editing and so on. So I can only request you all to be more courageous. In fact I've got a small solution you can have a small glass in your kitchen you can write warewa on it whenever you like one particular dish and you made it your husband came and give you a big kiss and said wow this is beautiful all your kids come running and saying mummy I love this dish this is beautiful all you do take a dollar put in that glass collect a couple of dollars have the courage go and say thank you to your washer so that when your kids grow up go to college they have a website where they can see it for free because I don't expect students or the people who cannot afford to donate so I know there are very few percent of the people who will donate but those are the people who will run this website free so that many of those people can benefit from this show so with that said I'm going to start today's recipe that is Batura so for this Batura I put around two cups of Maida that is all purpose flour and salt just enough for this baking powder for two cups use less than half a teaspoon and half a teaspoon of sugar once you add the baking powder sugar salt just mix it okay so that this mixture is really good okay and in the restaurants see what happens in restaurants we make Batura and it has to go to the table and it still has to look puffed up so to do that you can add some suji just use quarter cup less than quarter cup do not add too much add three fourth cup of buttermilk okay now you can add milk or water to make the rest of the dough so just mix this little bit do not add too much water make a little bit tighter dough because you're going to let this dough rest for maybe a couple of hours make at least two hours you let this dough rest that way it will become softer in the two hours you can see that the dough has nicely absorbed all the water and it is not very soft it is slightly tight dough so all you do is add take some oil just sprinkle on top just mix it one more time okay after you're done with the dough just cover it and leave it aside for at least two hours and after that you can make your Batura and they will come really awesome I've let this dough rest for almost two hours and then I took this dough and made into a small dumpling just like you make chapati or puri depending on the size of Batura you want you make the dough into that size so what I'm going to do since I applied little bit oil I don't need to use any flour make Batura with this simple just roll it in all directions see another thing when you're rolling a Batura you have to remember is it has to be even in all sites okay if you have one side very thin and the other side thick your Batura will not come out good okay make sure your oil is hot take this spoon like this on one hand and lift your Batura so see when you're making a big Batura just drop it in the oil just like this and then immediately make sure you press it with the spoon because this pressing will press the bubbles okay if there's any bubbles in there it will press the bubbles and it will make your Batura rice big okay see you have okay just keep pressing it and you will see your Batura rice big okay look at how nice beautiful it is ah look at this wow see now it's become like a balloon okay without pressing you will never get a Batura like a balloon like this see the difference between puri and Batura rice Batura is made much bigger usually and it is got nice flavoring of yogurt and sweetness of little bit sugar whereas in the puri you make it with ahata whereas Batura is made with Maida I hope you have enjoyed learning today's session of how to make Batura and I hope some of you will have the courage to go and say thank you at Vahrehvah.com and also remember that Vahrehvah is all about inspiring others to cook so please post your recipes and cooking tips so others can benefit from no great cooking thank you
