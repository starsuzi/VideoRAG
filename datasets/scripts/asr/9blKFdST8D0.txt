This is gonna be one last foot recipe, or Vietnamese foot recipe, of this year here. Let's get into this. First things first guys, I have 12 quarts of water here. I'm not gonna water it doesn't really matter because right now we are cleaning the bone. The reason why we do clean this bone is because we want a clear, nice broth. So I got two racks of beef ribs throwing in. I don't care if you can swim. Just get in. Next thing that goes in, beef tendon. Every but out, everybody in the pool. We're gonna clean this bone and tendon for 20 minutes guys. 20 minutes up, I'm gonna jump this whole stock right here. Gonna take our bones and we're just gonna wash off all these crumbs on there. I'm gonna fill my pot back up to 12 quarts of water. Once I got 12 quarts, put it back onto the fire. And goes our clean beef bones. And our tendon. Next, I'm gonna char up two small onions. I only got two small onions. If you have one large onion, go ahead, just one large onion. One ginger. Every time I smell this smell guys, I think of it now. This is the smell of it now. We're here. Chard Aromatics. So everybody into the pool. 10 star needs. You guys don't know where to find star needs. You can find it at any Asian local supermarket guys. Star needs has this black licorice taste to this guys. It's amazing. One cinnamon stick. I wanna say three tablespoons of coriander, but I only have this much left. So if you guys have coriander seeds, they're already in. Last but not least, rock sugar or if you guys don't have rock sugar, which I don't, brown sugar. So one heaping scoop of that. And that's it guys. We're gonna let this sit for five hours. The longer it sits, the tastier it will be guys. As we wait, I got vermicelli or bun foot right here. The dry brand. So the brand I'm using is the triple girls brand. All I'm gonna do is put some warm water in it and let that soak. So this stuff needs to get rehydrated before we start cooking it. Not a lot of people know about this or I usually just eat this with a lot of pickle onions. Next time you guys make foot or eat foot, I want you guys to make this pickle onion. And tell me how it tastes. So we're just gonna chop up some onions. I don't know why I got these small onions. So we're just gonna thinly slice them guys. You must thinly slice them. Don't go in my speed guys. Just take your time. Work up to it. So to slice, I always slice that. I usually just rock my knife on the skin here or the piece of fat I have on my index finger. If you guys don't have that extra fat like I do right here, sorry guys. You guys won't be able to chop like this. You guys gotta eat a little more. Any chef needs me to come by, chop some onions for you or mushroom. I got you. I'm gonna do half of this portion for pickling and half of this portion for toppings of the foot. The pickling recipe is very simple guys. So I got chili flakes here, maybe go with one tablespoon. Get that good old crepe, I'm on hydrate. Sugar guys, two tablespoons of this, one cup of vinegar. That's it guys, just let that soak for the time being. Next topping for our foot, our green onion or some scallions. Oh, we're just gonna chop this down. Dust the lunch roll. Just like that. We got some fresh Thai basil. We got some lime. And to top off this plate, we got some Thai chili. And this is our toppings for our foot. So we got basil, we got some lunch roll, we got green onions, sliced onions, lime, chili pepper or Thai chili. Can't forget the bean sprouts. Just because this is our last foot recipe for 2017, I was gonna say 2016. I'm gonna do Chinese donut, just like the first time I ever did it. Shalathmoji's who remember it. Chinese donut recipe or my new recipe. So two cups of flour, one tablespoon of baking powder. I like mine on the little sweeter side. So if you guys want it on the sweeter side, two tablespoons of sugar or not, one tablespoon of sugar. One teaspoon of salt. Mix that in. Once I got that nice and mix, one cup of water. And goof so bad of hate cleaning this like this. It's okay. We're gonna fold it in. All we're looking for guys is a nice, persoft dough. Once we got this dough nice and rolled out, time to throw in the fridge covered 20 minutes. 20 minutes up, time to roll out our Chinese donut. So we take this, we take our rolling pin and we roll it out. We're gonna roll this out into a rectangle. Or a semi-close, to a rectangle. Next, we're gonna grab our Chinese cleaver. And we're gonna cut down an inch apart. It doesn't have to be perfect guys. To make your Chinese donut, you take your chopstick. You gotta have a chopstick to do this or just something like a chopstick. We take one piece of our dough, we're gonna stack it on top of the other. We're gonna take our chopstick. This is where the chopstick comes in. And we're gonna press right into the middle. We're gonna press it down very hard. If you guys missed this step, it's just gonna break apart in the fryer. We're gonna throw to the side. You know what? I want this a little smaller, so I'm gonna chop it. We got this nice and rolled out. I'm gonna start frying guys. So I have my oil heated up for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, I'm gonna drop it down to a 7. I'm gonna wait 5 minutes before we start frying our Chinese donut. After 5 minutes, I'm gonna stick my chops again. Once it starts bubbling, oil's ready to be used. Everybody in the pool. I don't care if you can swim. Just get in cooking time. Out. 40 to 50 seconds, guys. 50 seconds in or whatever desire liking you like. A color. Pull them out, guys. Pull them out and let them drain. As we wait for our Chinese donuts to fry, let's break open one. So it's nice, airy, chewy. Mmm. A little sweet. Not as sweet, not as sweet as I wanted to be, but I'm just adding no more sugar out there. What? Nice and hollow chewy. So let's just kind of eat the dunk this in my butt, bro. Last batch of this coming out. It's gonna be the best foot you'll ever sink your teeth into. I promise. Five hours in. I took out the beef bones already. I'm just leaving to the side. Kind of strain off these little bits and pieces. I'm gonna take my beef bone again, which I just took out earlier. And I'll just dump it back in. Time to season, guys. One tablespoon of salt going in. Last thing will be the fish sauce. So one tablespoon, taste and adjust for your own liking. Last thing going in are beef meatballs. Alright guys, we're eating this late just because I had some guests coming over. So we're gonna do our noodles. 30 seconds up. Pop up my noodles. Got some tendon. I got some rare beef inside round. I'm gonna throw in my beef balls. One beef rib, two beef ribs, raw onion, scallions, and cilantro. Nothing to it now, or broth. I'm gonna set this up. Got fried donuts. We got our pickles. Got our bean sprouts. Basil, Thai chili. That's it guys. There it is guys. This is our last bowl of for 2017. When are you guys coming by? Let's set this bowl up. I'm starving.
