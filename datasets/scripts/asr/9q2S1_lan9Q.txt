 Hey guys, it's Kaelin and today I'm probably by myself, but we're today we're gonna be doing Perlabees which I'm really excited for and I've actually done these before and I did it with a bigger one but for the first time in the video I'm just gonna be doing a smaller one today. We did the iron a little too long and it got a little bent and it's a little more liquidy on the bottom and yeah but it still turned out pretty good so be careful when you use the iron. Don't do it for too long and there's a lot of cute designs on this box and they actually come in a little piece of paper in the box that you can learn to do them on. So you're going to get the little instructions for the fusing a stencil and my bigger stencils upstairs but it's a big orange one like this and I have my beads down here right up here. You get two bags but I have one ported to a bowl right here and so yeah you get a little stencil but you also get a bigger one but mine's upstairs right now and you have a bunch of these that you can make see and oh oops so there's a lot of really cute ones you can make and there's also some on the other side and today I'm going to be making this one this little owl the blue and pink one and that one's used on the bigger stencil you can see that some of them are used on the bigger stencil this one's on the other one so and yeah so I'm going to be making so yeah today we're making a little blue and pink guy and that's on the little or stencil so I also recommend using tweezers and putting your beads in a bowl it's a lot easy to use and grab them out with the tweezers and stuff so all you're really going to do if you haven't seen these before is you take out the little beads and put them on the stencil and the design that you want so you can you can go from the paper you can go from the ones on the paper or you can just create your own which I'm going to be doing on the paper because I really like this little blue and pink owl so let's get started okay so I finished my owl and notice the gigantic mess on the table it's because I dumped it out so I could find it easier so this is what I came up with and I didn't entirely follow this because I most I followed it for the most part and then when it came to the little ear type horn things I wanted to add a cute texture and make them pink so I have all my beads on so right now I'm going to now I'm going to iron it but first I'm going to look at my dad because you shouldn't do this at an adult it's pretty dangerous okay hey we're back and we're doing the process after you've completed the design which is called fusion which is when you put the iron over the design to make it all smooth and complete it so one of the most important things for all the kids that are doing this is that you have to have an adult with you because it's very dangerous and I have my dad over here I've done it a few times by myself but I've always had my parents around so that's a good thing to know and the first thing you're going to do is here's the fusion instructions right here it comes on the design paper you need to place your design on the board on a heat safe surface and then you just set your iron to the medium setting and then place the ironing paper just the wax paper and it comes in the box so you have to place it over the pegboard and in a circular motion you get the iron and after you're done you're just going to let it cool so remember not to do it for too long or else it will melt some of the beads and they'll get a little gooey and it might ruin the board so make sure not to do it too long but make sure all the beads you can't really see their circles anymore and make sure they're just a closed flat surface on the top and you can't see the little circles that you hooked them on in okay so after all the cubes well the circles the beads are mostly all closed up and you can't see the holes on the top anymore you can take it off and let it cool and then you need to feel off the paper very carefully and then you have it but you can let it cool because it's really hot right now and yeah so that's it and after it's cooled for maybe 10-15 minutes you can peel it off and then you have it hey guys we're back and my little owl has dried so I'm going to show you it's really cute and it's been about I'd say 10 minutes so this one was little or so it didn't take as long to cool so we're just gonna you just gotta just peel it off and then you have here a little creature whatever you created and this turned out really good not like my last one we did a little too long but it was bigger so it's a little harder to tell when to turn it off so yeah you can I believe that you can do this to the other side but I'm just gonna keep it like this so you can display it whatever side you want and this is really fun I really recommend this to you guys and you don't even have to follow just the normal patterns that it gives you you can get creative and do whatever you want because you get a smaller stencil and you get a bigger one so you can basically do whatever you want and I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to like this video and subscribe for more fun videos so thanks for watching bye
