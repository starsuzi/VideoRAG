 problem with this washer and it's a simple fix so if it seems to stop for some reason anywhere partway through the load beginning, middle, and whatever, filling water, whatever. So here the machine stopped and if your machine happens to stop it's because the actual switch is up in here, the context switch, it's actually underneath of this whole thing has to go apart and the switch is actually up under here but the problem is and if your machine does this, this is possibly the way to fix it. So if you get away with this, it's on and stopped and you push it right here, push down, see if you can push down. Literally that's it. So the lid opens and closes but you got to push down right here and it starts working again. It's because of the way the switch is. So I come to figure out that the problem actually is that these screws are loose. Okay, so you tighten these two screws up here and then it tightens up the switch. So that way it starts to function properly. So when tighten the screws up and then it should actually operate when the lid opens and closes. Nice and nice and tight. Alright, so that's the problem fixed.
