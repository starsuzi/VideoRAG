 Working with conversions. In this video we're going to be converting milliliters as well as teaspoons. We're going to begin with an example that's going to convert two teaspoons into milliliters. Here's our conversion factor. But for this demonstration we're going to use an approximation that has teaspoons equal to five milliliters. We begin with two teaspoons. We enter our conversion factor. And to convert you remember we're going to multiply our divide by one label to change another one. We have our conversion which equals one. We've made it to a ratio and we're going to multiply that into the two teaspoons. Notice what we're converting to is on top, the milliliters. We insert one label to cancel another label. Here we go the teaspoons cancel out. Now what we do now is we've got the teaspoons out of the way. We multiply. Two times five milliliters equals ten milliliters. That's our solution. So two teaspoons equals ten milliliters. Now let's convert milliliters to teaspoons. We're going to convert ten milliliters into teaspoons. We begin with the ten milliliters. We have our conversion factor here. We turn it into a ratio. The teaspoon divided by five milliliters equals one. And we're going to multiply that into the ten milliliters. Notice that the teaspoons what we're converting to is on top. The milliliters are going to cancel out like so. Now what we're going to do is we're going to multiply. Now we have ten teaspoons divided by five. We're going to clean that up. So two teaspoons which is our solution. So two teaspoons equals ten milliliters. That's the end of the video. Thanks.
