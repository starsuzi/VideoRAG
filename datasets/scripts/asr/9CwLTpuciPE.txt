 Summer time is here and it's time for cold drinks. But sugar crystals don't dissolve easily in any cold beverage. To remedy that problem, you can make liquid sugar at home. Start with equal parts of sugar and water. Today I'll be using one cup of water and one cup of sugar pour the water into a saucepan and then add the sugar. Start with a cold saucepan. You don't want to start with a heat too high. After you put in your ingredients, set the stove to medium high and then start stirring. This whole process, if you use an amount this small, will take you three to five minutes. Keep stirring the mixture. It starts out cloudy, but as the water continues to heat and as you continue to stir, the solution will become more and more clear. Ultimately, it becomes as clear as water as far as I can see. And you don't want this to come to a boil. If it starts to get too hot, cool it down a little bit and keep stirring. And then when the water is clear, remove the pan from the stove. After it cools, you can simply bottle it in any convenient container. I'm being careful because I'm filming this. But I always store my liquid sugar or sugar syrup in a squeeze bottle which I bought at Walmart. And there you go. That's liquid sugar or sugar syrup from muffin to coffee roosters. You'll find us at the Raleigh Flea Market.
