 All right, on the line. Now that I have that wall in, we'll lay in our horizontal steel. Since the wall is finished, this is the highest we're going to have. We're going to go on and drop the vertical bars. Starting right here at the end. Walls finished, we're going to take this concave jointer and we're going to join this wall up. We'll do all our verticals first. That's the up and down. Then we'll go across the horizontals. We're all cleaned up. I hope you learned something here today. I think you have. At least you know how to lay block and set the steel is important. And joining, keeping everything nice and clean. I'm Steve Kelly. See you next time.
