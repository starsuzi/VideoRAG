 Hi guys, I love the look of mercury glass, but it can be a little pricey and hard to find. So today I'm going to show you how you can create the exact same look right at home and transform any old glass container into a piece of super sheet room decor. All you'll need to get started is looking glass or mirrored spray paint, a spray bottle filled with water and an empty glass container. I'm going to be using this old square base. I've had it laying around forever and it's super boring, which makes it perfect for this project. And the first thing we're going to do is spray paint the inside gold. Spray it in short bursts until you have a patchy look. And don't worry if it's not perfect. The beauty of mercury glasses that has a tarnished aged look. Next we're going to take our water bottle and you want to use one that sprays in a mist, not a stream, and give the outside a light coat. This is going to create the texture or splatter effect you see in mercury glass. And finally we're going to use our looking glass or mirrored spray paint and give the outside a nice light coat. And then blot it with a paper towel if you wanted to look even more distressed. You can also go back and do this with sand paper once it's dry. And tada! You have a beautiful mercury glass vase for a fraction of the cost and I promise no one will be able to tell the difference. You can literally use anything from baby food to mason jars. This is such an easy way to upcycle an old piece of glass you might not be using and create a beautiful new accent for your home. And I think they look especially beautiful with a candle glowing inside. Alright guys, I think this mercury glass turned out so pretty. I hope you'll give it a try. Tell me in the comments below what other DIYs you'd like to see this holiday season. And we'll see you next Friday. Bye guys! Bye! See you bye bye! Uh oh!
