 This is an 18-speed transmission. Generally, the 18-speed has more gears than you'll ever even need to use unless perhaps you're pulling trains in the mountains or heavy weight. But basically, it's just an H-pattern shift with a splitter. So, I'll get us going here and we'll do the H-pattern until see how it works. This is a CAD motor and CADs, like to shift at lower P.O. And if you shift it properly at the proper RPM, you can see it takes virtually no effort at all. So, there's four. Now, I split it and here's the start of the H-pattern again. So, there's the second H-pattern one on top the other and then to get into the top gear now, I just split it again. And we're in the top gear. There are all sorts of gears in between, because as I say, unless you're pulling heavy weight, you're in the mountains. You really don't need to do that. I just like to use the overdrive gears when I get out into the top. Shifting well is kind of like riding a bike. The more you do it, the better you get at it. You can have two trucks, identically, specced and they'll shift differently. So, every truck shifts a little differently. Each has its own personality. Just take the time, spend the time to get to know what your truck likes. Where the sweet spots are. Take your time. Shift slowly, feather the clutch and feather the fuel to help slide it in. Never try to force a gear. You don't need to force the gear. They'll slide in themselves, literally. If you have everything lined up correctly, the speed and the RPM and the shifter. But relax. It's not something to be rushed. Just relax and practice. It's as simple as that.
