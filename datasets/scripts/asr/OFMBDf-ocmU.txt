I Penciled in my brows added some mascara and then just topped off this look with a very bright pink lip color And I don't know how many of you guys know this about me But I do work as a princess for birthday parties and events and such and this is the typical color that I use for my princess parties So I thought it was appropriate for Rapunzel and that's it I think my hair and makeup came together so well And they really add to the whole Rapunzel look and go really well with the costume I say your face so for the costume this DIY is actually really really cheap and simple for the top I'm just imitating the corseted look of Rapunzel's dress with a purple crop top and some pink ribbon I just strung the ribbon along the shirt in that criss-cross pattern and then secured it with some hot glue I decided to cut the bottom off of my shirt so that it would be a little bit more of a crop top But that's totally optional You could cut it shorter if you want or you could leave it long and tuck it in I think both ways are super cute. It's just totally up to you The skirt is just this light purple pleated skirt from the forever 21 basic section and it was literally $4 so I was super stoked about that Then I just took the same pink flowers from my hair and glued them to the top of the skirt I love this because it makes the whole outfit a little bit more matchy and the flowers are just very purple I'll stretch maybe sketch deep and climb the cord dress I'll be re-bought books if I have time to spare And of course for my last costume thing I had to dress little bruiser up like Pascal because Duh this is like the epitome of couples costumes right?
