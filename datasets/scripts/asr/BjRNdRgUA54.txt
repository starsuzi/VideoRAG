 Hey everybody welcome to part two on how to cure a pork loin Canadian bacon style. That's the pork loin from part one. We just put it in our fridge and boom two weeks later there's a cured pork loin. Actually I had an extra one that was already ready to go and so that's what we're using for part two. But depending on the diameter of your pork loin will obviously determine how long you cure it. Usually it's between 14 to 21 days. And here's what we want to do. I want to do something a little different for this particular cure and drawing. I want to look how gorgeous that looks. I want to do a test between regular dry aging in the in the drying chamber and drying with aspergillus or riser or cogey that has been inoculated on the outside of it. So one of these pork loins is just going to be wrapped and hung to dry with a little bit of penicillium now. G events is to protect it from the elements and the other one is going to have cogey rice sprinkled all over it with cogey spores and and we're going to incubate that in an incubation chamber for roughly 48 to 60 hours. And so what I'm doing now is I'm preparing the rice and all we're doing is we're adding some cogey spores to the rice and this is going to be kind of like the mix that I pull from. So that'll that'll be that's way more than I need for this project. But I'm going to make some cogey rice later and I'll use that up. And so all I'm going to do is I'm going to take some some really finely ground rice flour and I'm going to coat the entire pork loin and what this is going to do is this is going to give food to the cogey. And so right now I'm just sprinkling the cogey with the rice flour that's been in that mix here a minute ago. So I've got rice flour first and then cogey with rice flour next and I coat the whole thing. And just like the other piece of loin I want to weigh this because I want to get a green weight basically my starting weight because I need to know how much weight we're going to lose. And so I'm starting at 8.79 my target is 571 I want to lose about 35% and so instead of going into the drying chamber we're going to put it into an incubation chamber and all I'm doing is I'm just going to elevate it a little bit with some water and I'm using a cheesecake mold but that's only just to you know raise the raise that cling film up just a little bit higher and I want to make sure I give my edges a little bit of space so that some air can circulate through and that's it it's pretty simple I want to maintain high humidity I want to maintain about 90 degrees temperature because it's a really lean cut if it was a fat of your cut I'd probably try to incubate it about 80 maybe or 79 but this is what it's going to look like I've got some thermometers in there and that's just to give me the ambient reading of the temperature within the chamber and so I'm able to monitor that from from in my house and here's the other pork loin so I actually had some collagen sheets that I've been wanting to use up that I actually forgot I had and when I was going through my casings I realized I had a couple options I had some casings ever way too big I had some cheesecloth or had these really cool collagen sheets that I've never used before so this is me using those for the very first time and basically you just wrap it around and as the moisture escapes the protein then that collagen sort of sticks sticks to it and so we'll see what happens it was actually really easy to work with this is mold 600 I've mixed it with a little bit of water and pinacillium now G events as that's all it is actually I'll let it bloom for a little while and so it left it on the counter for about six or eight hours and now I'm just brushing the entire the entire muscle just like that and so at this point we're gonna sanitize the torch and get that thing I've got a couple little air pockets I want to get out of it and we want to make sure that there's no unwanted bacteria being introduced to this piece of meat as it smells amazing it looks absolutely gorgeous I cannot wait and welcome to the chamber so as you can see my chamber has not been in use we are we are putting some stuff back into it and this is the first go matter of fact if you're watching this video and your industry or couldery and you've always been curious on how to make a certain thing leave it in the comments section below and I'll make a video on how to make it as you can see my chamber is wide open and I'll probably make some jenoa here coming up I'll make some copas coming up all right so let me tell you what I've got going on this is a a thermostat and I've got it said at 86 degrees Fahrenheit and I've got some preset variables so when it goes below 86 then my smoker which is plugged in right here kicks on and it brings the temperature up to where I want it this is the high-grace stat which controls the humidity and basically all I have is an 88% value so I want my humidity at 88% and anytime it drops below whatever value I said it at then my humidifier kicks on and this is after about 36 hours as you can see the humidifier immediately kicks on it actually looks really cool and starts to put a lot of humidity into this box and I've got an actual update for what I ended up having to do later on but I'll post a different video for that which turned that chamber into something really really great but as you can see 36 hours into it the mold is really starting to grow I didn't like the water aspect at the bottom and so I removed that and now we're basically 60 hours so the next day I'm gonna go ahead and remove it there's an interesting life cycle when it comes to Koji and as you can see that you see the yellow spots on the on the mold itself and so what happens is after about 48 hours Koji's gonna want to continue its life cycle and if you leave it in there for much longer 60 plus 72 hours then it's gonna want to it's gonna want to go to Paul and that's what it's doing right now and so it's at its very first stage of telling me hey it's about time for me to go to the next step and so I'll probably left it in there for a little bit longer than I should have and as you could see the type of grating that I had it on caused the the spores to sort of lock itself in but no big deal I was able to pull them off of the grating and I'm just gonna kind of puzzle piece this thing back together and see if if we can just go ahead and finish up this process so using this collagen sheet we're gonna do the same exact thing I've already weighed it and we're gonna go ahead and tie it up so I'm gonna trust this up and hang it next to the other port going and now one has Penicillin Naljuvences this one has Koji or Aspergillus Arise and we're gonna see the difference so Mark your calendars episode three or part three to this is gonna be kind of the conclusion if you're new to this channel consider subscribing today's video was about charcuterie but tomorrow's video well I guess you'll just have to wait and see we thank you for sticking around if you've made it to the end give it a great big thumbs up if you like this video and if you got any suggestions give me a comment in the comment section below I'd love to hear from you guys I read every comment and I reply to every one of them so look forward to seeing you in the next video and I'll talk to you soon
