 The KitchenAid stand mixer meat grinder attachment is an easy way to grind your own chicken, beef or turkey in your own home. This way you can choose your favorite cuts of meat, it's fat content, and whether you want a coarse or a fine grain depending on what you're making such as chili, meatloaf or a burger. Today I'd like to make a really tender GC burger using this chuck. I'm gonna start by putting together my meat grinder. I've got the body of it right here. I'm gonna add the grind worm right inside, the knife on top. I'm gonna use the fine plate. It fits right there on the notches. Screw on the ring. Now I'm gonna put the body into the mixer in the attachment hub. It slides easily in. Make sure to screw it in tightly. I've cut my beef chuck into rough cubes and I'm just gonna add that into the top of my body just a few chunks at a time. I'm gonna put a clean bowl underneath the grinder to catch the meat and using this pusher to help push down the meat I'm gonna turn on my kitchen aid. You don't need to have it a very high speed. Maybe number two or number four at the most. You can see the ground meat starting to come out. I'm gonna add more chunks as needed and continue to push down. Clean up of your meat grinder attachment is also so simple. Every part of the body except for the metal pieces is dishwasher safe. Grinding your own meat at home lets you know exactly what you're eating to ensure the freshest and the most delicious meat.
