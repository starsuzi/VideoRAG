 What's up guys, welcome to our kitchen and it's 8.45 at night so what better thing to do than to cook as you can pop high. Now if I was to do this in the oven it would be way past my bedtime because you know it takes like 40-50 minutes but you know what I'm going to do this in the air fryer and I've seen a lot of people say online can you cook frozen hot pies in the air fryer and the answer yes you can and it only takes about 20 minutes. Alright so this is your standard Marie counter chicken pot pie comes in the multi-pack of four if you're going to be using those bigger single ones I've tracked maybe four or five minutes onto this because they are bigger and bigger and take a little bit of cooking. Alright let's throw this in. So 21 minutes just to give it a minute to warm up and also we're going to leave it at 370 and away we go. Got a few frozen tando tops left over it as well so we're going to throw those in with about 12 minutes remaining. Alright we're done let's take a look. Alright guys here we are 21 minutes later perfect with golden brown chicken pot pie. And ten of tops. Alright let's start it with the fork and see how hot it is isn't it? Definitely cooked all the way through. I'm adding burning hot in there perfect just absolutely perfect. So that's it guys 21 minutes 370 in the air fryer perfect pot pies every single time.
