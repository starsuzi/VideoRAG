 I Said like inside your eyes you make me feel like I'm a wait Hi guys, so welcome back to my channel. So it's been a while since I did my last video So I thought for myself We need to do our unboxing so I really wanted to get a new backpack This like I've been seeing like this small backpack like Stella McCartney Mochino and Yeah, so I came across like MCM backpacks. They're like famous for their backpacks But I don't like big bags most of my bags are small so I saw this mini X-mini Bebe Boo bebe boo back pack and I really wanted it in black Because it looked like so good. I saw that they have it like in metallic in pink in beige So I went to the MCM store here and they didn't have it in black they just had like the more exclusive ones with like Like with glass diamonds on and stuff like that, but I wanted the normal one Yeah, the standard one with the studs on the side So ordered it from Nima the Marcus. I found that there and Yeah, so Guys, I already opened it since someone here at home made me do it But it came in this box like this and It was wrapped like you know Like this and this plastic bag it came with the dust bag And the dust bag Is this one of course, but it was like a bit you know, it was this wrinkly and What I didn't like since the people who know me know I'm picky Like like what the What is that is that like chocolate or foundation or something like Nima and Marcus come on now when you're shipping stuff to other countries like hello It says we pay so much we pay the back fee and And like taxes and everything you know the shipping charges and everything so I don't know and Here was the receipt that was in one of the pockets I didn't get any care card nothing it didn't come with nothing I don't know if they just have lost it or if I don't know if they just threw it away or something that was weird, but I got the Nima and Marcus receipt This bag costs $670 but for me it was plus shipping and taxes and everything when you you know convert There is the beauty Here's the beauty Okay, so this is the bag look how gorgeous it is it's so beautiful the receipt was inside this pocket and As you guys see the straps I've made them super short the only thing you can do is Because I tried like different ways and I tried to like find YouTube videos on or just Google at how to make the straps shorter because I know most of the people who wear this backpack where it pretty low down so you have to remove the smaller pieces From the straps And just use the longer pieces So then you can wear it like a tighter Backpack if you don't want it if you don't want it like to hang on your butt So yeah like this How cute And this is the inside So it comes like with brown leather you will have the MCM tag here and you will have your serial number here I didn't remove the my plastic thing on this one and you will have like two small pockets inside It will only fit like cards and coins and Yeah, and inside you will fit a lot I think no, I never packed my bags a lot It doesn't matter if I have a big bag or a small bag. I only like just packing like my wallet or Yeah coin purse Phone a lip balm or something so And I just added this keychain I think I'm gonna change it up later to something else, but for now this is fine. I think So I hope you like this unboxing and don't forget to give it a thumbs up and Subscribe to my channel so you can see more of my videos and Push the bell button so you can get notified every time I post and I will see you guys next time
