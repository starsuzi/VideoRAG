 Looking for a do-it-yourself little tip? How about taking the old paragines, and turning it into a tube top? All you need is the paragines and a pair of scissors. First of all, lay your jeans flat on a table in front of you. Second step. Fold them over. And now you're ready to cut. Now just keep in mind that you want to cut above where the inseam connects. With beaux-cheeks, such a big trend, why not do it yourself? You can take one of your old pieces, and now recreate one of the coolest looks in all the magazines, and what all the slurries are wearing. And now you can disregard those, and you have your tube top. As you can see, it's going to be a loose fit on the front a little flowy. But when you turn to the back, as a really cool, relaxed, fit, covering more of your back. When you turn around, there you go, a little surprise. There you have it, a super easy way to upgrade those old paragines. Do it yourself and make a tube top, and achieve desert chic style and instant.
