 Hey it's Jeff the Matesman. Oh crap. Remy said, there are sinks not joining Jeff. Well, I unplugged it and then I was like, my swell show video how I unplugged it. So I filled it back up with some water after I unplugged it and put the stopper in arches. I didn't want to water it going anywhere. So, anyone, so you have double compartments sink like this. Let's say your water is not going down. You can get these glasses that Walmart, most people have these. I've seen these in a lot of people's houses and stuff. They're really cheap just little liquor glasses or whatever you want to call them. Take the glass. Plug this right? This is draining but stick the glass in there. Hold this with this hand. Let's punch it. Let that out. I'm going to do it for this side. Put the plunger on this side. This one. Let the water go up a bit. These glasses fit perfect in the sink like this. You have a suction. Yes, good suction. There she goes. A glass band plunger. You have a plunger and you're washing your plunger. So, it's made with a man tip for you. Jeff, the mate's man. Have a good day guys.
