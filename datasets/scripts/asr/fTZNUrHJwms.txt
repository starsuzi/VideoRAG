 Gonna be cooking up some spicy lamb chops today. Now what we're gonna do is make up a really nice simple marinade Absolutely delicious though and we're gonna put the lamb chops in the marinade leave them for about an hour Once they've been marinated You can then put them on the barbecue or under the grill certain bit of rice Absolutely delicious. Now the first thing I want to do is just quick you run your fruit the ingredients we're gonna use Now I've got my lamb chops there and we've actually got 900 grams which is roughly about two pounds in weight Now with the lamb chops what you want to do is rinse them under cold water and then dry them off a little bit of tissue Try and get them as dry as possible The idea of getting them dries that it helps the marinade to stick to the meat So try and dry them off as much as you can now to make this really simple marinade What we're gonna use as a base is natural yoghurt So it's like unsweetened yoghurt now this whole pot is 500 grams I'm gonna use half a pot so roughly 250 grams Then we've got a couple of dried bay leaves so add those in give a really nice flavor Garlic cloves now I've got two really good sized garlic cloves here If you've got the smaller ones like I normally have then you probably want to use about four Peel them and if you can crash them down, you know in your petal mortar ideal make them as sort of crushed up as possible Now with the ginger I've got a fresh piece of ginger there peel that and again You might want to sort of grate it and just try and get it as fine as possible It's just about you know spreading all those sort of lovely flavors in the marinade Now I've got a green chili there cut it in half and take all the seeds out and chop it up nice and fine Then we've got a mixture of sort of Indian spices So I just go through those now just to quickly go through the spices now I use teaspoon as the measurement now I actually use one teaspoon of chili powder one teaspoon of gallam masala two teaspoons of ground coriander and two teaspoons of ground cumin and just about half a teaspoon of salt So there you go There's just sort of spice mix the marinade and what we need to do is just put those even all into a bowl mix them up Put the lamb in there and just let them marinate for at least an hour So what I'm next going to do is just move the lamb chops out the way and make up this lovely marinade now to make this marinade First thing is let's get the yoghurt in there now. So I'm going to use about 250 grams So it's about half this pot. It's only roughly just make sure there's enough to sort of cover the lamb really then We can just pick all these spices up Just pop them in a couple of bay leaves Next to going to be the garlic the ginger and a chili now with the garlic cloves I'm actually going to sort of peel those and sort of crushing down nice and fine the ginger I'm going to peel that and then I'm probably going to grate it It's probably an easy way again in there with the chilies slice them down the middle take all the seeds out chop it Now nice and fine and we just add it all into the mix. So I just can't get those ready So I've crushed me garlics and again with the ginger I've sort of grated that and fairly finely chopped the chilies. So we're just going to put that into the mixture Just put it all in give it a stir up and then we can just add in those lovely lamb chops So let's give it a stir up. That thing is even when you stir it up and you've got the lamb chops in there If you think oh it needs a little bit more of the yoghurt, you know, you can always add a little bit in So we see how we get home with what we've got here It's done. They look nice and really once you've got it mixed up We just put the lamb chops in there now. I've got my lamb chops there and remember try and make sure nice and dry Now I'm just going to put the whole lot in the bowl there You can use a fork, but I'm actually going to use me hands Just trying to get everything nicely rubbed with all that marinade It's going to rinse me hands and then we're going to put a little bit of cellophane over there It's going to put a little bit of cellophane over there and Marinate that leave it marinating in the fridge for about an hour So if I've had me lamb chops marinating It's just about one hour really so that's just done right back. Oh, it smells beautiful Look at that. Looks great. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take those out Put them on a baking tray get them under the grill and cook them up Now in the baking tray, I'm just going to put a little bit of oil Not very much wipe that round with this issue Now with the lamb chops, I'm just going to lay them out One by one until I've done the whole lot so now I've got all the lamb chops laid out on the baking tray Make sure you get all that marinade out now We're going to cook those roughly for about 10 minutes Now remember these lamb chops are not particularly thick if you've got really nice thick ones You need to cook them for a little bit longer So I've been cooking the lamb chops for about five minutes So one thing to do is quickly turn them over put them back under the grill and just try and build up a little bit of colour And you know get the lamb cooked how you like it So I finished with cooking the lamb now on the first side we gave it five minutes Then I flipped it over and on the other side I actually cooked it for seven minutes So in total it's been cooking for 12 minutes I just gave it an extra couple of minutes because I just want to build up a little bit of colour So let's just take it out put it on the table and serve it out Now I've got some rice with some peas I think I just put that All the way along in the middle I'll put the lamb chops all round the edge of it So I'm just going to put those Oh, all the way around Beautiful Oh, it looks so nice Hope they're going to taste good as well So I'm just going to carry on Putting those all round the edge Look at that They are smelling and looking delicious I'm sure they're going to taste good So Just pop them around Look at that Beautiful Now what are these juices? The juices are probably so delicious Just going to pour A little bit A little bit of gas in the rice It's probably a good thing All the way around Oh, look at that Beautiful Now it's going to finish it off Got a little bit of coriander Fresh coriander Kind of chopped So let's just put that all around Oh, that's beautiful Now I'm just going to try a little bit of that This one's kind of near So this is try it up It's kind of open It's nice and soft It's fairly well done Obviously if you want it a little bit pinky in the middle You can always just cook it for You know, two or three minutes less But let me try that I'm lovely Spicy but not Not too overpowering Now we just try a little bit more now Oh Definitely got a sort of Indian flavor All those spices Try a little bit of that rice So look It's lovely In fact, that bit I'm trying to pick it up in my hand actually Really get the juices out Oh yeah Got some nice flavors Really nice I think you probably could add a little bit extra spice Maybe A little bit more chili powder Or an extra chili if you like it A little bit hot of it Mmm Lovely I really enjoy it I think your whole family really enjoys one Thanks for watching I hope you enjoy The original naked chef Delicious
