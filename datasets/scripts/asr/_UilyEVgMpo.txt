 Almost all honey are floating when harvested, but at least all Swedish honey will crystallize by itself. And if you leave it to itself, the crystals will be big and crunched between the teeth. Some people think that it's sugar added, but it's just the natural crystals from the honey. While you put the honey in jars, you have to check the moisture level. It has to be below 20% otherwise the honey might start to geese. In olden days, when you wanted a smooth and crystallized honey, you had to stir all the honey at least two times a day for several weeks, depending on the kind of nectar the bees has had gathered honey from. That was really hard work, so I have a much easier method that I use that gets it already in just three days. To crystallize the honey, you take one kilo of the newly harvested honey and mix it with a 100 grams of already crystallized honey from last year's harvest. Stir it vigorously for a minute, morning and afternoon for three days and keep it in the refrigerator in the meantime. After a few days, the honey will turn white with a lot of really small crystals that will have to crystallize the rest of the honey. You mix it with the rest of the honey preferably with just a small portion, maybe half of it, and then you mix the crystals with the rest of the honey. When you mix the honey with the crystals, you can pour it directly into jars. If you keep them refrigerated for a few weeks, the honey will be smooth and crystallized in the jars without any big crystals. This is what I think is the best way to get a smooth and creamy honey without the aggravation of first-oring all the honey at the same time.
