 Okay, we start by laying it out as a diamond and roll each side to the center. One at a time. Of course, if you want a smoother finished product, you'd iron the folds out of your napkin first. It doesn't have to be too tight of a fold on a roll just in the best you can, because it's going to loosen up when you tie it. Both sides now are a roll to the center. And then we fold it in half with the rolls out. Tie a loose slip knot. Pull only a little bit of the ends through. And you can tuck these ends back, tuck in the points. And then you roll the sides and bring them up. And that makes your outer rows leave. And I tuck these ends back in the same way. And then you can tie them up. And that makes your outer rows leave. And I tuck these ends back in. And then you spend a little time and just organize it so it looks the way you want. And you pinch here to hold it. There you can pinch it with something or you can put a little piece of tape there to fold your rows back. That's it.
