 What is a spring-foreign pan all about? They can be kind of intimidating. They can, but they're very easy to use. Normally it's a two-piece pan and it has the bottom and then it has like a ring around it that's two to three inches high. You can find some taller than that. So what you're going to do is bake like your flourless chocolate cake or your cheese cake. She's taking it. She's taking it. She's taking it. She's taking it. And if you're going to pack your ice cream cake or you know like a no baked cheesecake, you want to go ahead and put it in there, let it chill. If you baked it, you want to make sure it's cool. And then when you get ready to serve it, you're just going to pull this latch and lift it up over your cheesecake. So you serve on this. And you can slice it on that too. Very nice. Now what about like a cake mix or something like that? Cake mix is usually too thin of a batter to use. So you want something much, much thicker. So a spring-form pan is really geared toward a cheesecake or a very thick like flourless chocolate cake. Okay. Next on As Nancy, Addable Flowers.
