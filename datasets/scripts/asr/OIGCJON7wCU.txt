 Okay this is my first attempt at making me on DIY wind chan. It's made from just bits and bubs. Spare steel, I had one inch thick tube square and I'll diamond this stone cutting wheel. It's only in the experimental stage yet I need to put some wire at the top because that's the hell by string. But the tuned the tuned to an A pentatonic base scale and they sound absolutely brilliant. Let me just give you a quick go so you can hear them. So there you go. And at least we come it's time what you think. Good luck.
