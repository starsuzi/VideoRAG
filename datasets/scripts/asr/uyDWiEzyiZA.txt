 Everyone thanks for tuning in today. It was one of the dreams. We've mentioned the things to be aware of in the heat and today it's the official hottest day of the year this year 116 for the high so I'm outside with some chocolate chip cookie dough on a cookie sheet and my car and I've told you guys that it gets hot and you gotta be aware of this for your kids and for your pets and all that good stuff so what we're gonna try to do is I put this guy in here right up on this dash sitting in the sun and we're gonna see if we can bake some cookies normally cookies take about 15 minutes that's at 350 they say it's 20 to 30 degrees hotter in a car so I'm gonna guess that this will take at least an hour we'll see you then and the current temperature now is 114 as I said today we tied the record for this day of 116 and it's also the hottest day this year that's far and you can see that they've flattened out just like a cookie would in the oven and I expect that we'll let it go until the sun's about to go down we started this kind of late so we're not even in the peak of the heat and they're baking along just fine inside the car we'll check back it probably right before sundown maybe a little before it's now been about two hours plus or minus and we've got varying reports on temperatures as high as 116 while we've started this and as low as 113 so between 113 and 116 you can see that they have definitely cooked down they're still actually they're real close to being done so I would imagine if we had started this an hour earlier these would be baked just like you came out of the oven we'll take them inside to see what happens it's we're inside now because frankly it's hot outside so brought them in and I just wanted to show you again this was a two-hour cook and they're actually pretty much fine like I said if I did let them sit out there for the full time they're still doughy but they're they're cooked and imagine what that would be for a kid or a pet this is the risk 116 degrees you get the idea again you bake cookie just to show you it is real it's doughy but it's good subscribe share like comments down below check back for the next video when you subscribe ring the bell since you get the alerts otherwise take care
