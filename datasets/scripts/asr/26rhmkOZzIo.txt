 Drink we're gonna make now is called an amaretto stone sour. It's a great anytime cocktail. You could either reserve straight up or under rocks. I'm old school so I'm gonna serve it straight up. And the ingredients are amaretto sweet almond flavored liquor. There we can see it right there. We're gonna use orange juice and we're gonna use some of our sweet and sour bar mix which is reconstituted citrus juices usually lemon lime with sugar added. Nine alcoholic. So since I'm going to be serving it straight up I have to pre-chill it so I'm gonna use my mixing cup. Place ice in it and then we're gonna put, oops, heavy bottle. One ounce of our amaretto in it. There we go. One ounce of our sweet and sour. And one ounce of our orange juice. Right there. Right okay. There we go. Got all our ingredients in there. So let's shake up our drink. Get it nice and cold. Strain it into our stem cocktail glass. Right like so. And then we're gonna make it look pretty. It's a sweet drink. So we're gonna put a nice piece of maraschino cherry which is a sweet and cherry. Right like so. And there we have it. Amaretto sour. Don't forget to subscribe. You
