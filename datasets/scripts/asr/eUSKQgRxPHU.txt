 Hi guys this is Luffy from BetterByTheBite.com and today I'm going to show you how to make a deco mesh wreath or at least start it off. So here we go. So in order to make one of these wreaths you need a few things, you need a wreath frame, you need some pipe cleaner, just regular old pipe cleaner, but you do need to cut it in half and then you also need two types of deco mesh. So you need a 21-inch roll and that will be your main color, whatever the larger roll is and then an accent color, which is your 5-1-half inch roll. So the first thing you want to do, after you've cut all your pipe cleaners in half you need to wrap it them around the wreath frame. So first thing you have these crossbars, okay, just like that. You're going to take your pipe cleaner and around two inner rings, that's what you're going to die of, really wrap this pipe cleaner around, okay, you're going to go to your next bar, same thing, two inner rings, diagonally so it's straggling the crossbar, you're going to wrap it around just like so. You're then, once you do that, around the circumference of the wreath, you are going to put a pipe cleaner in this space between the crossbars. So see the two outer rings, you take your pipe cleaner, again, secure this. This one you want to make sure it's tighter because there can be some wiggle room. So you do that around your frame and now it is time to actually start putting the deco mesh in place. So you grab your big deco mesh or 21 inches, you just want to bunch up one end and then locate a crossbar, it doesn't matter and that will be your starting and ending point. So secure it with your pipe cleaner. So from here, you just want to make a poof with it, grab, I don't know about nine inches or so, you're going to secure it in each crossbar. So you make your poof like I just did and secure it with the pipe cleaner at the crossbar. So make your poof, go ahead and tie it. So now aren't you glad you went ahead and you put all your pipe cleaners at the crossbars and makes it a lot easier so you have free hands. Okay, so you are going to do that around the entire wreath frame. After you do that, it's time to fill it in. So remember those extra middle ties that we tied at the outer rings. Once you get back to your starting point, which would be right here. So imagine this is been taken out, rolled all the way around. You're then going to take it back without cutting it, you're going to fill it in at each outer ring. Same thing you did, the poof method, secure it and this is still with that brown. Okay, once you do that, it's time for your accent color. So my wreath was fallen spired, so I did brown in orange. So start with this, you just find again a crossbar. Now you're just basically tying this on top of the brown that's already down. But this time you're going to do a zigzag method. So you'll start your accent color at a crossbar. You didn't go to an outer ring, okay? Now normally there would be brown here because remember I said we're going to fill in the outer rings with brown once you're done to give it a reasonable full. Yes, I guess. So you did crossbar, outer ring, then you come back to the crossbar. So like I said, it's just this weaving in and out motion. That you do. At first when you start, it might look a bit threadbare as I say, you can see gaps. But as you continue to fill in your wreath, it'll look better and better. Once you do that, yours hopefully will look like this. So I'll show you what I mean. So this wreath right here, this is my project that I did the other day. So as you can see, there's more fullness than what I was showing you. And really you can use any accent that you want. I chose some pumpkins and some leaves to give it a little bit of that fall flavor along with a twine lighter and v for our last name to top it off. So I hope this helps and good luck and have fun. They can be your own deck of the streets. Good night.
