 So we're going to show you how to do some cons. Jim, this is, I've got some cracked already. Three shells. You just pull them apart. That's how easy they come apart. This, something don't crack all the way so you have to really work out it a little bit. But pretty easy. Right there. Well, we're working on that one a little bit like this. Right out of the shell. How do we get that one? Well, this little nifty guy. Take your pecan, put it in the middle. Pecan. Crack them just like that. Sometimes they come out full whole halves like that. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes you get lucky to get them shell like that where you just pull the ends off. Just like that. So that's what I'm doing today. Sitting here, cracking shells. That one I push too hard. I'm going to work on that for a minute. Let's see like this now. This little piece turns so that you're going to adjust them. So you want to stay with all one size pecan. What I didn't know was different pecans. There's different pecans. There's stewards. I don't even know. There's like 20 different sizes of pecans. Pecan. Pins. I'm going to call some pecans I call them pecans. I'm from up north. She's from South. But actually she's from Riverside, California. So I'm not sure which one they are. All I know is they're good. They go good in the morning. They're good cup of coffee. Nice background music. That's what we got. I got to get busy. I got to all of you to crack. And up. Just watch your stuff.
