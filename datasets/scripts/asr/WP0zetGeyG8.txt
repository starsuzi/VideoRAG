Goes into a cup and I'm gonna boil all these all together. I need to have to babysit and milk as we all know. So the sun's milk is simmering. I can see it simmered. I'm gonna add one cup of coffee. And I'm using my fresh blue coffee. The one I'm using drinking every day and welcome to use espresso. But I'm using coffee. It's fine. Yay! And I'm gonna simmer this for another 30 seconds. And I can see it's simmering. And now it's time to add white chocolate chips. So before we add chocolate chips, just remove from the stove or shut off the stove. I just do not want my stove. And I'm adding one cup of chocolate chips. About three four cups to be correct. And I'm gonna leave this on a stove. About from three to five minutes. Just leave it as this. Don't even touch it. Now this is my favorite part. You can use this. So I'm gonna keep this above the wall. One of two minutes, how long does it want? The pan is from my palm tree. And you're gonna need a little bit of this. Here we go. Look how full it is. Love it. So I'm gonna put this into my cup. Or marker favorite mug. And we're gonna have homemade white chocolate mocha. So that's it for today guys. I hope you enjoyed watching my videos. And if you do please thumbs up, subscribe, leave me a comment below what is your favorite fall drink.
