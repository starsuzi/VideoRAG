 The bumper on this camera is cut deep. This is normally beyond the abilities of touch up but it happens to be low on the car and white so we can achieve a functional repair. Cut away the black plastic flaps so we have a flat and level surface to work with. We'll apply Bondo scratch and chip filler into the repair area using a squeegee to fill the scratches. Continue to squeegee the filler into the scratches until they're filled above the surface. With our proprietary chemical paint leveler remove the excess filler material. We'll wrap our shop towel around a foam block to ensure that we don't push our fingers into the scratches and remove the filler. Continue until all excess filler material is removed. Clean the repair area with wax and grease remover. Select a shade of white white too looks like the best match here. The box is organized so you can quickly grab the repair materials that you need for the job. Touch up the scratches with a medium sized brush. Use short overlapping strokes until the scratches are fully colored. Before the repair these cuts definitely stood out. The repair is hard to spot once it's done. We don't recommend touching up most bumper scuffs. This wouldn't work well on a silver or gold scuff but because this is a solid color and it's low on the car we were able to fix this damage without a trip to the body shop. Reassembly of the kit goes quickly and it is ready for its next use.
