 What are we doing? We're doing cupcake. We're going to make. What are we going to make now? Cake. Cake. Chirky cupcake. We're going to attempt to make a turkey. First, we arrange three rows of cupcakes sort of like a rainbow. And then we made this shape with the last six. And this is actually what's going to be our turkey. I use a lot of frosting for this. Two types of white frosting and one of chocolate. We separated the white into three small bowls and then used food coloring to turn them into the colors we wanted. Which were red, orange and yellow. Which were going to be the feathers. Also, I should have used at least two or three more cupcakes but we didn't make enough. We didn't make any extra ones. My camera shut off here but basically what I did was frost the first row. And a frost the first row red. Sorry. And our red came out a little pink actually. So you could try to make it a little bit more red. The second row was orange and the rest of the cupcakes frosted them yellow. Again, my camera kept shutting off but what I was doing here was using the last cupcakes I showed in the beginning the last six to form our turkey. And I smoothed out the frosting with a spatula. Then we finished off his legs, beaks and eyes. And I did this by placing the frosting in a Ziploc bag and cutting off a tip. So this is our turkey. We were kind of on a time limit so it didn't come out greater how expected it to. But if you have more time and have better artistic skills in your turkey, you should look pretty fabulous.
