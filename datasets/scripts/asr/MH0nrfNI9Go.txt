 So we're going to shine a patoski rock and what you're going to need for this is sandpaper starting with 220 grit and then you're going to play with that and then upgrade to 600 800 whatever you think you're going to need to get the job done. This right here is a finished patoski. So you can see the detail in that and then this right here is the unfinished one. And we use a sanding block to assist with the sanding. So my assistant is going to take the sanding block and then take the patoski dip it in water. Make sure it's... You always keep it wet and then you just start sanding. It rolls to get all the white junk off of it. And then you're going to dip it in the water and you're going to keep this process going until you achieve what you think is your finished product. And it should end up very transparent and looking a lot like this right here.
