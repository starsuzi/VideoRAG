 What's up guys it's Jay, Mornin' to have to kill and I'm back here on Borderlands 2 and I finally hit level 61 with my siren. So I figured I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys what build I'm using for my siren because if you've been following through my let's play I told you she could become one of the most offensive characters in the game. So if you take a look at my guns I'm only using level 55 weapons take that into account when you see the footage of what this class can actually do because even if she had level 61 weapons that I wouldn't have to rely on on level 61 B which is absolutely amazing. Look at the capacity on that and the amp damage 146,000 which makes my level 55 guns all the more relevant right now but in the future when I have a level 61 sandhawk and other level 61 weapons I will be moving on to my famous maximum adaptive shield. And this one right here is actually level 59 at level 61 this has a capacity of 200,000 and a max health of 50,000 and 51 to 52 elemental resistance. God damn! So let's go ahead and take a look at the weapons like I said I'm using the sandhawk right now because that's the only thing I have we went through to pirate booty DLC with a few subscribers we had some fun we did pick up a level 61 E-Tech just about five seconds ago we have this night railer I'm gonna be passing this and my muck-a-muck my level 61 muck-a-muck that I found for my zero which has an amazing damage capacity but we're not talking about that because that's not the topic of the commentary what we're talking about right now is my level 61 siren. And uh, conference call, conference call sucks dick it's still sucks dick so like I said I'm still using a level 50 class mod because the class mod of relics seem to not scale up properly in the game right now so if you do have a level 50 legendary siren you're gonna be able to achieve this because it's very easy and if you've been through my dupe in sessions you probably already have this class mod and it is a max stat class mod which is amazing we get a done damage of plus 29% and a cooldown rate of plus 40%. Which is gonna help exactly what I'm trying to do with this class and we picked this up last night if you see my video about the loot you see it right there that is my storm front later on I will add a moxie pistol so I can't regenerate health because this isn't offensive build it is not my nurse class if you want to see my nurse class I will make another video showing you the co-op class that I use to keep people alive and keep them full of health because that's what a siren typically does but now they have made my admirer. My admirer. Mya. Just as fucking strong as Lilith from Borderlands once let's take a look at the skill tree we have the phase lock why because it's all you can pick it's a phase lock so let's go ahead and take a look at the cataclysm tree right here we have 10 of 5 into flicker because of the legendary siren mod is gonna boost all your abilities up here at the top which is absolutely amazing because right here we get a larger magazine size faster reload I actually should have probably put the skill tree. I can't really get a lot of skills from Blake Phoenix into a forest site but sometimes Blake Phoenix when you get surrounded and you start getting kills wrapping up from grenades and from your phase lock it does help out just a little bit so you can go ahead if you want really fast reloads go ahead and just spec one into here and toss another into the magazine size and reloads team with forest site and Helios I have Helios because when you phase lock it's gonna blast into a huge fire explosion and I also have cloud cool because this is a very good thing to do with this. This is elemental so once I spec all the way down to ruin this now slags electrocutes and caroads all nearby enemies but I'm also giving out a corrosive cloud and a fire explosion so it doesn't matter what element they are they're gonna be slags they're gonna be shocked and they are gonna be corroded so that is amazing this right here is probably my favorite tree for an offensive build my mind. I can't even say that right I don't even know what I'm doing this live right now by the way usually I do these type of videos you know separately I do a commentary post commentary but I'm doing it live right now because I wanted to show you some of the things that are going on in my tree. The reason I have one into sweet release is because I actually ended up having a skilled boy left over and this doesn't hurt to have a little bit of health being restored 15% not much but it's enough to keep you dying from what you get some type of elemental effect on you like if you start burning it. And you're about to die this will help you it will help you a little bit so this right here I expected the mind's eye because we can't who can pass up critical hit damage especially when even all I do is put one skill point and I get you know maxed out at five because of a legendary sire mind leaving you if you wanted to you can go ahead and spec over here and other stuff but I really think Emily if you go down yet it does help out a little bit and back drive I'm not going to be may laying with you. I'm with a little bit I'm with a little bit I'm not going to be with may lay with my my my my I'm not going to be may lay with her because she's not will it's Millus Millus Millus Millus Millus was a may lay beast so let's go ahead and take a look at the motion skill tree right here. Take a look I have accelerate because the sandhawk shoots slow so we want to try to get the bulls there just a little bit faster but also because you know the faster you can kill enemies the faster that this build is gonna do you a lot of work so we also went into word word is gonna keep our shield capacity and recharge the lake go up sky mother fucking high so right now my being shield has about a hundred and forty thousand capacity with my and it is at absolutely fucking amazing suspension of course you're going to want to increase the duration of your phase lock because this is always built around the phase lock this whole build so we got converge because like I said it ruins slags and let your kids and burns nearby enemies so as soon as we phase lock this is gonna suck everybody in and it's gonna hit them it's gonna slag them and you don't have to carry a slag with you weapon with you all the time so then quick in of course the 30% cool down rate all top of the legendary siren mod 40% so we have a 70% cool down rate with our phase lock absolutely amazing and this is the kicker right here sub sequence sub sequence is a skill that will allow you once you kill an enemy that was phase lock it will search out another enemy pick them up phase lock you can pretty much get about three to four enemies with one phase lock which can you really clear out a whole area especially the remaining enemies that weren't phase lock are gonna be ruined with slag corrosive and burn damage which is absolutely amazing so that's pretty much it for my level 61 Maya build and I'm gonna call this the purple haze and if you don't know why go Google Jimmy Hendrix purple haze and look at the lyrics and it does exactly what this and so my name is J more than I have to kill make sure you guys read comment subscribe I hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope you found it a little bit of informative give it a thumbs up if you thought so so my name is J want to make sure you guys read comment subscribe I want to thank you guys for watching and I'm gonna see you guys later
