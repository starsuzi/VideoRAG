 I am always searching for frugal solutions for our everyday lives and today we're making one of my favorites. This is homemade fabric softener and the recipe comes from one good thing by gilling. Now you only need three ingredients, water, vinegar and hair conditioner. So here's what you do. Start with a large container and add six cups of water. Then pour in two cups of hair conditioner. And then you're going to mix in about three cups of white vinegar. Now you want to make sure that you stir this up very well. And then all we're going to do is store it in our trusty mason jar. Now all you have to do when you do your laundry is pour this into the fabric softener section of your washer and yes it works for HE washers as well. Or you can soak a rag and just throw it in the dryer. It's that simple and it's half price. Now I have the recipe for you on moneysavingqueen.com and remember you can like moneysavingqueen on Facebook. Follow me on Twitter. Pin it on Pinterest and save on the go with our mobile site.
