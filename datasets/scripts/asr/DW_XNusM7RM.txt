 Hi, I'm Dustin here on behalf of the expert village here at A. Calcers and now I'm going to show you now that I've done the basic surface cleaner I'll show you how to do a little bit chemical clean others two different types of hats lights and darks I'm going to show you the dark lights a little more involved But this dark one here we got this is it's scout Hat cleaner for dark colors What it is it's basically a foam and a cleanser it kind of gets in there And pulls out all that dirt and grime that you couldn't get with your sponge You want to just nice even coat all the way around Again, you want to grab your sponge like this and just nice circular motions And then wipe it over with the nap counterclockwise Crown front to back like I said before And just circular motions with the nap of the hair And we just want to scrub her down much like when you're Cleaning her floor. It's not much different now before you use this spray here make sure you spray on a Piece that is none that you don't see very often because you want to make sure that the felt is not a color fast felt It will if it is you'll rub off large amounts of black on your hands. So keep that in mind
