 Alright, mate. In my efforts to prevent using harmful chemicals for the environment in myself, I'm using very cheap white vinegar. This is about 39p for half a liter. I'm using that for many applications around the house, from cleaning the windows to the scale, taps and kettles. This was a plastic, it works for a metal one. So what I did for convenience I pour the vinegar into a recycled spray and evoil a vaporizateur. So I just had a cup of tea, empty a cup of tea, also a cup of warm, and then I spray or pour the white vinegar just to cover the metal bits. And if it was a metal kettle, probably one inch or two and a half centimeters, two centimeters of white vinegar would do. Then I leave it until the scale become loose. You rinse it four or five times until you stop smelling the white vinegar and you're ready to go without worrying about any harm or anything. When vinegar is great, the only downside is if you use it to kill beer, it works, but it stinks, like cat poo. So it's not the test of everyone. The other thing I can do, you see how these yellow marks left by the tea. If you spray just a little bit of white vinegar, you don't need to scrub. You just wipe it and it's clean as a whistle, sum up or subscribe. Thanks for watching.
