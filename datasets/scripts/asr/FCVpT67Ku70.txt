 Hey y'all, it's Boss Made in. Well, I'm gonna show y'all how to make Senty, hopefully this way I make it. So, I got these two big old Mason drawers from Hobby Lobby. I think they're seven something. Seven, nine, nine, I think if you get them when they're on sale, maybe the half off sale, you can get them cheaper. I use a big towel. See how it's got heavy. It's eight cups. This is probably four pints. Two, three, four pints. Hi guys. Hi. I got a ticket for a party. I know. Well, I feel too. I want a ticket for a birthday party. I use five looking T-Max as each container. I'm in there. Nice. You can still stick in the drawer. I'll leave this much. I'll leave this much space. So, when you put sugar in there, or honey, it fills up. When you do that. You know, you get culprue. The T, this way too, and you're in your refrigerator. You just put the coffee in there. I have to put your refrigerator and culprue. But, you want sugar in it. You can't put sugar in your cold, because it won't melt. How much do you spend? I think that's something that might be the splendor for those other sweet tea drinkers. Excuse me. We're going to the backyard. There's some of the pool that's kind of found gas sunny. But, I'll leave. You can tell. They have a cloud. I have to tee. Out in the sun, mine. On me. You can see. You can't lift it. You can start with the brew. So, come back in about an hour and check it. So, he's already... Yeah, the tea is already brewing, but still. So, I'm going to come back an hour and check it. I usually let mine sit for two hours. Some people say let's sit for four to five hours. So... Well, spend an hour. So... There's the tea. I'm going to give it a few more minutes. And then come back about 30 minutes and check on it again. Since it's been pretty sunny. And I'm going to bring it inside and show you how I make it with the sugar. If you like this video, give us a big thumbs up.

Well, it's been almost two hours. I'm going to bring it in. Alright, guys, we kind of want to open them. And I even need some to seal the coffee. I'll pop the seal. Take this out. And the tea guys. And then try to raise the red setilla. Then, I'm going to have to cut the sugar and add it to it. I'm going to try to raise it a little bit. And we'll take it. We have it. Let that cool. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.
