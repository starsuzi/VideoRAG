 Alright yo, well I had a roof on it, which you see right here. And it's a 24 by 14 roof and I just want to show y'all a tip. I had put tar down up again, so of course you can see it up here, up here, and I didn't have anything to clean it up. And as you see I had to put the tar all throughout the sealant, of course. Well if y'all ever run into a problem where you need to get tar off a vinyl, this is the best stuff to get guys. I'll tell you what, it was like $7 I can, but I'll tell you what, watch how good this stuff works. Because I don't want it coming off the roof that I just put it down on, I'm going to just get it off here, I'm going to spray it on my rag. Just show y'all, I already removed some down there off the house, but I'm going to just show y'all. You just take a rag, put it on your rag a little bit, and just watch this. All you do is just work it guys and as you see, if I was to. And spray it on there, I don't want it to drain down the house. And actually get it on the tar that I just put on there. But all you do is just wipe it on there. And I'm telling you about it just. It eats it up guys. So if y'all ever need, you ever put tar on something, you want to take it off, this is a good way to do it. And look at it, it's just, it just eats it up. So that's just a little tip for y'all. Hope you enjoyed it. And once again, there's a name of it. It was around, I'm going to say $7. I got it at the O'Reilly's, which you can put out any auto place, but I figured I'll show that to you guys. It works great.
