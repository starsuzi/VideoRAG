 Hi, I'm Jeannie and welcome to Jeannie's Martinis. Come on in. May everybody welcome back to Jeannie's Martinis. Today's drink is going to be an amaretto sour. Very simple, pretty much sub-explanatory, it just contains amaretto, any brand will do, and sour next. Start with a basic high-bore glass, basic cocktail glass, we're going to fill with ice. A three count of amaretto or halfway on the glass, whichever comes first. And then we're going to top it up with sour next. I'm going to grab a small shake and put it over the glass, turn the glass over, shake it up really good, take the glass out first, pour it in, add a cherry, and a straw. And there is your amaretto sour. So I hope you enjoy amaretto sour, until next time, cheers.
