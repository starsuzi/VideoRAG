 Okay, hey guys it's Lauren and Shirley. Welcome to Low Burn and Shirley. Anyway, so today we are making some turkey cupcakes. We are using party rainbow chips. Oh yes. So we're using, they're already baked. It's easy to cheat and then we have all of this stuff. We have this and from this we are going to somehow create turkeys on this. Oh we're going to create some good turkeys. I mean I'm just saying we've got we've got our aprons on. Shirley lost her hat. But I'm gonna find it. I've got my hat. Okay. Anyway, so we're going to go ahead and get started and it should be a lot of fun because neither of us know what we're doing and so hopefully you will just enjoy the process. Okay, Shirley. Hey Lamar. Look at our super cute. Oh my. It's still good. It's still good. It looks like fraggle rock. That's all I'm saying. Well, they're just all flat now. Oh snap. That's what happens when turkey. Aren't they both turkeys? It surely looks better than mine. Well, we had a lot of fun. We had so much fun making these turkeys and it was a great time.

Fun things to do with your kids. What are we gonna come up with for November? I don't even know. Anyway, okay, so every video that we do in the month of November, we're gonna say something that we're thankful for. So LeBern, what do you think before? I'm thankful for friends. Sure. I'm gonna go not super emotional here. Okay. I am thankful for really cute aprons. Oh yeah. Because check out these dorkal aprons that we're wearing. They really are cute. I've had them for so long. I'm no clue where we got them so I couldn't tell you. But they come at you. And they're really cute. So whoever invented aprons, I'm thankful for you. Alright, and then don't forget that we are trying to get to 500 likes. Yes. And if we get to 500 likes, thanks to I love slapstick, that is the YouTube name.
