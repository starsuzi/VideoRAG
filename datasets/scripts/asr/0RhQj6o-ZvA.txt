 Hello, the purpose of this instructional video is to demonstrate carbon's brush rub and love waffle iron cleaning procedure. This procedure will help prevent your waffle iron from sticking. Accessories needed for this is a Teflon Bristle Brush which is available for purchase from your local carbon's representative, a damp cloth, and a bowl of water. I'll now demonstrate the proper cleaning procedures. First take your brush, dip it in the water, then you brush the cooking surfaces of the waffle iron creating steam as you go. Once the baker stops steaming, take your damp cloth and rub the bristles until any residue has been removed. Continue brushing and rubbing the grids until your cleaning brush comes out clean. Please remember to also rotate your iron to clean the opposite cooking surface. Some important do's and don'ts to remember do use only plastic utensils with our waffle iron. Do clean your waffle irons at the end of each shift and do leave the waffle iron in the open position when it is on. Some don'ts include don't leave the waffle iron closed as this will burn the nonstick cooking surface and don't use metal utensils as this will scratch the surfaces. If you follow these cleaning procedures, you're going to love the results.
