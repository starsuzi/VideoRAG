 The first step to preparing leases is to remove all the tough leaves from outside. I'm making a tapered cut towards the center of the leaf. You'll remove all the tough outer leaves while leaving the more tender ones in the middle attached. Next, you'll want to make two lengthwise cuts from the base of the leaf all the way to the top. The idea here is to keep the base intact so you can open and access the inner leaves without falling apart. Next, immerse the whole leaf in a water bath when agitated vigorously. You want to run your fingers in between all the leaves to make sure you're carrying mother to do it. Notice how by keeping the base intact the leaf did not fall apart. After you chop, slice or dice a leaf, you want to take a second look and make sure that you remove all the dirt and debris.
