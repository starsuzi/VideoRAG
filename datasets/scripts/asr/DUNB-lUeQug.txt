 Thank you for looking at another use for our water absorbent pads. Every year the watering of hanging baskets and planters becomes a problem. But now by using the floodlock 175 soakup pads that problem is hugely reduced. Having peace of mind that you can go away for the weekend or on holiday and your containers will have a greater resilience to drying out. All that needs to be done is soak the pads for a few minutes to absorb the water. Then place them in the hanging basket or planter and score the white side of the pad, releasing the gel. Then planting is carried out as normal. For troughs the pads can be cut into strips and the same process carried out, giving great results. These pads are a much more versatile way of capturing and holding water than by other methods with an effective and clean way of enriching your compost. Thank you for viewing the floodlock soakup pads from all that's limited.
