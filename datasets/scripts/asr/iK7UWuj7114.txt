 Welcome back to episode nine. I want you to make some... I need barriers. I need fucking barriers in this bitch. Probably not. No, back wing! I guess, get shit. Give me that back wing, I need to help. I'm just gonna... Cook that shit. Better than nothing. Pop my nuts in the fridge. Dumpster! Here's some bacon for when you get on my bed. I think this gives you 20 hells. Just just got fucking, like, fucking got out of 40 sticks out if you need any. Okay, I'll take some. I got two more teeth, too. Found those ones, welcome. We got Ketsun as fucking forest down. Yeah, we do. I could use the wood too. I see those that get some morning. What I got two days left. I think Mac tusks should be spawning. Hopefully. I get more gold after that. Took that fire boy. That... I don't get fucking raped out here. Get that fucked. Make some flanks. Yeah, a little off of that, though. Just make sure he keeps some ice for it. I think we still got like 40 in there. Yeah, it's good. I think it's 15 for one since, too. Maybe we got 60 actually. Good shit. 41 and 20 in the other fridge. We got a lightning rod. Probably not. I mean, we might need that, all the shit growing. Oh, shit. It's fucking bastard. I can't get my ass. Okay, this is buddies. Damn, I don't think he had it. A little fucking loser. I just wanted to fly it up by the day. The darkness. See him? No. I can hear him now. All right, I'm gonna hurry up and get down there and see if he's spawned. I'll leave this there. This too. Kind of say the road again. Yeah, it's down the melt. Yeah, yeah. I'm thinking about a... Ah, fuck. Just thinking about it's eights. We gotta worry about the frog rain. It's pretty easy, damn. We gotta... I work on those traps when I go back, too. Those fucking traps work for that. Hounds. Good shit. I guess we're going caves. Actually, yeah, we can always do that, I guess. It's around the caves. When it's frog rain. Yeah. It was like no snow, no shit. That fucks out. Can you fucking get him? Planet, get him tree with the fucks going on. There I go. Just fuck it up. Yeah, we'll let him plant trees. That's weird. Yeah, I got him 27 cones on me. It was playing along the road. That was freezing out, I think. Warmed up, I was son. Let's get him. Nice. There should be ice like north east, right north east, or based by the other cave. I don't know, try and get it. Damn, he's on out, shit. You didn't come on it midway through. His thing's here, but he's just not there yet. Let's see the day left. I'm going to check the area a bit. Not damn it. What? I forgot to bring his shovel. I was another tree guy over there. You didn't, uh, can you make one? You have a no- Yeah, I guess you didn't have that made one. Yeah. Shit. Help me tree guy. I don't know if he fights spiders. I guess not. I'm deaf. That peg was just like sleeping on the ground and when I seen him, he was like, ran into his house. That peg? Yeah. Come on, spiders. Chase me forever. Come on, mold. Oh, I found like a little, this little like, pre-made forates. It's like, just a grass one, though. It's like, nothing good. I wish I had one of those chests. It's weird looking. I haven't seen one of these in a long time. Shower, I wish I had that handwork, and I could make one, though. Get some shift for two trips. Yeah. Maybe I'll just come back. Kind of full inventory. I guess I could link my shovel. Shower. Shower. Shower. Love you night. All right. I'm going to go back to the next one. Reason out. Yeah, yeah. I have to put my air muffs on. Runs back to his little like, it glue. It's probably like the last chance he could use there. Because I don't think he'd go down tomorrow. Oh, it Tuesday. Yeah. Peace shit assing out. I guess hopefully by next winter. Would see more in the map by then. There's anything I can do. Yeah, it's maps pretty far. It's a sweet ass bacon. It's baconator. You didn't make the baconator anymore? I don't think they do. I don't think they do, though. Yeah. It wasn't, it was kind of expensive. It wasn't like five bucks or something. Right. Yeah, I remember being kind up there. Worth? Well, it's bacon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't, it was kind of expensive. Well, it's bacon. Oh, yeah. Is it glue still here? But, it's not out, though. Maybe I'll stick around for a few more then. I was a hammer up here. Oh, yeah, I forgot I said I was going to leave that there. Oh, shit. Let me go over there and smash those things up. That springtime butterflies in back. Oh, yeah. We got to catch some of those and plant those on Foxx near the B-House so they don't fucking swarm around base and beat the shit out of us again. A bunch of assholes. These are piss. They got that red ass. Mm-hmm. A diaper ass. Hahaha. There's a tooth. Got a butterfly. Tastes like this, too. I guess this. Give me grass. No, it does give me grass. Oh, man, we're not used to it. What is? Oh, it's beating the shit out of the chest. No, not chest, sir. Fuck, without the move, it's ass. Get the stick. Follow me, chest, sir. I want to retard. Oh, I saw over here. Oh, shit. There's a lot of eyes over here. I might get back here up there. We're at it the best? Yeah, northeast. Well, that's that. Oh, yeah, I got most of those. Yeah, most of it. Yeah. All right, much like a Zagaloo see if it's still up. And if it is, maybe I'll stick around to it's actually gone. Today does make three days, but I guess technically one is over. But it's still up, though. He might come out for one more ass kickin'. Never know. Otherwise, if it makes a bunch of top hats. I guess I might too, because we could prepare him. Ah, it's gone. That piece of shit! I'm coming back. Err, err, errotic, too. Got a rotten egg? Yeah. It's always good for the gunpowder and shit. Watch, that's probably good to go back, man. Oh, shit. Get the juice next to us. Ah, fuck it, juice. Is he far away there? Nice, landed by the pond. Wow, the one right next to our base. I forgot they get fuckin' their nearpods. That ain't good. Are there just giant eggs around it? Not yet. Maybe we should try and kill him. How does those eggs don't hatch? We agree, I got it. You probably can take those. I know James showed me if you fucking build the fence around the egg. I think it was three by three. Yeah. And you light on fire? Once they're hatched, they won't, they're stupid, they won't have to. Here comes the rain. Alright, I got bees and bats chase my ass, huh? Another beating the shut-chester. Goddamn it. Come on, my boy. Not the rain, I'm too. Come on, Chester. I got you, bud. I'm here. Oh, yeah, I see that goose bitch. Yeah, you know, we're gonna fight him just yet. Holy fuck. Oh, yeah. I don't know, my spirits. I'm here. Pup himself. Good jerk here. That's a good shot. I think it was like 20 health, too. Mm-hmm. Getting some of these berry bushes planted. I'm not sure I like these ones yet. Like I like them. Because you get quick meat balls. But I mean, you're kind of screwed if you don't have a refrigerator. But I guess I think I might like them better. Actually, yeah, fuck it. I like them better. Because one thing gets me three bears. That means I get one meatball off it. I think I like them, actually. Man, always something going on in our base. That tells you what. That's 25 meatballs. Damn, we're stacked. We're gonna have 29 after this. I had to get yours all that fucking monster. Me as a gorilla. Cool, man, you're certain? Yeah. We could always just sell it up when it gets shittered on. Probably need a fling of max for those fucking bees, too. Come there fucking asses down. Yeah. We'll eat this bathroom quick, I'll be right back. Protect me Irish. Yeah, okay. Watch the goose guy come pick my ass. Yeah, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, suck. When I come back from the bathroom, are we gonna kick the moose goose's ass? Probably not because we suck, but find out next time. Are we gonna double team heal him? That's good. Is he getting everybody? I don't think so.
