 I'm Mary Anna Esposito for Food University. I make a lot of cookies. You could say I'm the cookie queen and I'm here to give you some tips about storing homemade cookies. Here we have some homemade cookies that I made. They're sugar cookies and they're a perfect candidate for the freezer as are a lot of other cookies. But you know you want them to stay nice and crisp and here you see that I've already frosted them. So how am I going to keep them? Well I like to use this press and seal and I take a couple of cookies just like that and just press and seal. Then I put them into a container like this. And I do all of the cookies exactly the same way. I cover the container and I put it in the freezer and that way I can take out as many or as few cookies as I need. It's a great tip especially if you're making cookies for the holiday. Put the top on and the freezer it goes. How about another tip for cookies? How about delicate cookies? Something like a nut cookie, a Russian tea cookie. Here's a tip that I learned from my mother. When you make delicate cookies and you want to freeze them, put them in your containers but layer them with pieces of paper towel. Can you see how beautiful those are? They're nicely sugared and there are no ice crystals on them. You make the layers, you put the paper towel over them, seal up the container in the freezer it goes and when company comes and the doorbell rings, you're ready.
