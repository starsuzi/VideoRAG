 We've got 12 pound of chips here. We'll put the bed earlier. Yes. Right. We're going to put them into the pan. How long have they been out of water? They've been out of water an hour. Right, okay. So you think a good hour of water to be able to water. Yeah, right. Right, nice and dry. You'll see. You're not wet, so it'll work. Yeah. We're going to put them in the pan. Yeah. Into a corner. Yeah. And pull the bucket away from you. Right. Yeah. So you don't get any fast splat back on. Okay. Put all the bucket in. Make some passing now to close the lid. Yeah. Obviously one of the things that we can notice is that as soon as the chips are going in, the actual needle goes back quite quickly. Yeah. And when the pan's obviously going to cut in in a few seconds, the actual dial will still go back and on. Yeah. Yeah. The burner is just cut in, okay. But it'll probably go back to maybe one twenty one, thirty before it actually settles. Okay. So it'll drop six to ten degrees. Yeah. Okay. Now obviously if you weren't going to fry quite as many chips, we wouldn't have our starting temperature quite as hot as that, okay. Because maybe if we were a bit quiet, we only wanted a few portions of chips at the end of the serving with the last few customers, we only put in half a bucket, okay. We wouldn't really want to be put them in at one eight five. Yeah. Otherwise they could be brown and almost burnt before they were burnt. Yeah, sure. Yeah, we would have to alter the temperature slightly to be perfectly honest, okay. I think already the temperature's back to one fifty. Slowly going back and forth again. Yeah, slowly going back, okay. Obviously depending on where they'd dry the chips, where where it's exactly eight four, it's going to go back. Yeah. But they're only now been in a few seconds and the temperature's gone already from one eight five down to one fifty. Coming into the marketplace now are some higher efficiency ranges and very good are an excessive 90% gas efficient. So you say considerable amount of money on your gas bills right away, okay. And some manufacturers will even say that you can cook product quicker in them because very often you don't have to have as much fat or as much oil in the pans. And even the frying temperatures will vary from traditional range. Okay, now we're going to lift the lid. Yeah, I will look. Okay. You can see all the chips are sticking together. Yeah, not separated. And the fat bubbling away that actually tells us that that fat is good, it's clean and it's fresh. And this should be okay. Yeah. If it was shot and dark and poor quality, the bubbles would all... First of all there would be a lot of froth, okay. But secondly the bubbles would be just flat for the one of a better term. Okay. You can see now if there was too much fat in the pan. Yeah. The fat will boil out. Yes, yes, quite important. Yeah. So it was obviously important not to overfill the pans either, the fat or oil. Okay. Then we'll close the lid. Yeah. Now I'm going to give it 30 seconds. Yeah. I'm going to give them a good shake. Right, okay. So what did you do that? I don't like to shake the chip too early. Right. So the fat can seal the chips. Yes. I'm not letting any excess water out. Yeah. That also breaks down the frown already. Right, yeah. Okay. So obviously frying at these temperatures is the same as the fish. If we put them in at around 185, okay. It's that hot that actually seals the product and the same with the chips obviously. That's right, yeah. Right. The last thing you want is a greasy chip. Yes, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right now I'll slowly just give them a little shuffle. And then close the lid. Yeah. So what about the others that you didn't actually turn? They're not worried they may stick to the bottom more. You're happy that you know. They're okay. At this point, yes. I do want to move all the chips. Right. Also, I don't want to move them too early. Right. Because I don't want the fat to seep in the chips to get them too greasy. So you'll see now I've moved all the chips. Yeah. So now stick to the bottom of the pan and then. Yeah. I'll cook in there to leave them there. Yeah. Then close them all. Okay, yeah. Okay. So what's the temperature we are at now? Yeah, see we're still at 150. So it's not dropped much below 150. No. Okay. But it's obviously not rising yet because that tells us that the chips are no one here cook. That's right. Yeah. It's not as hot as what it was. Right, yeah. Hey, Dougie. See if the chips are coming off really now. Yeah. Then the gum was cooked to make, Chris. What I'm going to do is just pinch one. It's doing nice and soft. So when you're pinching it, what you've been up for. Then making sure that the chips are nice and soft. Yeah. Obviously you've got to be quick. Yeah. That's interesting. You're noticing again that the utensil is slightly wholesome. Yeah. I see what I've noticed is that actually some fries do when they actually take that. They tend to. I've noticed that they give them a real good vine before they actually take them out. Okay. So. Not enough. So everybody has their own, what ways of doing things. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I've found one of the benefits of knocking the chips off before you actually put them in there. You've got less fat going in on the top of the chips. Yeah. I will point out it's also, you've got the quack quick. Yes. You want to get this lid shut? Yeah. Get the chips one. I see that my pan is almost as often as much as I can. I'm sure we're now if we actually went into the center of that pan, we would probably just get something out of the center of it. Okay. Yeah. I mean, it's not a great deal, but it's not the one thing that it's not doing. It's not doing it any good, you know. It's going to stick to your chips. Correct. Okay. And yeah, the next time we put a pan of chips in there, it will actually stick to the chips. So again, what's that's not a lot of waste in the bottom. The last thing that we need is actually in the pan, so we just get that out of there. Same thing again there and out. All right, okay. Now the chips are ready. A little portion on the tray. They'll do for me. They look pretty good to me. I'm going to have one, Chris. It's no good. I forget some salt vinegar on the go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
