 Hey, she's so stupid. She's coming handy. There's more water. Let go to the inside. It's very hard to put in my mom's case. She just throws a mop on the floor like a wrist. She stops off, roll up your pants and go get a towel and help. I got a video tape. I got a video tape. Come on, because I'm going to pick this time here. I'll put this right here. This is for my birthday. Thanks. My dishwasher with dish soap. Friends of you who don't know that you have to use the dishwasher liquid. This is why. She's trying to get a lot of questions. She's like, oh my god, I got to do something. Oh my goodness. Chris, you better take off your stuff. You made them. You made, yeah, you didn't. See? I never did it. I'm a few-ditty girl. Let's just cut and cut. Work in. You better not have to do it. Christian, just give it up. Take off your sneakers. You're so... Thanks for cleaning the floor. And the dishes, Christian. You can do that too. I really don't want to shampoo the car by now. Oh my god. It's never ending. Stop it. I didn't do that thing, but you should read it out. Christian. I know. Oh my god. The suds are coming out faster. You need to do something. The suds keep coming out. Christian, you did this. Soap bubbles suds. My suds. Everyone? See? Oh my gosh. Do it. Let's watch out.
