 Hey guys, this is J. I'm doing a saddle restoration video. So what you will need is a bucket of warm soapy water I'm using antibacterial soap. You'll also need stuff for cleaning like a toothbrush and saddle soap and cloths for cleaning and drying shoe polish and a bunch of cool. Trust me this comes in handy Okay, I'm just gonna start with my toothbrush and just scrub over the entire saddle with the warm soapy water and I'm just wearing gloves for this just because the saddle is not in the best condition So it just is easier, but you don't have to. I'm just choosing to and then give the saddle just to rinse off just rinse off all the soap And now I'm just getting my saddle soap and I'm holding it in one hand because it's just easier taking out the tub And just rubbing the cloth on it and then rubbing the cloth all over the saddle and just doing the underneath as well I'm flipping it over and just hosing it off afterwards to make sure there is no Soap left on the saddle because you don't really want that and now I'm just giving it a good dry off and Making sure I'm just trying all of it underneath the saddle flaps and the skirt and all of it and just using a towel So you can use a little cloth if you want to I just find it easier the big one and then flip it upside down And make sure you dry all of the underneath because the underneath is probably the most important because it's gonna be covered and Yep, just dry all of it flip it back over and give it one more complete dry and Then use the little cloth to get into the small hard to reach places and then once you've done that you can move on to the Sort of restoration stage. So just use purses to get off some loose threads which have come on down and now I'm using some shoe polish And it's the black shoe polish obviously if it's black saddle and this stuff is really great. It is Designed to go on leather boots so it works really well on a leather saddle and you just put it all around the edges and across Where it's rubbed up because it goes this kind of sandy orangey red color and doesn't look very good So just makes it look all black and new again and also gives it a bit of a shine So yeah, so just makes it just Restores it makes a little no pretty much and I'm just going over all of it and the seat and everything and the girth straps and I just tied the girth straps up using the Bungie cord which is really helpful Flip the saddle around and do all of the other side so getting all along the edges all across the saddle flap and the knee roll and the skirt and the seat and Yeah, just making sure all of it's clean and It's pretty much only the exposed areas because that's what people will see and it just makes it look really nice Though I can't recommend this doing this on a used saddle And I'm just using some glue and I'm going along both edges. I want to connect and just spreading it on thinly I'm just doing this because my saddle's come apart and yeah, I'm just want to fix it So I'm just holding it together for a few minutes and then just pegging it to hold it down So do it over the packet says now I'm just flipping the saddle over and just doing it on the other side because both sides are sadly broken and Yep, pegging that as well and then putting a cloth underneath the saddle flap to stop it touching the glue by accident So here are some before and after photos You can see the before photos it's quite moldy and in quite bad condition and in the after one that's kind of a blue effect Sorry about that. That's me changing the effect on my camera because it was really bright and sunny and Yeah, I've also missed a few After photos so if you want to see them just comment below and I'll post them on my Facebook at lots of And yeah, so as you can see the saddles a lot nicer So I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and it wasn't too long and boring and thanks for watching bye
