 Hello, it's that time of year now where summer turns into autumn. We've started to harvest the vegetables. We've got some rare's bent empty, we've got some pot's empty, we've got some bite's empty and we've got lots of compost. Now you may not have known its pH, what we saw vegetables. You may have had the right pH, you may have had the wrong pH and if you want to know the right pH the best thing to do is go to it. You'll find a chat somewhere on a website that you can print off and then you'll know the best pH for the vegetables you're growing. Okay, I want you to know the pH, the best pH for the vegetables you're growing. You really need to check the pH of the compost and soil that you're growing in and for that you'll learn a pH meter. I did a couple of videos last year and I modified my pH in the rare's beds using garden line and the rare's the pH, it was slightly acidic but the garden line helped with the rare's the pH and I'll go out and check it again later this year before I put the beds to beds or the speak before we overwinter them and if they need more line added I'd more line if they become more acidic they won't need more line and I'm all online on that by testing it. So I want to show you this. This is my pH meter and this is the boxy kermin or kermin. This motor performs four functions. It's a start position is always pH neutral it's 7 so when we switch this motor on it records the pH of 7 immediately and then when we insert the probe into the soil the compost that level will go all by down depending on what's in the pot in the black or in the rare's bed. Now let me show you this one and I hope you don't think I'm going to swanky here. I've actually got two of these guys and the reason I've got two is the first one I've got one I tried it out they line loaded in work and so when I was in the grilling house and in sugar bread I tested a level of for bright sunshine it was registered in the level that said it was dull couldn't believe it so I want to went out doors into the bright sunshine it was still saying that it was dull and so before I posted a comment I thought I'd let them know that one of the functions wasn't working and so I dropped a label to their technical department of technical support department and one of you all the same you know the one completely free so now I've got two soil motors and both of them work perfectly well when checking the pH of the soil or compost I'm using okay now what I found last year was that when I checked the pH outdoors that these can be difficult to say because they've got an LED screen particularly on sun ideas and even more difficult to video so I thought why don't we just take some soil from the rest of it put it in a pot break indoors tested indoors and hopefully you can say those things working better so that's what I've done okay so just put those to one side and this is the compost from the rest of it okay well we can say that I've just filled this 10 inch pot with compost from the raised bed so this should be reasonably representative but what I will do is I'll go around the raised bed and check the pH level at lots of different locations in the raised bed and then make an adjustment accordingly for now too but just to show you just to demonstrate those motors to you this this should do for okay taking a seat at the left of this pull it's going to go down nearly to the bottom of this pot okay so I'll switch these guys on that ones on and that ones on and the reason I'm using two is that if these guys work then you should get a very similar room on the perlum because they're going roughly in the similar kitchen in this compost they're only going to be inches apart anyway let me pop them in and let me say what we get on the on seven let me just check yeah the both recording the pH of seven now okay I'm not going to this on camera now it's a bit too difficult for me to say I can't tell if you can see what I can see but the ball of actually reading a pH of five now which is quite a acidic and this compost will need modified with lime there is bed will need modified and I will do that later on in the year there's one or two things still in the bed that I want out first and then I will modify that I'm going to try and give you a better shot of this I want to zoom in on this and what that you can see better okay I'm just about to insert these probes into the compost will be getting this okay well we're getting a pH of about five which is a city and it needs modified it needs modified with lime okay so now we know where we are now we know what to do so we'll be aligning the beds later on this year but not just at the moment because there's still a lot of some things growing in the beds I'd really like them to be empty before I do that but yeah this is what they want is not this is worth doing just looking at that compost in there that sort of there's no indication that it's acidic none whatsoever those guys are telling me it is those guys are telling me what I need to do what I need to do is add some lime to this and those beds are made top dressed and that's what I'm going to do okay so you'll be enjoyed this video this is a grown veg signing out
