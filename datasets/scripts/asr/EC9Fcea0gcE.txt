 For meat lovers, the no-way's philosophy of nose-to-tail eating is right on trend and it's great to see that veggie fans are jumping on the bandwagon as well with root to tip eating and something like beetroot fits that brief perfectly. Grow it from seeds or seedlings like these and plant them into a sunny spot with well-drained soil. I find the easiest way to plant these little beauties is to draw a shallow trench into the soil with your finger and pop the seedlings in, keeping them about 5 to 10cm apart. Now, run your hands down either side, filling in the trench and settling in the plants as you go. The warmer soils of spring and all that lovely sunshine will see these ruby gems jumping out of the ground in no time and the roots will be really quick and sweet to harvest. You can eat the young leaves fresh in salads or the older leaves you can actually cook up like kale or spinach. Beetroot is rich in a compound called beta lanes which studies suggest could be a weapon in the fight against cancer and it's this compound that gives beetroot its famous red hue.
