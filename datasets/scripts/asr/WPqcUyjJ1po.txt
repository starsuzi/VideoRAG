 Good afternoon. As you know, the government built to fund the government is coming up due through the House and then through the Senate. I want to make sure that we have an opportunity to talk about the administration's priorities and how they were funded through that bill. So today, we're going to have Secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly talk about what's in the bill to protect the country and keep our border safe. Ironically, when the Secretary is done, he's got to get right to a meeting with the President to talk about the wall and the efforts that he's making to drive down immigration legal boarded crossings. After he's done, Director of Management and Budget McMolvaney will come up to talk about the overall status of President's priorities in the funding bill and then take your questions. So without further ado, Secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly. Thank you very much again and thank you for letting me have a shout out to my wife. We'll see you guys just email where that wall is from exactly so we can identify the location. Appreciate it. John, please. Take shot. John! John! Come on, John. John. John, what are you about to do? John, where did you log go? He just said, oh, man. I thought, really? Yeah, where are you on the other side? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No one is just a known one.
