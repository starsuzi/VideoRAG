 Hey what's up my name is Patrick I am from the vintage hat company shop that is on Etsy today I'm just going to show you how to get rid of some bad smells that you might find in some hats so I recently got a shipment of hats and they all absolutely stink of grease or something similar so best and quickest cheapest easiest way to do it is get yourself a mailing bag some bicarb of soda and some acid-free white tissue paper or newspaper or whatever you want to use the reason I don't use newspaper is because the ink can come off that comes off on the felt game over mine so just get your tissue paper first of all this is like quite a big mailing bag an old one that I received something in so you just shove some of that in there you take this said smelly hat you get bicarb of soda make sure it's bicarb of soda not baking soda or cream tartar or whatever you put in your cookies you just really get it on to the felt because obviously that is where the smell is lingering I move that barbell there try and rob it in slightly to the felt just so it leases a couple of grains it might suck out some of whatever the health smells really bad then stick it in your mailing bag like so the best mailing bags have these little glued on strips are easy to seal you don't need to be like vacuum packed but I mean the tighter the best one just shove a load more paper in there I mean it's just all stuff to try and absorb the smell then just seal it up and just leave it now obviously the longer you leave it the better it really depends how bad the smell is but you've got to leave it at least about 48 hours then just leave it and hopefully it will come good if not seek a professional advice because I am not a professional but that is a cheap and easy way of doing it and I have fairly decent results so I am going to do a quick review of this one and I am going to do a quick review of this one and I am going to do a quick review of this one and I am going to do a quick review of this one and I am going to do a quick review of this one
