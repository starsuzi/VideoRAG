 Okay, so I thought I'd just show you quickly how to knot the edges of your ribbon so that they don't fray. Just get a lighter and you just want to gently knot put it in the flame but just gently run it along close to the flame and you'll be able to see it just slowly melting backwards a bit there. You don't want to burn the edges. If you do happen to, then no big deal. You can just trim it just slightly and then start again. So just going to find the other one which is over here. Just hold this one here too. There's the other ones out of the way so you don't want to burn those. And then just knot in the flame, just close to the flame and it will just melt it backwards a little bit. I don't want to blacken it just gently. There we go. Nice, sealed edges.
