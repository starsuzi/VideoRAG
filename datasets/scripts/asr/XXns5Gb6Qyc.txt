 I'm going to demonstrate the correct way to clean your table with quick clean. What I like to do is I like to hold the hair in about a 45 degree angle where I'm spraying out more than I am down. When I start my spray, I like to have it off the table. Spray time for your table should be 4 seconds. Let's give it a try. Start to spray off the table, bring it onto the table, down to the other end, back up the center, and then right where you're standing, and then wipe the table off as quickly as you can. What I like to do is have a separate towel to wipe my ratings off with so that I'm not pulling the dirt off this slate and putting the out here on the side from the side ratings. There, that's all there is to it and your table is ready for play.
