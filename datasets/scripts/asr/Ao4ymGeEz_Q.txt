You obviously loved it so much that you devoured mine, so you should obviously pick mine. So there's Kayla, but I had to smash my face in it because I had no spoon. That one's more sanitary. And there's Tyler's. So I got to eat that one with a spoon. She loved mine so much she went for a second bite. But Kayla's has multiple flavors and Tyler, but if I was blindfolded, I wouldn't know that one had less or more banana. But mine has more flavor. I'm gonna say, on flavor, I'm gonna say it's still a tie. But mine has more flavor. It says, chocolate's strawberry. Yeah, but I've got. What do you guys think?
