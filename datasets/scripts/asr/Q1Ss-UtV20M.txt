 Hi, my name is Risha Roxon, I'm a makeup artist. Today I'm going to talk with you about how to get rid of perfume smell on your skin. Have you ever accidentally doused yourself in way too much perfume, or perhaps just change your mind about the scent that you already have on? You might have noticed that just using soap and water doesn't do the trick and doesn't really remove the perfume smell. If you want to remove perfume from your skin, I have a couple of easy tricks. Number one is to soak a cotton pad and vinegar and swipe all over the perfume area, which in this case is her wrist. You rub the white vinegar on and you leave it to set for 10 to 15 minutes. When you're done, you simply wash with soap and water, pat dry, and the smell of perfume and vinegar are both gone. Now vinegar has an astringent effect. If you perhaps want a moisturizing effect, you should soak the cotton pad in olive oil or really the oil of your choice. I'm going to use the whole oil. Swipe the oil all over the perfumed area using a generous amount. Leave this to soak for 10 minutes. When you're done, wash normally with soap and water, pat dry, and voila, no perfume smell. My name is Visha Roxon. I've just told you how to get rid of perfume smell on the skin. Thank you.
