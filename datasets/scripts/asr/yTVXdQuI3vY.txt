 I'm going to show you how to unclog a sink. The tools that I'm going to need for this is the plunger. I'm going to need some gloves and I've got some drain cleaner as well. So what I'm going to do first is use the plunger to unclog the sink. We've got water in the bowl at the moment, which means that there's nice big blockage inside the pot. So we're going to use the plunger and clear the blockage first and then as a precaution we're going to put a bit of drain cleaner down there afterwards just to make sure we get rid of any other residue. Anything's can block a sink. Here I would assume that it might be food scraps or stuff off of the dishes, but you could have hair of it in the bathroom and even tree roots can get into the drains. So what I'm going to do now is take my plunger. I'm going to place it over the drain hole and I'm just going to pump the plunger. As you can see it's drained nicely and there's nice free flow of water now. So what we're going to do is pop air gloves on and we're going to use some of the drain cleaner just to make sure that there's nothing else left in the pipes. Okay, so I've got my gloves on now. I'm going to mix up the drain cleaner. It's really important to read the instructions on the pack before you mix it up. So I've put the dry drain clean in. Now I'm just going to add some water and then we'll wait the 15 minutes like it says on the package and then we'll tip it down the sink. Okay, so we've waited the 15 minutes has stated on the bottle. Now all we have to do is tip it down the drain. We just have to leave it the appropriate amount of time and then wash it down with clean water. That's how you unblock a sink.
