 Today I'm on secret station we're blowing up a bloom with baking soda and vinegar. Hi I'm Rai-Lan today you'll need a bottle made of glass or plastic. Two funnels because they're super fun! I think that's why they're called that. And some vinegar and baking soda and... Here's my blue. First we're going to fill our bottle halfway with vinegar. Now fill your bloom with baking soda. Now put your balloon on top of your bottle and don't spill any baking soda yet. Now dump the baking soda in and lock your bloom below up. Cool huh? This one's big! The baking soda and vinegar create an acid-base reaction. From their mix they create carbon dioxide gas which expands and needs somewhere to go. The gas moves up and out of the bottle. Billing and it's banding the bloom. Thanks for watching and see you next time. Massing what kind of music do you want to play? I don't know. Pop music. Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe.
