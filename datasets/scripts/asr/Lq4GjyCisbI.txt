 To flamb√© just means to fire off the liquor. So what we're going to do is we're going to start with a hot pan, and I'm just going to use mushrooms as an example here. I'm going to saute up some mushrooms and to add the flavor of the liquor without adding the alcohol, I'm going to pour in the alcohol. When I do this, it's going to catch on fire. You want to be very, very careful. You never want to pour from the bottle or the whole bottle could catch on fire. If your liquor doesn't catch on fire because you have an electric stove, you can just use a flame-thrower and that will go ahead and ignite the liquor for you. Just be very careful.
