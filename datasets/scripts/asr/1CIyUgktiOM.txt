 Start with a small pinch of clay in your hand. You can press it with your thumb or your palm to make it as thin as you can. Once you have it, carefully roll up the piece of slab. And it will look like this. Now put this piece down and repeat the process like before. It is ok if it is too thin and you accidentally tore it, you can just put it down and use it later. As you can see, the shape of this small slab does not matter. Before we wrap the slab around the first piece, we are going to put some slip onto the first piece. Then gently wrap the slab around the first piece like this. The small shaped slab actually make the piece more natural. That will usually be excess clay at the bottom, so just pinch it off. This is going to be my third and last petal for this flower. You can actually make more and make the flower bigger as you wish. Just keep repeating the steps and adding more to your flower. Once you have made the flowers, you can attach them to any artwork that you have made. Manki see, Manki like, Manki do. Canaramana.com
