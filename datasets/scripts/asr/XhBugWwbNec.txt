 When I was a kid my grandfather used to freshly milk from the cat and my granny she used to reserve some of that milk for us and she used to make curd at home with that fresh milk and it used to be so thick and creamy in just one word I would say it used to taste yum and the curd that you make it at home tastes hundred times better than the store bought ones and the best part is you only need two ingredients to make this curd that is the whole milk and some old curd from your previous batch now if you're making curd regularly of course you will have curd at home if not start off with the store bought ones and then continue from there you will never buy curd again from the supermarket so let's see how to make the curd first I'm going to add five cups of whole milk into a saucepan and we'll bring this to boil and the medium low heat once the milk comes to boil we'll switch off the flame and we'll let the milk cool down for about 15 minutes until the milk is warm to the touch now don't let the milk cool completely the temperature you should look for is about 110 degree Fahrenheit that is approximately about 45 degree Celsius after 15 minutes transfer the milk into any kind of pot that you want to make your curd in my case I use this beautiful earthen pot because I like the taste of the yogurt when I make in these kind of clay pots now keep your little finger for about 5 to 10 seconds in the warm milk if you feel the urge to remove your finger from the milk your milk is still hot and it needs to cool down rather if you're feeling comfortable then it is the right temperature to add the yogurt cultures now in goes about one fourth cup of yogurt and will mix it well now if you're in India most places in India is pretty warm throughout the year so all you can do is just leave it on the countertop with closed lid for about 8 to 10 hours and your yogurt will be set but in my case I'm in New Jersey and it is winter here I can't just leave it on the countertop so what I do is I turn on the bread rising more it is about 110 degree Fahrenheit the same temperature of the warm milk and believe it here for about 8 hours and after the 8 hours my curd is well set and you will know when you just touch it should be formed so here you go very tasty and yummy homemade curd is ready so now that you know how simple it is to make curd at home why do you still want to buy it so make it and do let me know in the comment section below and if you would like to see more such yummy and simple recipes all you got to do is just hit on the subscribe button and get subscribed if you need the recipe of course you don't for this recipe but in case if you need it just log on to megascookingchannel.com and get the complete recipe thank you so much for watching I'll see you guys soon bye bye
