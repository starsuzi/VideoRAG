 Hey guys, since today I'm going to show you how to make this awesome lamp using an old bottle. You will need a glass bottle, spray paint, lights and some paint brushes. So I'm going to start off by spray paint in the entire bottle white. Next I'm going to take my black paint and draw a design on the bottle. You can draw any design you want to. I'm going to draw a tree. I'm also going to use some stickers to make it more decorative. Lastly take your fairy lights and put them in the bottle. And there you go, your very own bottle light.
