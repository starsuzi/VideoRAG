 Hey guys, it's me Thunderbird1939 and today I'm going to show you how to build this mechanism I usually use it mostly all my knocks. So yeah, at the end I'm gonna pick this up over that mechanism. So here it goes. So first of all, this mechanism to build it you need a let's see you need this whole lot. We just get this grease out. Oh who shares that? Using this blue piece because it is a very important part of the mechanism and I've already showed this in one of my videos. I don't I think it was. Maybe I have it but I think I have. So I'm just gonna show this again for those of you who haven't seen my video but I'm not sure if I have. I think I deleted that video. So yeah. So you need this blue piece and that black piece was a hole going through it. Then you need if you want a couple of chains this other blue piece right here. This steering wheel type of piece and this technique piece and last one of this. So first of all you need to put this piece blue piece into this technique piece like this and then you did attach that to that. Before you know you can't if you already have this piece out you just have to put it in there and then you're gonna attach this that and then you're gonna get this piece and put it in the steering wheel type of piece and then you got to put it in here and yeah you pretty much have your make it as a good. And if you want you can attach chains I have two trims here and I'll be showing you how to pull this up. Let me just touch this. Here are those. You just gotta hold that down because you know it's kind of fragile. And there you are. Let's see how you will make it this up. So I hope you like it. Rate, comment and subscribe. Senator Burnett you did 39. Side of y'all. Bye guys.
