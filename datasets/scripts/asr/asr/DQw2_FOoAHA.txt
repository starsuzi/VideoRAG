 Welcome to socialc.com.au.co.uk Today we're going to be making our armadillo sarr and we're going to stuff with our armadillo. So we're going to be using 50 ml of our armadillo today and then we've also got 25 ml of our lemon juice, 12.5 ml of our simple syrup and then we've also got a dash of our angistera aromatic bitters and also a dash of egg white as well. So we're going to start just with our armadillo. So we're going to use a whole double measure, so 50 ml of our armadillo. And then we're just going to use our technique of halfing you're doing. So we start off with a spread. We've got 50 ml of our armadillo and we're going to have it, so you're sorry, we're doing and we're going to use lemon, so it's just 25 ml of lemon. And then we're going to use our halfing ingredient again, so we're going to have it, so you're sweet. I'm just going to use our measure to measure half the measure of simple syrup. So two well point five nils for simple syrup. And then we're just going to use a dash of our egg white. And once again, that healthy dash of our aromatic bitters. And then because we use our egg white in our drink, we're going to use a dry chic technique, goes up. So it's going to shake it up and raise the leg with our egg white. And then we're just going to add our nice. So we're just going to use our nice, just going to call it a new shake out. Here. Same thing as to give it a good touch, using the seals, right? Don't worry about any shake. And just to bring the seal, we're just going to tap it on the side. And to the glass, we're using today, we're just going to give it a nice rock glass. And we're just going to fill up our cup dyes. And we're just going to use a single strainer, any strainer drink into our glass. And for our glass, we're going to be using a lemon zest. And we're just going to spray the oils across the glass, and then we're just going to top the garnish in. So this is our amreloasare.
