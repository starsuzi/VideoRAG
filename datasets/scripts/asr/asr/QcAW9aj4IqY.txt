 Hi, I'm Sophie from Beavis Good Food and I'm going to show you how to use Filo pastry. Filo pastry originates from Greece and it is one of the pastries I recommend buying because it's really hard to achieve this type of paper thinness when you're making it at home. As you can see I'm keeping it covered with a clean damp tea towel. This just stops the pastry drying out whilst you're working with it. This pastry can be used for a variety of sweet or savory things and today I'm going to show you how to make some really nice breed triangles with the Filo. So I'm just going to get one sheet of pastry. And whilst I'm working with it I'm going to keep the rest covered so it doesn't dry out and I'm going to carefully brush this with melted butter. If you're trying to be healthier and you don't want to use butter you can use a little bit of olive oil instead. So you just want to evenly coat the Filo pastry. Don't brush it too hard because it does have a tendency to break. That's all nicely coated in the butter so I'm just going to put another layer of Filo on top. Now I'm going to show you how to make some really nice little Filo parcels filled with Bree and cranberry sauce. To do this you simply cut down the middle using a sharp knife. I'm just going to slice a couple of bits of Bree and then put a spoon full of my cranberry sauce in the corner of one of my lengths of Filo. Once you've put your filling in the middle brush the edge with a bit of melted butter then fold your first triangle over itself. Pressing it down to secure then a bit more melted butter. Fold again. Seal down those edges and carry on folding until all the edges are sealed. Then cut away any excess pastry. Brush the whole of the parcel in melted butter. For some extra decoration I've just got a few black sesame seeds here. Fate these Filo triangles in a 200-degree oven for 10-15 minutes and there you have a really simple and easy way to use Filo pastry from BBC Good Food.
