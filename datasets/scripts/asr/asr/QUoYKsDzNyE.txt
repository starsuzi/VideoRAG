 Hi I'm Ray Thomas. I'm the owner of Ray's auto repair. Today I'm going to show you how to clean an air filter. What you do is you open the hood and then you look for the air filter box. It's a housing. Usually it's black. What you do, there's clips there, you pop it off and usually pops off like this. Then the air cleaner comes out. What we do in the shop is we use compressed air to blow it out. If you're at home you don't have compressed air what you do. You just kind of dust it off like this. And then hopefully most of the stuff comes out. Now if it's really dirty with oil and stuff I recommend you replace it. But if it's just regular dust you can just dust it off and then just put it back like so. And make sure there's arrows where it goes in whether in or not. Usually you can't go wrong with it. And then you just go like this and then you just clip it off. That's it. And this is how you clean an air filter.
