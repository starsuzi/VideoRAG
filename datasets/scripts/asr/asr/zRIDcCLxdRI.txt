 Where I'm from, this is what Japanese breakfast is like. Mommy! Right now, my mom is making eggs and it's called kamagoyaki. Little bit. Smash it and make it mooshy. I never made one. I didn't know it takes a long time to mix it. It's mixed it a lot. It's time. That's not a lot of egg. Wait, another tiny egg. You're doing softly. Mix it in the water. I think she has a lot of pressure on her to make the best egg. She's getting nervous. Oh no. Let me put it again. I think it will need eggs for sure in the mouth. I can't what do you think? Wow. Does egg usually have maple syrup in it? That's ingredient. No, we have to use sugar. We don't have it, so we need maple syrup. Make it yummy. So, what are you making next, I think? I'm making me so sure. Like soup. My grandpa grew this spinach. So what's this here? This is cornfruit. It's kind of like sponge. Wow. We put it all in. What's this? What's this? This. Wow. It's delicious. Oh, it makes the soup. Grounded fish broth called bonito. Fish powder. And that's the miso. That's mixing. So I didn't mix the soup. I didn't mix it in part. I just mixed it in that little spoon. It's done. This is soup. It's so sure. This is good. This spinach smells good. The spinach. Oh, so what did you get now? I'm getting it. What are you trying to eat already? That is good. You can eat it all the time. This is ume bushi. If you eat it, it's spicy. So. What is ume bushi? I don't know, it's saying red sea. It's pickled plums. That's what it is, I don't know. Yeah. They don't spill this. Why did... Okay, she's going to test it. No, she's a watchman. So the kids can... Okay, okay. Next is mini sausage. These make it mini sausage after work. Yeah, this is fun on this bit. Okay, two sausages, it's very good. You need real octopus too, right? I don't. I like it. I just forget. No, it's good. It's possible. Three. Does your mommy make this breakfast every morning? No, every morning. But sometimes she makes sausages. It is special. So I'm going to make it not though. This is soy beans. I think you're going to take this off. Why is it so sticky? I don't know, it's so good on it. Okay, I like it. Soy sauce. And mix it. You can't until it gets white. Like this. I don't know if like you like it but definitely people like it. That's a salad. I don't know. It's so yourself. Do you always have your breakfast so pretty like this? I don't know but definitely people make it pretty easy. So your missile series here, your rice is here, the panway is here, your nuttles here, and your sausages are here. Itadakimasu. The first time I'm going to eat from the egg. I really like the octopus. Do you ever figure out if it's an amiso soup and then make it swim? I need a tofu burger. Then the spinach. These good. We have chopped it. So we chopped this with aniseum. So then how do you drink your soup? You get a spoon like this. But now I'm not going to eat like this. What's your leg there? Yeah. Why not? Even you can't do it that because you call it say galodine. And then that's like that looks like you're not allowed to do it out. I do that all the time. Yeah but that's the manner as I eat it. Then make the nutto. And then if you like it. Let's do close up this. Oh yeah, get on the nutto. Yummy yummy. Get the ingredients.„Åí The next going to rice equation And I'm sorry. I don't know.
