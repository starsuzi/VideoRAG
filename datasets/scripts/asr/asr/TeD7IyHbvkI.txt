 I do love my beetroot and you know there's this thing in the UK about eating your five a day are you eating your five fruit of edge a day but you know in other countries they're talking about 15 20 25 different types of food different types of fruit and veg different colors very importantly of food you know because these guys are packed full of goodness and they got some antioxidants and anthocyanins and all sorts of things in there which give you protection from specific diseases and beetroot will help you against one or two particular things and then a different colored fruit maybe a carrot will give you protection from another range of illnesses and conditions so the more different colors you can eat if you've got a rainbow of food that you can eat you're going to get a broader spectrum of protection and goodness in your body and that's a step before I don't look like this I don't look as good as this without you know for no reason it's because I eat such good food and exercise regularly so beetroot so full of goodness blood pressure they help stabilize blood pressure they help you with your what they call it concentration even it's rumored to be an afrodizia haven't tried that myself but so gentlemen if you're thinking of a nice present for your wife on a birthday pound of beetroot perfect so let's have a go at sewing some now let me show you how to grow these little beauties from seed so sewing beetroot seed we're here now in the UK early April sometimes you could do it late March you just want to wait for the soil to start to warm up we get some nice nice warm weather and the soil that we dug you know a few weeks ago or back in the autumn still quite lumpy there so what I'm gonna do where I'm gonna sow the seed I'm just kind of working through with a fork you could use a hoe or a rate but I just like to use a fork here it goes a bit deeper if you want a bit of a refreshment on how to kind of dig your veg properly you can have a look at our other video clip on how to dig and we'll give you a link to that video clip at the end of this one for no extra charge so you can see now that the we're breaking up the big lump here because the little seeds won't cope with big lumps so we're just getting a nice what they call a fine tilt so if you're reading the gardening books and they're talking about a tilt ti l th tilf is this stuff nice crumbly small lumps nice fine soil the sort of stuff that seeds could grow into let's sow some seeds give me some shade so having kind of worked the fork through I've got with the the lump I'm just making a little kind of shallow drill a little kind of a tiny trench only a centimeter or two deep in the soil into which we're gonna put our seed I'm growing two colors of beetroot this year your purple ones you know your common ones but also gonna try some white ones apparently got some lovely flavour there so it's you know that again different colors different tastes and different levels of protection within your body so let's have a closer look and get some seed in the ground shall we? so here's our little drill that we've made it's only a a centimeter or two deep and here's our seeds okay so I'm just gonna very lightly scatter those I'm not believe are in in straight lines I don't think nature works from straight lines I'm doing a slightly wider drill here little trench than other people might it's just means that we can get a few more into the space and if you've got a few gaps in between your beetroot it means they can swell up even bigger so in that little patch there quite a few seeds might be more than we need but the nice thing about beetroot is if they all come up and you've got too many you can wait until they're kind of marble size and pick them out pick out some of them and eat them as young kind of baby beetroot and allow the rest of them to swell up so having got the seed in there I'm just gonna gently scatter I break up the big lumps and I've just lightly covering that that seed with a nice fine soil now we're living in whales and they forecast rain on the weekend and this soil is still quite damp so I'm not going to worry about giving them any any water and we're well blessed on the rainfront him in whales but if they forecast a drought then you need to give these guys a little drink of water and keep them on the mice side for a week or two until they've until they've germinated so I'm going to do one row here of my of my my purple seeds and then I'm going to do the white ones you need to leave a good fork distance between each row so I'm going to start doing my next row along here breaking up those lumps there again my little down my little trench and then what I'll do is probably in about a month's time I'll do another sewing on the back end of this bed so that we've got a succession of of crops coming through right through until the until the autumn so it will be feeling healthy and my memory will be spot on and my labido might be quite healthy as well fantastic who wouldn't want to eat beetroot ah
