 on the ingredients he used and I kind of just guess what he did and I pretty much figured it out and I have to make a video in English but I know I guess I could do the same thing also. I hope this helps y'all. Alright this isn't pink enough yeah. Okay remember when I did it I just popped it but I did add more to it. Remember when you add more of this it's also liquid in here so like I said the more liquid you put in here the saltier it's gonna get which you know it's gonna be pretty salty at first which is fine but you don't want it to get extremely salty. I did ask him the person I wanted it I tried it over a message about what the soap does for the sand why why soap and water instead of just straight water but he never replied back and I guess I guess I'll never know what what the soap does to the color but I'm adding more to it this is like my third or fourth and I added quite a bit more as you can see I like my colors to be really really vibrant. If you do food coloring if you do food coloring with the sand and water just straight water no soap or anything you can do that but what you'll have to do is you have to keep you have to let the sand dry and then you'll have to do it like maybe four or five more times to get the true color you want I've been looking for ways to make sand vibrant I love vibrant sand clothes and I can't find any online so like I said when I found this I was really happy about it when I actually get to try out but this is this is pretty good so far even if there's these colors right here these types of paints you can even make some you know like two colors to make whatever color you want so instead of getting green you can buy just yellow and blue and make green but it has to be aquamarine and yellow and if you get any other color of blue it's gonna turn it like an acoe brown color so make sure you get aquamarine and yellow but you can mix two colors together to get whatever color you want and it's they mix really well that's what a lot of artists use today is the master touch acrylics and those are my favorites that's the ladies from all of them are paintings and stuff but this is kind of it's it's not the vibrant vibrant color yet but I mean it's close it's getting there okay this is one more time I'm gonna do this and then see how this turns out like I said the more color you put the brighter it's gonna be and there I got even brighter I'm sure online on the video okay you can't really see it but it's it's pretty bright it's pretty bright there I like it it looks good oh yeah I mean I can do it like you know even I want nine more times but I mean I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna just do the last night but what I was saying when you have the food coloring and water you can do that but it'll people like to bake them and that's fine and on to dry on faster but it's it's gonna fade it it's gonna take it to a lighter color like a pastel blue or pastel red and it's not really gonna look right it's something to have the color of sanding now also so it's not really gonna work too I kind of like to wait on mine and it does take at least three days to dry out but you had to put it out on like a baking sheet or a pan but this is basically my regular basically the color and I can go brighter than that if you want but I recommend get the beer bottles there are a dollar more this is 399 at Hobby Lobby a few it for the sale you can get it for 40% off or you can use their coupon for 40% off on that but with this right here and it's pretty much all done and so you kind of looks like the kind of like icing it's kind of like icing it feels like icing and when I touch it just a little bit at least at least just a little bit on my finger there and I mean the color doesn't come off because it's paint once the paint's in there it's in there and I don't know it's pretty good once it's you let it set for about four or five hours it gets really soft this one didn't have bubbles in it I don't know I'm gonna add a little bit of soap I'm not sure if I add enough soap to the you don't have to do this you want to add it to the water but usually I see like bubbles in there in the sand and here you can't really see them on the video and show but I can see them here a little stretched bubbles in the sand for a mix and that's not pretty good just by moving the kind around with the spots like this there you go like that's the yeah the bubbles come in okay like I always do and I know I always do this but I over did it what's it the liquid which is great because this way I can show you go ahead add this in here I just sifted it I did sift it but I mean if you want to have more sand aside that's fine I would do that what way you know you know how to worry about it but I didn't have any I put it on must have it all in there but you want to see some bubbles and just the tiny little as bubbles in there just to make sure there's enough soap but you can see I don't know if you can see in there the little little shimmers in there are actually bubbles there's one right there and then I don't know if I can point it out here one right there all right pretty much done now I'm gonna set this aside because I'll mess with this in a minute but the next step is to get a flat tray of some sort I got a tray that's uh this is a a tray that I had from plants my plant obsession and I put down a piece of wax paper and basically um let me wash this off a quick okay what I do is I just smooth it in there kind of like you do like a cake basically um it's just just smoothness in there rough flat it's just kind of thick no it's probably about that the air crystal it's not that much yeah it's just a little thickness but see I mean I mean I mean it's this has been drying for about four and a half hours and I mean it's not even stuck to my hand anymore it is still really soft it does feel like mixture between frosting and play-doh but you can see the color and there is really really vibrant I mean I wish my video would be able to show it but the color just comes out amazing um once you set it in there uh just put it aside somewhere where the cat signing it to the dog or or anywhere I have it sitting in one of our uh back rooms it's just sitting there in the dark and it's doing fine um after this um you be done with this uh in about three days it'll look like this right here and it's just this really really nice I mean the colors and the texture hand or anything which is a good indication that it won't stick to that it won't come off I haven't tested yet to see if it will bleed I'm sorry I haven't tested it that I know it's bad but uh I'm gonna test it and probably make a video of that um but there's a lot of uh little uh what's it called clamp still in there you need to be broken out so if you get um this right here what you can do is put it back through the uh the fish cut you can put quite a bit and then I'm just get the sifter I mean the whisk in there and it helps it push it through a little bit more and also it'll break up all the little crumbs and clumps that are still in the sand and I don't know if it's showing sorry if I didn't show that let me pull this back a bit okay okay there it goes okay yeah it's getting through faster a lot faster than it then it would be if you just just sorry about my hair it looks so crazy right now it's nighttime and I really don't care I don't know if it's shortly wasn't really you may have to look show myself on the video but I guess too all right here he goes there's still clumps in there the best thing about this is you can crumbly it up and I need to take it out and do it this way and try to crumb a little more like that and you can use your hand in there also and use your fingers to crumb it up inside there and I don't know how I got sediment in there oh I didn't clean out oh yeah that's fine it had a little bit of sediment from the sand I just sifted but and that's it that's basically back to sand again but the sun is color
