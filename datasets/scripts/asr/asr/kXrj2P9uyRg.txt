 Hello, this is Elaine with another quick tip for you on how to stop your ribbon or twine from fraying. So usually when you have twine, the ends tend to fray a bit. It can be frustrating because it makes your project not look as clean and finished unless you're going for the frayed look. So a trick that I do is I use crystal effects and I just actually open up the top and I just stick my twine or ribbon right in there. And then I'm going to go ahead and get a whole lot just to show you. But you're just going to use a napkin and just kind of re twist it in there so you don't get your fingers so sticky. And then you're going to let it dry and then you can trim it off and then you're going to have this perfect cut edge that's not going to fray on your twine. Another thing that you can use it for, you'll see here is I've got some on the edge of the organza ribbon and I can just trim that off when that dries with my craft and ribbon scissors and that's going to create a really nice nice edge on your ribbon. But the best is using it on this baker's twine, especially the ones that have the gold and the silver inside them because it always seems like they're wanting to come out and I can't keep them in in the project and they're starting to unwind and it just dries me crazy. So a fun tip is to just try to wind it back in and then you just stick it in the crystal effects. You can kind of wipe a little bit of it off but then once that dries that gold or silver is going to stay put and you're going to have this beautiful gold or silver highlight in your twine in your project that's not going to go anywhere. So I hope you've enjoyed this tip and that it's been helpful to you in your crafting. Thanks for watching.
