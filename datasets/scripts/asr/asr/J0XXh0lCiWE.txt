 Hi, I'm Sean from Spectacularly Delicious and today we're going to be making turduckin sausages. Turduckin is usually that large turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with chicken stuffed with sausage and then baked. I'm going to be making sausage links that involve all those ingredients to turkey, duck, and chicken and sausage, but in a sausage link so it'll be a lot easier to cook. So we're going to be using, I have here a mixture of my duck meat, dark meat turkey, white meat turkey, and dark meat chicken. I do have some pork fat to make sure that the sausages are nice and juicy and I just want to show you these are sausage casings you get from the butcher and this is what we will fill, we will fill these casings with the stuffing. So what we have here is the food grinder which is an attachment you can get that fits on your kitchen aid stand mixer and we will take our poultry which has been chopped into one and a half or two inch chunks and we're putting it in this top tray which is called the hopper and we're going to then turn the mixer onto the four setting and we will use the stomper to push the meat through the grinder. Here it goes. If this won't make a vegetarian out of you, I don't know what will. So we're pushing the ground meat through the grinder again only now we've attached the funnel to the grinder which we've put the sausage casings over so you can see that as the meat is pressed through the casing comes off the funnel and you can just twist it and there you have a link and so you just keep pushing it through and filling the casings until you've got all of your sausage meat inside your sausage casing. It's really not very hard at all. Here we have our completed sausages, our turducken sausages, turkey chicken duck, seasoned with some creole style flavorings and the complete recipe is on spectacularlydelicious.com
