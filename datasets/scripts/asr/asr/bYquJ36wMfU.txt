 Hello, it is rug lover Mary and I'm here to highlight a very unique area rug that we got in today. At first glance it looks like it is the under-ped for an area rug but it is not. It is actually a half inch thick gray felt area rug. Six squares were sewn together and it has perforated holes in it. This is the first of this type of rug I've ever seen. I'm just gonna zoom in for a sec. These are the holes that are cut in. They're up with an inch long. It looks very nice to highlight the hardwood floor underneath. That's how thick it is and it literally is just a felt area rug. The client bought it about eight years ago and van Cooper British Columbia and it is a very modern looking rug. This is the first time we've seen it here at Love a Rug which is kind of cool. We like to showcase the unique rug that we get in here. So if you have a unique rug bring it on in and I can blog about it. This is rug lover Mary. Thank you.
