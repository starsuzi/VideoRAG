 If you google overnight oatmeal you will see a ton of beautiful mason jars filled with oats, milk, yogurt, lots of toppings including seeds, fruit, nuts, just the possibilities are in list with this recipe. And feel free to adjust the ratio of milk to oat oats to your liking. I like mine a little bit thinner. Some people may like it a little bit thicker. If you're looking for a quick breakfast in the morning and more than alternative to dry cereal, this recipe might just be for you. You can make it as healthy, as simple, or as decadent as you like. For the apples, add a small amount of water to the bottom of a heated pan. Add the apples and cover the pan. Let them steam for 10 to 15 minutes. While the apples are steaming, pour a half cup of old fashioned oats in a container. These aren't the quick oats, they're the old fashioned ones. Add 1 cup of non-dairy milk, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and an 8 teaspoon of salt. Mix it all together. When your apples are done, add a half a cup of them to the oats. Stir it all together and put it in the fridge overnight. In the morning, take it out and you can eat it as is or add crunchy toppings. I like to add a half cup of fiber 1 cereal, just add a little crunch and give it a fiber of boost. It's really hard to describe the texture of this oatmeal. It's not like cooked oatmeal, but the oats are very soft. So you'll just have to try it and see what you like. You can heat it if you want to, but I usually just eat mine cold. And like I said before, the number of ways you can adapt this recipe is endless. If you try it, let me know what you put in your comments. Thanks for watching. Be good cooking with love.
