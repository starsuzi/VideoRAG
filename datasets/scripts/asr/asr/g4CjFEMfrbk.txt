 Hi guys, I'm going to show you how to make bread sauce, a classic British side dish for roast turkey. I need 700 milliliters of whole milk and an onion that's been studied with four cloves. I also need two bay leaves, some salt and pepper and a few grates of nutmeg. Bring up to the boil then simmer for five minutes. Now remove from the heat and let that infuse for 15 minutes. I need one and a half cloves of ready-to-bake trebatta. Remove the crusts and pulse in a food processor until you've got nice coarse breadcrumbs. Strain the infused milk into another saucepan, bring up to the boil then reduce to a simmer. Gradually add handfuls of breadcrumbs until you get the consistency you're looking for. To thin, add more breadcrumbs, to thick add a splash of milk. Finish with 30 grams of butter and 20 milliliters of double cream and that's how you make bread sauce. For more tips, click on the link.
