 Hello everyone today I want to show you a toddler schedule task board and this is the schedule board that I use for my children so that they could start being responsible and getting to the habit of taking care of their own Environment and taking care of themselves at an early age and It also helps them build organizational habits that will help them later on So let me go ahead and show you what this board consists of So here we have Morning tasks so all the tasks that are to be done in the morning the child's names here You can even add a third one if you have three children and Here we have the tasks So we have make bed And that is the first thing that is done in the morning Make the bed and my Hold this child is going to be four in the summer and she makes her own bed every morning It's not perfect, but she does really well for her age. I think Just getting them into the habit of once they wake up doing their bed even if it's not perfect It's a really great idea got them into the habit of doing things Next thing is brush teeth So then my toddler goes and And brushes her teeth She has an electric electric toothbrush She tries to brush her teeth as best as possible. I do go in there now for every morning There are certain sections that she could still not get to I want to make sure she gets her teeth brushed properly But she's still doing it herself just hopping her a little bit get dressed It's the next next task. She does these in order and And this she does for herself the drawer is up to her level and she gets to pick out what she wants to wear for the day The next thing is cone here have a little basket full of different hair accessories Evermiche and a Romero and she after I take out of the knot over here She gets to do her own hair. She gets to put the accessories in her hair. She has to comb her hair the next thing is vitamins So I have little container vitamin right she just put one vitamin in there for her I put it in the kitchen at her beach and she can she knows that she's to take her gummy bear vitamins My youngest daughter also does it herself. I put it in her own little container when she gets to them too Here we have prayer and this is just a quick gratitude prayer Just saying thanks for the day for another morning for the health for the parents for her sisters and So I think that's important to sort of the day in a positive way If so these are the tasks that I have for my children. I am a stair home mom I am a stair home mom and I homeschool my children But if you are a mother and you work and you send your kids to childcare or you send your kids to school You can also integrate this board into your daily schedule into your daily living Just put different tasks up here that your children would do such as Get lunch bag ready a lunch box ready or maybe Make the back make their back packs get their back packs ready Make sure other books are in there other library books are in there Different things that your children would need to do in the morning Depending on what what they what that other and their kindergarten first grade Even beyond they couldn't continue using this board for older children as well Then we have night tasks So So before we head into bad these are things that we do first thing is clean table and then so we have a little table here my children and All the daughters to spray the table down with her vinegar water solution clean it up and put the take put the chairs up That's just I have that I got them gotten them into Because I I sweep the floor so I like the chairs up So then they go ahead and put a jewel Now my youngest daughter is not working on this board yet because she's still too young But I didn't want to add her on later because I took time doing this board So I decided to add her roughly the start so that six months later or something. I don't have to add her again So my other daughter goes ahead and put a jewel so she's already done that tonight. She cleaned the table pick up toys. She's to put her toys back My youngest one can actually help with that she does They are to put their toys back in the In this little category in this little table here and this is the box of where she keeps her toys And then I put this back into the closet and the next day she can pick another box All of her toys are divided into different boxes and categories and she got to pick a different box every day Or the same box if she wants to then she's to put it back here on the table and then I put it back into the closet and then tomorrow She picks a new box. She gets to go into the closet and pick her own box So she went ahead and she put a jewel here because she's done with that and right now they're really hanging out with their dad The next thing is going to happen is Bath Or wash it don't take a bath and I didn't have the moisture face and wash their hands Brush teeth one more time put pajamas on that she does by herself because it's at her beach and lastly prayer And then again, I have these little jewels and I got them at the craft store. I put some magnetic tape on the back You can use anything for girls. I got the jewels because they're girls and they love jewels, but you can use Pom-poms you can use anything you want Down here is what is happening today So this is what we do every day and this always changes So it's never the same this what we did today, but this is definitely different on a daily basis shelf work Which has the shelf activities that they do and That you can see in another video if you haven't seen my shelf work video Then we have a read aloud in the morning So I read them books Every morning and picked them up from the library usually every week I'm fried or something Today with this on flashcards Let my oldest go on the computer and the computer she can do different things such as Watch documentaries she can watch cartoons Whatever she's really interested in watching at the moment or playing with Then we have lunch After lunch is always silent time and for silent time they go into A session of the house was like a little reading corner and they stay there for about an hour and a half And they could choose to take a nap or they could choose to Recycling look through books play a board game, but they have to stay in there for that time Today we have some outside play another read aloud and then clean up clean up is usually Done at the end of the day before dinner Okay, and that is what we did today and I have all of the different things that we do That we can do that we can put up on the what's happening today section I can put library I can put dancing they love dancing so I put some music on and they start dancing sometimes for language This is a little board that we do a little board game There's a relatives free play they can help me cook All types of things they can do Bible playground They can play with their apps my oldest can play with her apps educational apps on the iPad to painting to have a few trip workbooks Gymnastics they got a gymnastics you can go on errands Science to play games bingo can others a lot other things that we could possibly do during here So Co-op we go to the co-ops and times So that is how we do it. I keep this in a little shoe box and I put it on top of my fridge and I I change it So every morning my oldest is looking excited to see what's happening today. She wants to know what's going to happen So she looks over here You have a lot of different a lot of children You miss me now work for you guys every child is doing different things. They're on different schedules But you can still do something what's happening in a different way when you can tell them this is going to the library or We're going to Field trip what you see something like that something simple And to make fun and to make it more engaging I changed this magnet out So for Valentine's Day for example, I can have hearts and I took these hearts stick these These stickers from the dollar store put some magnets on the back and they just make it fun I can change up the magnets They could put hearts instead You can use Little rocks I got these little rocks at the craft store You can use anything for the magnets. It's good to change them around by season if you can get them Christmas Easter ones just keeps them motivated different magnets something new So yes guys that is our schedule task board I hope it has been helpful You can definitely integrate this from multiple age groups and It has worked so wonderful for us I can tell you that it builds self-sufficiency it builds autonomy in children It builds self-confidence and it starts building organizational habits I know I see people complaining about their children when they're older My child is so lazy they get up and they don't do their beds They have a mess in their room, but these are the type of things that you have to store at an early age so that the habits are set so that the foundation is set And that's why it's important to Get children to the habit of doing their own things Never do something for a child that they can do for themselves Always empower your children. That's really important Well guys, I hope this has been helpful and I look forward for your comments and your replies For more videos like this, please subscribe. Thanks for watching
