 Alright so it's been all for about five minutes and I'm about to try to flip them. I'm not going to flip them because I've been scared of the grease. Don't get on me. So I'm going to flip it on to the one next to it. It's a real pretty. It'll be off the lathe and make up. Oh, I'm scared. I'm not scared. Alright so it is going to be easy. Lift. Master. Really bad. You're really good off from this way. I'm the lady so I'm going to give you a big hand. So that's how they're looking so far. Really pretty. Really well, so I feel more lazy. Why do you tell me to like this thing? I'm a kid. I'm a kid. Thank you. Why? So let them go ahead and cook on through. That's pretty much the end result of it. What you eat how cornbread with? How about cornbread with... You can see it all. That's what they're picking the ups. We eat how water cornbread with black appies and rice with some... beef short ribs, cabbage and whatever you want to eat with your cabbage. Green, all like this stuff. Kind of like a soul food dish. Green, macaroni and some turkey. Pretty much soul food. I don't eat too many beans. But that cornbread would be real good. And I feel like I made the best cornbread. My cornbread is better than anybody else's cornbread I've ever tasted. Even my mom was. Heres don't be sweet enough for me. But this is lady in my chart. She put peppers and herbs. But it's just gonna be... It's not sweet enough. Now what I'm gonna use to drain... Probably should have put it on a rat butt. You know what? Let me try that. Let's see if that works better. Normally I just put it on the pepper towel and in collo the day. Hey, baby. Okay, I can't get to that. That's so funny. I'll just put them on the pepper towel. See if they do. Hey, looking real pretty. But I guess I can let them click a little longer. I'm gonna put it on the pepper towel. I'm gonna put it on the pepper towel. See if they do. They look real pretty. But I guess I can let them click a little longer. But that's pretty much it. So if I learn how to edit videos and stuff, I'll tell some pictures at the end of the end result. But as of right now, I don't know how to do that. So that's pretty much it. And that's Nick Walker. So if you like it, just let me know. Try it out. Let me know what you think. And if you have your own way of making a Hollywood economy, you know, let's challenge it. Talk to you later. Bye.
