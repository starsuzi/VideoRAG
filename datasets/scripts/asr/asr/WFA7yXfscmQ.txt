 Another video a 6 fight Spoke Oh What's up YouTube it's boy sits here, and I'm gonna show you sick Six six sick build real quick Pretty much top DPS bill for the siren there she is right there with the admiral Admiral whatever Siren head I just got recently when I went ape shit with the shotgun on a bunch of robots Not sure exactly what the challenge was, but it's pretty sick there if you like it definitely look at one up Let me jump in here So like when I started off the game, you know, I was having fun. I was doing the Hold on This dumbass stop talking Because you're a dirty hippie Karras but you're stupid as bird Rollin Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's try that photo This is where I've seen we're probably gonna die It's time to get clapped trapped a thousand cuts. We need him to shut down the force field make it painful guys So anyways, yeah, like I started a game off doing the cataclysm build tearing it up having fun You know, but the one I started hard mode. I wanted like a survivability build not really for me But you know help out teammates And still you know have really good defense and do it good, but a DPS and that's when I kind of did like the chain Phase lock build that I already did on my last videos You know and that was none in the cataclysm basically and Well, I'm not gonna explain the build here, but you know, it's basically you're getting mad health You're killing them pretty quick in phase lock and it's jumping from one to a second one to a third one And then a lot of times like they'll drop out of the fourth and instantly see you can just about get like three phase locks So if you got a cool down room, I mean you will jump right back into a third one. I thought this was a really good build And I didn't really you know look any cataclysm too much because You know wasn't you know, it's not really that powerful or anything in the beginning But that's because you know, I didn't have points to put in it and then another thing is like my friend pointed out Something out it knows like when you use like a class mod and you put points and something I thought once they hit five points I'd say your maxed out well know as you can see It because I've seen that number before like let's say 9 out of 5 But you do get the extra damage it'll just keep ranking up like this should have been like 25 crit not 45 because I'm 9 out of 5 So that's something I also didn't know So really this build here is like something you won't really know of until you hit 50 you can get some shit off to our Morpheus mainly the class mod and and Basically what I'm gonna call this build is I'm gonna call this like you know them. I'm gonna call the max DPS shot gun build Can't really think of a better name for it now and nothing too clever when he could prop some of buddy creation He just cuz I haven't thought about it recently Well really I just turned 50 so I didn't even you know I didn't even you know I wasn't even trying to think about Making a new build yet, but you know he enlighten me on a few things like you can put in when you're 50 and You can just really make a really great build so let me show you gear first and then how that works with the build so we all know This game has like shitty SMG's in the sorry It takes so long to find a good a sorry for SMG. This is the best I've seen I guess this this came off. This is some of the I mean some of the best I've seen I think you want to tear Morpheus This is shotgun amusing right now. It's pretty dope If it had explosive damage it would just be Elite it'd be the best I think right now. I mean I'm critting for like 200 to 250k average and I popped a couple three hundred and 78 crits 378,000 Crits now recently when I did the band when I did a band at slaughter so that was pretty sick and if I would if I'd put a shield on with the amp damp Damage which I don't normally use, but if you're really trying to get that max DPS You know you can get even more And also my bad ass rank is only you know five thousand or something. You know, it's not huge And when I started the game out, you know, I did a few things you know thinking not thinking in the end for top DPS I was thinking and you know for the throughout the whole game So I don't have everything in gun damage everything and critical hit damage You know if I did I'd have even a little more damage, but 378K is pretty high You know, I don't see you getting like a whole lot, you know more than that or whatever so Here's the gear. Here's a shotty My shield is mostly mostly just a badass shield to you know You know Have my resistance up and have a lot of health and if I didn't use this one you guys should definitely Do the quick charge shields Terra Morphus will drop them. They're really fucking cool You know they have like a smaller capacity. It's about Half as much or whatever is like one of the like the better shields But the recharge delays like instant, you know, it's second and Then with your ward all the way up 40% I mean your recharge delay is like 0.8.7 so it's under a second and then if you look at the recharge rate It's fucking instant so you already understand how that works Got a sick grenade mod here 470,000 Most I've seen so far But as far as the build goes you need this Slayer Terra Morphus class body those skills right there. It's put into that's gonna allow you to Really work around your whole build because because of all those right there and like you really couldn't do that before So you know this build is definitely not viable not in just a level 50 But until you defeat Terra Morphus also And you'll get this but you know Well before Terra Morphus. This is what I Think you should use because the shotguns as you guys have seen you always find the highest weapons DPS to be like really good shoddies in the game and you always find a lot better shoddies than you ever do SMGs and sorry So this deputies badge is what's up right here. This is what you need to put on and With that reload speed me 48% and Your reload speed reduction in your badass ranks and your reload speed reduction in Your foresight you're just fucking in practically instantly loading so It's just ridiculous you're doing You know right here is 6000 times so you know 70 some thousand and Then instant reload and then that's not adding the crits or adding their 11% here. I mean it's it's ridiculous So let me show you the build a quick. We'll start with heart motion We're just you're just gonna start off with one in ward Now I know there's five but that's because the other four comes from the slayer of Terra Morphus mod so one in ward Five and it's celebrate and Like one of the reasons I didn't put I wasn't doing a celebrate when I first started to do my DPS build It's because I didn't plan on getting four more from a Terra Morphus build didn't kill him yet didn't know he dropped that mod and 27% is really nice, but without that extra four it's only in what like 18 or It's like 15% or something that didn't really matter like too too much to me But just put five in that you'll get four more from Terra Morphus Bullets speed plus 36% 27% gone damage. That's just really sick there Five in mines eye Which I think is 25 critical grade damage, but Terra Morphus mod gives you four more to make 45% critical hit 54% melee one in sweet release Because you're gonna get the four more from the mod so you still got your five so you're getting your health from when your phase lock and five in here for that massive damage Mouths of you know extra damage from when they're phase lock so when they're phase lock you're gonna you're gonna 30% here and another probably 30% here and then the bullet speed also adds to DPS so that's 50 and 36 here that's 86 I mean The multiplier is just crazy there and then just one more left just do the rest You know so you know you might not be doing a lot of regeneration for your buddies and this and that But everybody has builds where they can figure out how to stay alive So it shouldn't be up to you so just keep this to resum And it's awesome, and you can be a mile away and rest people. It's it's Put one in flicker. You'll get the other four from the mod And This way you know what you can start out as if you're 48 46 that way, you know You know, and then you'll get the rest you know when you get the mod and whatnot Put five in here There's even more you know there's a reload speed again before and here So you're doing 50% 40% extra damage while you're in fight for your life and This is this is the thing. This is like a max DPS build here, but So so let's say you know you're not doing a lot of the health things here But it's not as big of a deal, you know, we got something else going on here like the assassin how They do the melee and they go into fight for your life and I forgot how it works like if they lose all their health they do like Some crazy amount of damage and they want hit everything It's kind of like that for you like it's okay to go into fight for your life Because you know, you're just doing more damage in there and you'll jump right back out of it. So That's like another survivability type them Helios Actually causes a good-bited damage once your higher level and everything and when I first started doing these And I was like kind of chlism is not all that great, you know, but it is when your level 50 is the thing and It's gonna be the helios, you know, Chris a cloud whatever. It's still in corrosive damage. It's you know, it's all right It's nothing spectacular. Obviously that's good for bosses That ain't gonna mean a damn thing for just regular enemies because you're gonna one shot like everything Killing an enemy caused you to deal constant fire and corrosive damage Blade Phoenix is sick. It looks real sick to it puts the big fire rings on the back Blade Phoenix You deal constant fire and corrosive damage for sure time you actually deal shit ton of damage and that and I knew you're gonna gain Damage because it says the damage is based on your level and the level of blade Phoenix Why didn't realize when you hit level 50 how much damage you do with this it is a lot So my survivability build I'm all I'm all for it I basically, you know put some points in here. It looks just like this pretty much You know except I have someone here and here and then finish off and here like four points And I think a mod gives something to me in there, but then I do you know this this One in here and then five and five that's my survivability kind of class and you go from phase lock to phase lock and Shit ton of hell is coming out and you're still doing decent DPS But you ain't dropping at 370 370 K hits Headshots like you are with this build So this shotgun max DPS build is just It's just the fucking cock diesel That's my fucking boy, whoever would say oh man he cracks me the fuck up, dude So I don't know dude try this shit out I know price on Ridiculous right now. I like being in it but This this skill tree build here is just really really good You'll be dropping to 250 K hits constantly hitting 350 to 400 K hits here and there too and You'll do even more if you throw on the shield that does the amp damage for that first shot after your shield We're completely drained It's just one shot, but still it's all about seeing how high you can get one shot You know, that's what we all strive for you know who can get the top DPS You know, I think right now just playing tonight it was 378 K for me And then all you know obviously if you did your badass rank right if you saved them up and then you put them all in like gun damage Crit will hit damage fire rate reload speed those are the four I'm talking about Maybe critical hit chance to if you did that towards the very end Well, no, you don't eat the right elemental chance though. I'm just a crit damage Reload speed gun and gun damage if you did all that you know at the end that's gonna be a Little bit more damage maybe you'll do another 50k for crit or some I'm not sure But you the science definitely got every ability to hit half a million crit shots for sure So and you ain't gonna do it without this build and a really good shotgun and put on deputy's badge So if you got any opinions or you figured anything out leave me a comment below You know, I won't criticize you if you put something real stupid up. I just won't reply But you know, I'm not gonna criticize you though. I will take I'll take all comments and consideration You know with what you think and whatnot and And yeah, it's about it comment like subscribe if this helps you out But um, you're gonna be a badass if you were running with a gun zerker and he was going gun zerker with fucking shotguns And he was just tearing shit up you know and and the fucking assassins one shot and everything with their melee build and you're in a back Toss and heals out no one's giving you credit for the damage you do Yeah, come back in the next day with this build and just fucking put the gun zerker and assassin the fucking shame shame I'll catch you guys later. Oh and one more thing with this build you'll be able to fucking Kill Tara Morpheus and like four or five hits man. I think my buddy got him down it took half his health and like one hit I don't know dude. Those are ridiculous So there really is nothing better than this build in those mods and relics All right, I'll catch you guys later.
