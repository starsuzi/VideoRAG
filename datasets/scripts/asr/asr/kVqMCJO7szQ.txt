 I'm Gene from Six Flags and we all know the Six Flags experience is about those thrilling rides and creating memories that last a lifetime. But you can't forget about all the great food options we have here at the park. And if you're a seasoned past holder, I have the best offer for you. It's the all-season dining pass. Now there are three types of passes. The basic pass, the deluxe pass, but here's what you're going to want to get. The gold all-season dining pass. Here's why. You get lunch, dinner, and a snack every time you visit the park. You get a souvenir sports bottle with unlimited refills. You can diet at any Six Flags park and you even get 20% off most retail purchases. So I caught up with some families here in the park to find out why they think it's the best value to get that gold all-season dining pass. With the value and the variety that you get here, Six Flags. I'd love to help the options. We're going to have a chicken salad and a pizza tonight. Well, they have a sports bottle and my kids love unlimited drinks. It's perfect. I love the sandwiches. My kids love the snacks. The pretzels are incredible. And salads are awesome. It's one of the best, best greatest toys I've made for this year. What an incredible deal. And here's the best news. The gold all-season dining pass pays for itself in just three visits to the park.
