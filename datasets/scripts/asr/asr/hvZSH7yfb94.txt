 Hello, I'm Shannon and I'm just going to have a little bubble with fogum. So all I'm going to do is bubble gum. And you might question my wearing stress. I was trying out my dress bear at Colonial Day at school. Anyways, I'll back in bubble gum. There is no fly out with your tongue and the roofie mouth like this. So I had that. Rub around your tongue with the seagulls. Rub around your tongue with this. Then bite down with this and have a look like this. Where are you? I don't know. How dare you leave without leaving me to eat. I can't do food. I'm scared. I can't do food. I'll put my stuff with my upstairs. So I was just there. I got 100 dollar bill. JK the phone case, so not called the case. So I'm going to have gum things. And I will talk to you next video. Bye.
