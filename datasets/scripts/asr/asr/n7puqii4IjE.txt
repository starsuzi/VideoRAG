Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel and my hair are feeling so dry, unmanageable, oily, lamb like I have all the problem with my hair and I need to go for a party. What to do I think I'll have to sit back home grab a beer. Wait, I can use this beer on my hair for better results. So let's get started. First I'll pour the beer in glass container and let it stay overnight so that it gets flat and decarbonated. After overnight it will look like this totally decarbonated and now it's ready to use. So we will start with washing our hair with any regular shampoo, any shampoo that you use. Simply wash your hair with that and then rinse off all the shampoo and then it will be the time to put the beer on your hair. I'll put this beer, this is the two-bark strong beer that I am using right now. You can use any beer and now but don't go for any flavoured, go for a normal beer, put it all over your hair and scalp and then massage gently for just two to three minutes and you know the total time should not exceed five minutes. Be a should stay maximum for five minutes in your hair and after massaging it nicely you will have to rinse it off with water and after rinsing off of water skip the conditioner, don't condition because that work will be done by beer, let your hair dry nicely and then oh my god you can see the results. My hair are looking so much better fluffy smooth, you know the volume of my hair increased after doing this I noticed that but don't overdo this just once or twice a month is enough sufficient not more than that else your hair will get rough and you know bushy. So I hope you really like this go try this out and tell me how does it feel how your hair feel mine feel very good I hope you guys like that until next time bye take care keep liking keep watching subscribe to my channel thank you so much
