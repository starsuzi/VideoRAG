 Hi, this is Josh, a Chris the Carpenter in Cochlear, it's an Inwood Florida and I'm just gonna show you a quick spotting tip Use around your house, use your everyday household items, most people just keep lying around It's a good tip for most wall-to-wall carpeting in your house You don't want to use this on wool rugs or any kind of natural fibers you have like a you know A juke or anything like that. All right, so what we've got here We've got just a little bit of coffee, you know, it's still really hot. Just made it You know, it's a shame to do this but go walking around and you just spill a little bit here and there You know, and that's not even a lot most people You know you drop the whole cup or whatever it is and what we're gonna use is a little bit of distilled white vinegar It's a normal household 3% hydrogen peroxide you mix them up 50 50 half and half Inside of a spray bottle you don't want to mix too much Just what you think you're gonna use because it's not gonna last you very long You can't mix it put it on the shelf and use it two months from now First thing you want to do is grab a plain white clean towel and Try to blow it up as much as you can just without adding anything to it You know, you see how much just came out just just starting, you know Just try to put it up towel down Press down on you can use paper towels too if you don't want to use a kitchen towel or a bathroom towel It worked just fine. You just had to use a lot of them Keep on going till you think you got most of it that's gonna come up into the towel Right off the bat All right, then take a spray bottle. You just want to use a little bit. You don't want to soak this You know, you don't want to put too much on it just drives it further in you're not rinsing it off like you rent soap out of a car You know when you wash your car You just keep on blotting Add a little bit as you need to You Comes up pretty easily time is another factor. You don't want to let it sit for three weeks and then try this it gets a lot harder to do All right There we go. I think that was pretty simple Come pretty good All right, but you're not done see This works out pretty well, but then what you don't see is most of that Goes right through your carpets. It'll soak up some and hold it the rest of it goes into the backing down to the pad You know, and you can't reach that you can't lift up your rugs and see this So what you want to do when you think you're all done Still a little bit damp just put down either a stack of paper towels or a clean dried towel Put something heavy on top of it. Leave it sit overnight and a lot of that that's in the backing and Be these will wake up and come into this towel So you don't get a recurring stain all the time You might have to do this a couple of times it doesn't work out for you can always call us we pick a carpet clean as crystal guaranteed
