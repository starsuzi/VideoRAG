 Is there such thing as a cult classic toaster oven? The answer is yes. This is the Panasonic Flash Express Toaster oven. It's so quirky, and yet people who own it have the type of gripping obsession you don't often see for a kitchen appliance. I am in love with the warm glow of this little fella when on. Yes, toaster scent slice bread. Happy. Yes, I've actually made hard boiled eggs in this successfully. It's this cheery little box. Who would think that actually making toaster warming a pop tart? Or warming a pop tart could bring so much excitement. The secret to the Flash Express's enthusiastic fan base is the unique way it cooks food. Most toaster ovens rely on heating elements. This one, it cooks your food using a powerful light. No, not that oven with a light. Inferred light means this oven preheats fast. High-and-sawnaz and space heaters use the same technology, and the way it works on the Flash Express is similar. The light heats the quartz and ceramic elements to get high, consistent temperatures without much waiting. Roasted vegetables, some mores, and grilled cheese take no time at all. They cook evenly, crisp, beautifully, and because of that infrared, there's no lingering smell afterward. Also, that light, it kind of draws you in, and here I am staring at it just to get this shot. Of course I got a headache. Anyway, this thing is weird. It's a temperature control that looks like a radio dial, the timer that stops at 25 minutes. The cord comes out of the side, kind of a bad design. And finally, it has that very specific hash brown button. Eventually a new version will come along with more useful buttons or a modern design that fits in with the rest of your kitchen. And even if a sequel does arrive, you can bet we'll still be loving the original.
