 Okay, let's look at another simple vinaigrette. This is actually a really good staple. This is a French derived dressing from my understanding and it comes from my good friend Terry Shanahan. So we're making a ball-samic vinaigrette, really straightforward. Again, we're going to use about two to three parts olive oil to one part vinaigrette, depending on how much I'm kind of kick you one. So again, I'm not really measuring stuff though, but we can eyeball it and I'm using a mason jar again, which again as I've mentioned is probably the easiest way to make your dressings because you can just shake everything up. It's so convenient. So I'm just going to make a small batch. So I'm going to do, let's call that, that's 50 milliliters of olive oil. So we'll do about 20 of ball-samic. And this is actually a really interesting ball-samic. It's not black, but it's actually ball-samic vinegar. So it's not too sure how this all works out. Interesting. So next we're going to put in some lemon juice. So I'll put about a quarter of this, I'm not going to squeeze the whole thing in. So that's good. And then Dijon mustard. So this is going to add a little bit of a kick. And you can put in, or you should probably just shake it up first. Or normally if it's in a little jar with, that doesn't have to spill at this, you just kind of scoop it in. And if you want a little kick, you can add a little bit more. And as always, salt, pepper, it's a sin if you don't have that stuff in. I guess you just got to do it. So even if you're making a small batch for one salad, you can just use a mason jar anyways. And this one comes out as kind of like a creamy, yellow type of finish based on the Dijon that's used in there. And it's got a nice kind of like acid-y heat that's not too overpowering. And it's a really very common dressing vinaigrette used in France. So there we go. There is our ball-samic vinaigrette. It put it on any kind of salad you like. And it's as easy as that. Enjoy.
