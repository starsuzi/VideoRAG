 This is Chef Remi for cooking on oneonone.com. Today's recipe we're going to do a coconut milk hopper. Today's ingredients are coconut milk, sesame oil, and we've got our hopper mix, which is 3 cups of rice, soaked in water for 3 hours, and then ground up with coconut milk. Or you can go to the local store and get yourself hopper mix. You can start off with a little pan here that we're using to do our hoppers. It's round, you can either walk or you've got a pan like this. Let's take them out and teach food and send to me on top. Just put that in there. Make sure you get it all around the sides because you don't want this sticking to the sides. Okay, and you're going to take your hopper mix. Pour that in, and again the same thing you just want to kind of go around the sides here. And get that shape. As you can see there, keep going around and let it cook itself to the sides. And then you're going to take your coconut milk, pour a little bit in there, and then you're going to put a teaspoon. Then you can put the lid on that and let that cook for about 2-3 minutes. So it's been about 3-4 minutes now and we're looking to see because the sesame oil is not sticking. And then we're just going to take that, put that right there. There you have it. That is your coconut milk, hopper. Well that's our recipe for today and if you have any questions, concerns you can visit the website. And thanks for watching and I'll see you next recipe. You
