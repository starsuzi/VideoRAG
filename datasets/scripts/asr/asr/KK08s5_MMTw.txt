 Okay, so here I've got my red onion. I'm just gonna go ahead and clean this up a little bit. You know, red onions, sometimes called Spanish onions. I'm gonna go ahead and clean the outside or peel the outside just like I do any onion over top and the bottom off. Sometimes the first layer is not too nice on these red onions, but this one looks okay. Especially because we're gonna cook it down. And any blemishes will be hidden. I'm gonna go ahead and take out the core with that V-cut and then just julienne the onion. When you get down to the end there, just flip it over, keep going. And then we've got these long restrains. I'm gonna go ahead and finish off the other side. And then we've got the red onion. And then we've got the red onion. And then we've got the red onion. And then we've got the red onion. And then we've got the red onion.
