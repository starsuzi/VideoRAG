 Welcome to Sunday Night Shooters! I'm your host Eric Sorghaw here, Ian. I go with you here, Doug. And we're making a shooter. We're kind of, we're, we're, when someone did this column, it's called the sour duck fart. Which sounds awesome. Hey. Well... What are you duck-ticks? Hey, we're back at this again. Oh. The, the duck fart is a cocktail already. We've done this. It's one of our higher-hit cock-ticks. Actually, it should treat like a little more watery. Yeah. More shardy. Yeah. Yeah. Because birds, they should hardly go on more bubbles. They lose more than that. They lose all of my... It was like, seriously, when the, like, the ducks pettling... ...in the water, and in, in pitchfarts, it like... That's a wet pain right there. There's... I... Give me a lot of thought to this. I, um, show... Hello. ...some of the ass-o. The duck fart, I can't remember the exact... Oh, is, is Canadian whiskey... The duck fart? And, um, Bailey's... I think that's it. This one is, it's got sour mash. It's got, um, uh, Jack Daniels, old number seven Tennessee sour mash whiskey. Sour duck fart. Sour duck fart. So basically, all you're doing is you're taking Canadian whiskey out, and you're putting American whiskey in. Hmm. Hmm. From, from the Tennessee region, we can have that argument again, um, of where that's made, but let's not do that, unless... With you? I don't like that. No. No, it's not. How about you pour some Bailies, and if you run out... Where are you on? We, one ounce, right? Yep. We're gonna do one ounce. You're gonna do one third of ounce, but we have four glasses, so we're gonna do one ounce. If you run out of that, or if it comes out chunky... We get this one. I'm so happy. Sometimes that happens. I have to come out chunky, that might be okay. And if that one doesn't work, I've got another one here. So you just let me know. No chunks. No chunks. Um, I obviously refrigerate them after opening. It's cool enough down here. Yeah, that's it. Yes. Double loves me. Um. So, give it that. We have so many bottles of Bailies. It's just because we have this show on the internet. Maybe you've heard of it. It's called calm and cocktails, and people like to send us down. They like the free publications and press. I like the fact that I have material to build cocktails from. And sometimes I guess, lots of shizziness. This is an honest, honest, honest, honest, honest, honest, honest. Four? Yeah. Oh yeah, we're gonna add ice. Oh, Texel. All right, shake it straight. The other one's layered, by the way, evolution. Shake it, babe. I say, believe, because I can't remember. I'm just gonna take this big thing out. You in it. So we got the mermaid. What's the daily thing? I'm sure that exists. It's probably the same thing. Peach nops and. No, mermaiding. But what's jelly fishing? What a thing. When the fish is not in the industry. No. Jelly fishing is getting a lot of my hair. You're getting a lot of my hair. Meow. Meow. You love me, Alan. You love me. You love me. You love me. This is a CPR method. They actually didn't feel good. I'm CPRing you. Oh, is that what you're doing? Yeah. You're sitting in your life. You just don't know it. Why eat the thumb thing? It's like what I did with the, with the, with the leaning sharks glasses. From Awesome Drinks.com. So I'll later like that. Those leaning shark glasses from AwesomeDrinks.com. That was really cool. I'll lean to this way that way. So it looks kind of like, like an engine with like a V. Like the V6. Or it's a V4. Or 12. But they can also test those things to poke out of the engine. But they call those things. Engines. Chevrolet's. This, you know what? You're going to be the slowest bartender again. I don't know how much is in here. All of it. You don't have plenty in there. Do I have enough? I don't know. Okay. If you don't have enough, we'll just give Douglas. Cause God knows he doesn't need it. Damn. Oh, that's the joke. That was it. That's like, that was good. I don't know. So even these are. You actually look tasty. By now, all the patrons would have left. Question today. What is your favorite, Bailey's infused cocktail or shot? Bailey's infused cocktail? I always say I was cream infused. What are we infusing it with? You mean one that just has the ingredients in it? I think that's what they mean. Yeah. Brain. Bailey shot? Brain. Brain. Brain. Brain. So I feel that. I feel that. Brain. Brain. Brain. Brain. Brain. Brain. I feel like I don't want to move these cause you were arranged nicely. Really? You could just take one and drink it. Oh, you want to hand them out? Well, I mean, they were right here. But you have five people. Why do I only have four shots? That's a good club. You did it wrong. That's a good club. Let's start over. What are you doing? I'm going to drink out of this. I'm going to share one of these with the back roof. We're shot forever. So since we start on that one, I apparently miss and this one's got like Doug's freaking line hanging there. He's like building another one by sharing this. This is like Obamacare here. Where's he going? He's already been me. He was just doing a fucking shot. This is crazy. This creates pre-existing conditions. Yes. I'm the creator and he's usually pre-initious. Stop thinking and drink. Gross. Oh, gross. What? Shinshin. Where's he? He did the pros. That never happens. Shinshin. Let's throw up yet. That's a new one. Just let's pros this shit up. That's a belt. What I thought was going to take really good. That is really good. Chocolate in the finish. Yeah, the the Jack Daniels had something to it. Yeah, that one. In the beginning. Really? I'm not getting JD hitting me at all. Really? I taste his jacket. I taste his jacket. I taste his jacket. I don't know how to scream in the glue. It helps keep the cream from the baleys and the sweetness from the clueless from being overpowering. You mean just sweet? Two sweets, yeah. It's like a mo... Yeah, it's like a cappuccino meets a mudslide and then goes right down. And that means a big red that you were chewing earlier in the day. So you were chewing on the big red and then... I'm not getting any big red. It's pretty red. That's the cinnamon that you're getting. Oh, that's not a nickname for somebody. Are you getting cinnamon? Yeah, you're getting cinnamon. Getting cinnamon. Cinnamon. I don't get cinnamon. It's fucking cinnamon, goddammit. All right, dicky, look. I don't get cinnamon in here at all. I get chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate! Chocolate! Cinnamon. Is it a swindler? It makes you live longer. Cinnamon makes you live longer? Jinks, cocoa and busting. No, chocolate. My turn? It's a coating. We're trying. You have to get me a coat out of my fridge. That's pokey, oasis. Well, what's hidden? Punch funny. Yeah, punch funny. Well, next time we have a... Punch-funky baleys. Baleys. Oh, ninja. That's a jellyfish. I like how he laughs and he's using a girl. I inch-bow equally, actually. He probably won't let me end my bow this way. I am ashamed. It's fine. This red, by the way, is submitted by... Oh, look what you did to him. Oh, bullshit, I didn't hit him there. That's what I did. Right there. That's my... That's what bad, that's there, it is right there. Yeah, maybe. You were doing weird things in the elbow. That's a pre-existing condition. You're going to explain the... Your carbon-edder robot. That's why I need an Obamacare. It's a pre-funky, existing division. What type of condition is that? Like, I read... You know what it looks like? You were running... This happens to Doug. He's weird this way. You were running straight while drunk and you ran away... He didn't know how to pull. It could've... All I out could've been in your closet and it was like a coat hanger pull. Like, he didn't read it sideways. You do weird stuff like that. You have a fake closet? They could've... Might've been a 40-foot aluminum... Pull. Pull. See? I'm on my own. I'm on my own. I'm on my own. I'm on my own. I'm on my own. I'm on my own. That like... Yeah, it said... It lands. Gravity. Physics. It's scaffolding. Okay. It's scaffolding. He was drinking? Was it moving or are you? And now it was like... It was like... You know, taking it down and like... Like, it was just... It was like... This is probably gonna fall on the ground. I didn't do it. It's like quicker than... I... I expected. That's how it just... It's a good bruise though. Yeah, I'll make sure I hit you again later on that one. It's a Mally bruise dog. It's always good to have Mally bruises. Yeah. Those little bruises aren't... Yeah. Carry pizza. She did. He got out of the line. He got out of the city. Honestly, it was my wife. My wife beat the shit out of her. Don't get out of the line again. That's what he did. She misplaced it. I'm gonna do it again to I've seen her out. No, here's what happened. She said something about his shit. It was way wrong. She was not let off. She misplaced her phone books. So she was like, Well, I can't beat you in the back today. And she was like, Well, I'm just... How can I make this look like a... Work... Existing condition. Related bruises. And I was like, well, I was... You can't throw it out. I was taking down the... You can rip off my arm. Little jacks and like... There's a story. Come down on this shoulder and she was like, Really? And then she... No, it's gone. On top of me, she was an animal and she was like, Bring him, bring him. Oh, no, she did. You're like, That motherfucker. She dragged his... She dragged his... She was unbelievable. She was so loud. No, she's not. I really hope this gets edited out, but it won't. Oh, no. Anyway, thank you, Agent Plus One. No, it was good. Okay, Agent Plus One, which the original submitter on, I think, Garnesbury. And then Gary submitted it by Lincoln. You guys are. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks, Gary. Let's taste it. That is her... Awesome. We can do a couple of... Sour Duck part. Your next... And next shooter has to be the sour duck part. Because it tastes like... Eeple parts, Klua. I really like the taste. Can you do the sour duck chart? No. You know what's in there? Your chocolate chocolate cow. We know how he likes his crem make a cake. Maybe some chocolate shavings. Thank you. Right on the top. I'm already looking forward to it. Oh, maybe it's just... If you've seen birch it. It's just an egg white that you float on. No, no, no. It's birch. No, it's shit egg white. It's fucking chocolate jimmies. It's not like... Chocolate jimmies. Chocolate jimmies just like float it on. Why wouldn't you just use whipped cream? Or maybe some green macaroni. You ever seen Canadian geese? All right. Oh, no. There's a line. We long jumped it. No, we don't even make a line in the show. I'm a habitual line. We snort those lines. Anyway. We snort them. We pee on them. And then we long jump them. That's right. That's a big deal. Every day drinkers don't. We belong to all the lines. We belong to them. If you're into lazy chocolate glasses, you know where to go people. Awesome drinks don't. Oh, you're right. Everydaydrinks.com. He's all like, everyday drinkers. AKA ED. Not the type of v-ag... That goes with that. The background. It will get it out. No, the kinds that have to deal with erections. Right. No erections. No people talk about boners all the time. Euregney sounds as functions. Not in a minute. Because I talk about boners all the time. We know. Because we need to have something to do with it. But again. Got it. Which... We're teaching. That's a three-boner shot. I guess we have to start it. Ah, yeah, I see. Hey, man, what's up with the Sarah Duckford? It looks like a duck. Oh, no, yeah. No, not the voice. The random... The random assortment of sounds later. Three. Three. We wish you'd like to start it. I'm sorry. Three. We wish you'd start reading my butter. It's what I said. Oh, why? What you said there? Remember when Drink was three boners? That was a three-peneless drink. I said it. I said it. How many penises are you bringing? Is that peanut? How many samples? How many samples? How many samples? I said, oh, I'm going to the link. I said, oh, check this out. And then I go to the link. At work. I'm browsing through the Wikipedia, the dictionary.com, fucking penis definition. And my computer fucking decided to freeze up on IE. So, I have this antomical picture of a penis. I'm dictionary.com. I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is on this... What window can I launch to cover this? So, the people walking by, you know, a penis on my computer. Oh, nothing's better than... Hey, how's it going? It's just grand. Nothing. Nothing. It would be better. It would be better to... Somebody walks in rather than doing that. How's your name? How are you doing? And then look at your computer and you go, yeah, I get jokish. I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it? I'm just sitting there like, fuck, what is it?
