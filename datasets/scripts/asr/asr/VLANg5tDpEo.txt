 Okay garage renewal painting and epoxy floor update for the west side of the garage is now fully painted on all new outlets coverage are put on so that was the hole over there and that's all nice and sealed up so okay tomorrow morning the epoxy crew comes so we can put it to that okay the crew has been here for about six hours now and they're using these floor grinders and they've produced about 200 pounds of cement dust so you suck it up into a couple of acuums and they use these heavy industrial grinders surface grinders and what they do is they essentially grind off the cream coat on the cement and a little bit more and they get down to the aggregate a little bit so you'll start seeing some of the some of the more aggregate bits and then they get up to the edges real close grinding with these hand grinders which have these diamond diamond surfaces on them and so this is a treatment where they actually don't ask for what they grind off the surface which gives a better treatment for the floor and this is the part A and part B epoxy coating that they're putting down I'm getting beige and here are some cracks that they're going to grind out and then fill with some leveling compound so they've done a crack treatment we have these relief cracks and they've they're putting in a well they pour in this industrial sand to fill the deeper cracks and then they put in this foam stuff and then they cover that with some a lot of cocking to hold down these foam tubes in the crack and then a little sand over that to weld cures self-love-wing sealant and that will stay flexible and so the so the expansion joints can still flex a little and they're apparently the epoxy can float over that without damaging it but it's all gonna look like this so that when I'm welding and doing woodwork I don't have all these cracks full of junk to have to dig out they came back today for about four hours to do some deeper crack sealing over here and a little bit there and a little bit here they're gonna come by tomorrow once it's all hardened and regrined all this so it's nice and smooth okay they were back this morning for a little bit they've cleaned up some of these the cracks and we ground a few spots that were curing over the night so that those cracks are good and they've double-checked and really made sure that this fill compound this self-loveling compound has has set up real good and has a little sand on it that's basically glued into it so that the primer will stick to it really good this is a bit of an oil spot they went to go they actually went to get some some chemicals that will extract any last little bit of oil out of that spot because they did get as much ground out as possible and they just want to make sure that there's no oils coming out of there that would gas and then cause bubbling or cracking and they put down the primer coat they'll be back later tonight to put down the epoxy and they have finished the job it's been about a week what you see here is they came in and they put two coats of the epoxy down it's a beige epoxy and then to protect that they put down two coats of urethane which is a two-part compound that mixes up and goes down as a clear coat kind of like what you put on an automotive car and it took four days to do that because there was a day for each coat of epoxy and a day for each coat of the urethane and so it took one of the week to finish this job but it looks really really nice nice nice deep color to it the urethane coat might get scratched but that's just a because it's a clear coat you just buff it out if you really want to look nice again in four or five years you just you just put another coated urethane down and hands that protects the the beige epoxy but that's it that's the final update for the painting of the garage and epoxying of the floor worked out really really nice I'm quite satisfied with it thanks for joining thumbs up
