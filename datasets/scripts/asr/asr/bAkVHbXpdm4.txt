 This is how the musicians say, oh my goodness, a child's sausage. Oh God, both the listeners. So, but I'm putting some ragged sauce in the bottom of the pan. And then we know that the sausage is already cooked and we've steered it. So we're going to put this in here. I've got to hurry up by the fire detector all. And then we just fear this a little more and that's why there was going to be an echo thing to get that much heat. But we're going to put all of them in there. Look at them like this crack on the squirt and see the risk. And this is Italian sausage, okay? And we're trying to figure out what I'm going to do with the turkey burgers tomorrow. What you think I should do with them? Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to sprinkle the spaghetti. I'm going to chop it like this. And then I'll probably make some more too, because I know that the family will probably eat more than this. And then put some more. Now I'm going to pour a little bit. I always keep spring water near the stove because I use it for everything so that I don't have to use the water from the water from the sink. So, I love to cook for my family. So, I'm going to shake this up. Red goo is my favorite. I don't use every sauce. Sometimes I use progressive. And then there's a sauce. I think it's hunts that they sell in the Dollar Tree. I use that sometimes too, because you can do miracles with that stuff. I don't know what it is, but so I'm going to put this in the oven on warm. Okay? And I'm going to just let it cook. Okay? We have the ragu sauce, the Italian sausage, the spaghetti, and the seasoning I put basil, a ragu, a little garlic, and some other seasoning in there as well. But we're going to bake this slow in the oven, and we'll give you an update. But underneath all that, those noodles and sauce is the Italian sausage. Okay? Looking good! You
