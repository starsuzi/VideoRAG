 Music Dear Rebecca, did you see the sky in all its majesty? I can't decide the summer Every time the daylight ends I think of how you cherubize the sun The staring sun in the memory Music The days drag on the time it flies The absence only magnifies the change It's beautiful and tragic And every time I see your face I'll love you, that's been replaced in it And stop bubble magic Music Please forgive me and understand It wasn't you who pushed my hand away I was guilty, I accepted So tonight beneath the painted sky I think about your cherubize in all The lone bud still connected Music Please understand That I'm just a man And broken and I lost my hand Please believe me when I see I love you I love you
