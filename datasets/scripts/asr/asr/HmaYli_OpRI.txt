 I'm gonna videotape doing some sausage making right here. The crime is cutting out. What is that? A pork shoulder? As a pork shoulder. So we're gonna show you how to make Italian sausage right here. We got the pieces of meat. Right over here you got the grinder. The grind to cheese and the meat. Salt. Actually, no, I'll just have some red pepper. Yeah, you want a coffee? No, I'm good. I usually have it like, cause... And some black pepper. I usually have it like, later on. Partially to a clock, personal. It's a red wine. You got the cheese. And of course the meat itself and those are the casings right there. You're trying to do on that meat? Cut the bone out? Or no, that one's already done, you said, right? Yeah, they're both done. Just cutting the trim in the fat. Too much fat. Not too much. Not too much. Put this on your forehead. Yeah, it'll suck. You're nice facial. Nice pork fat facial for you. It's good. Slap it right on your forehead. It's good for the skin. So once we get that meat all cut, we're going to cut it in small chunks or small slices. Is what you're going to do? Yeah, so I can get it through the grinder. Just want to try and get it into this crap. Put it in the grinder right there. Grind it all out. That's the best part right there. Look. My experience is not too bad. Once you get to the back end, that's where all the fat is. How big do you make those chunks? Just enough to go through the grinder, not huge. In case you hear me slapping something, it's a bee. It's pretty viable. Pretty viable, so this will go right through. Oh, they're trying to go. And dry our sheets to keep the bees away maybe. So just chugging away here, or times chugging away. That looks good. All that good meat coming out of there. I think my uncle Eddie for this grinder. Wait, yeah? Yep, this is Uncle Eddie's grinder. My grandfather's brother. Thank you, Uncle Eddie. That's the last of it. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. We got that. Let's go then go into those. And then I guess the next step is just to push it through the... Mix it all together and then put it through the stuffer. So this is what it looks like once it's been ground. We're going to mix it with the cheese. So we're cutting up the parsley, putting it all in there. More fennel. I guess fennel is more to taste than anything I guess, right? Yeah. Joe's on bee patrol over here. He's over here trying to kill bees. Black pepper. What a shock. What a pound of salt. Good professional sauces make over here. It's a little bit of crushed red pepper. Just a little. We don't want to go crazy. Depends on how hot you want it. And to top it off. Just a little bit of wine. Now we got to mix everything together. Mix it all into one bowl. We've got cheese on the bottom of the other bowl. And that's going to have to all mix together with this. Wine, cheese, parsley, fennel, pepper, all together. Wine's turning it nice and purple. Notice that. You got to do this in a bathtub. Just get it nice and mixed. So you're happy with the. That everything's been distributed distributed equally and all that goodness. You're distributed. Next step. Off to the casing center. So you use a smaller one. Okay now what do you got, Karen? What is this here? Explain the perfect. We got it. We bought a funnel at one of the retail stores at Gander Mountain. How much it cost you? 30 bucks. Stainless steel. That was $30 for that. Are they all the same size? No, they're smaller. No, they all. That funnel. No, it looks like that. It goes on to here. They're all the same width though. So that you can push that sausage through and you put the casing on here. Enough for what we need. That's basically what, pig and testing? Sheep. Sheep and testens. That's what the sausage will believe. That's not what it is. I don't know what it is. It says hog casing. That's hog, yeah. It's not hog. Insult? Yep. Okay so you just put the casing on the end of the funnel there. And that's one continuous strip there. Right. You can get it on. Nice and easy. Eric goes. This is no joke. And you actually have to put that whole length onto the, or eventually you can cut it, right? You can cut it. Oh, you can cut it anywhere you want. But you'll put the, you'll finish. You'll try to make it as long as you can. Right, you'll fit as much as you can onto this funnel. And you're going to, you're going to, you're going to stuff it all under this. There it is. That's the end of that one. Okay so there was an actual break in that, right? Yes. So you see how it's kind of all bunched up on the end there? This tray is perfect for that. Now let's see if we can do this. I'm going to put it all down to a tray. You need a stick. Push it in. All right, good to do by hand. Now let's see how it does by hand first. So you're actually going to force it through the grinder. That's coming through. We'll see what happens. I'm going to have to get out of the way because you're going to have to stand on this area. And actually it's going to start coming out this end. I should have tied it in the little bit. Oh, it'll stay. Look at that. Two man operation. One guy forces it through. So it's a nice consistent stream. Oh, meat into the casing. There you go. That's a sausage right there. That's good. That's going to taste excellent. It's got this. Garbage here. Nice coming on. Nice little curl. Gabe is going to want to see this. There. I haven't done this in 18 years. So we cooked that all like that or do we twist it? Twist it off and break it like in chunks. Every one. Your hand is like a cup there. Stick it in. Push it down. It makes it a lot easier to just push that. I just invented it. Get it toward the end. I never want to buy sausage again. Well, like they say, two things you don't want to see being made. Maws and sausage. Make your sausage. There you go. There it is right there. That looks good. Getting ready for the grill. The best part of... Here's the best sound right here. Yeah. There's a good sound right here. Yeah. There. Look at that. That's the good sound right here. Got a little bit of extra pieces here. I'm going to make a couple little sausage patties. Alright. All on this. We go with that. Okay. So some of the leftover pieces that we didn't have enough casing for. We just made patties. Now we're going to watch it cook. Did a nice job making this. Yeah. I was just saying, you did a really nice job making this. Yeah, I did. Really did. It came really good. Look at that. There you go. I'm going to put some done sausages right there. There you go. We're making sausages. You're a bare hand. It's like a crop for us. I said I'd come in here. A health inspector. Alright, Gabe. Health inspector. We need a knife. Somebody... Please get the store. We're feeling that they're casing in my hands. I was like, it's like 20 years ago. Yeah, we cooked it. It's so weird. Perfectly just doing it. Come on guys. Get up. Yeah. Yo, this is a... This is the best idea right here. Yo. It's a great idea. It's flying here. A little bit of sausage. How do you like it? Oh good. Save the gas. So, let's have a final seat in here. Some pepper. Parsley. Parsley. Wine. He says really. He says you can take a look at that. Oh, check it at 160. How's that taste, guys? Okay, so why? You're good. There's your finished product of sausage. Cooked. 30 and a bun or a plain. I forget. What's to you?
