 Yo yo yo, this is Cinderella so what's up? Today I'm going to show you how to make the straps on a dress or shirt shorter So the first thing you want to do is cut the straps at the back So I'm just going to take a good pair of fabric scissors and cut the strap Just like that and I'm going to do it on both sides So just be careful not to cut the dress Now you want to figure out how much strap you want to take off So I'm going to take off about an inch or a couple centimeters I'm just going to cut off the amount I'm going to shorten them by and use the piece I cut off to measure on the other strap so I cut off the same amount So that both my straps will be the same length So you want to make sure that the strap isn't twisted when you sew it in place So smooth it out nice and straight And then bring it back To meet where you cut it off the dress And just pinch that together with your fingers And now we'll sew it in place So with the threaded needle just go in through the fabric of the dress And then through the strap And don't pull the thread all the way through When you're almost through just go back Through the dress and the strap again Close to the same holes you just went through And then put your needle through the slip of thread and pull that tight And that creates a knot And we're going to do a bunch of knots to sew the strap in place So again you're just going through the dress through the strap And then through that loop of thread and pull it tight And we're going to do this all the way around the strap So now we're around to the other side And then we're just going to do one stitch Going directly through the center of the strap When you're back to where you started from just do a couple knots Putting your needle through that loop And pulling it tight And then you can cut your thread off And you're all done And now just do the same thing on the other side So now we're all done We've sewed the straps back in place And they're just a little shorter than they were before Yay yay Thank you so much for watching Cinderella so And I will see you soon POOPS
