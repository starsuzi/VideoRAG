 There are many ways to honor or pay tribute to a special experience or harvest or hunt, such as with a beautiful set of antlers. Another of my favorite things to do is to make a pendant out of an elk ivory, like this one that I'm wearing right now. Now elk ivory is to me into a lot of high-country people, carry special significance. They bring memories of bugling bull elk, the scent of pines in the high country and of wild deep backcountry experiences. So today I want to show you how to take an elk ivory and turn it into a pendant like this. So here's what you're going to need to make your elk ivory pendant. Obviously you're going to need to start off with an elk ivory. You're going to need two drill bits, one sixteenth and one eighth in size. You're going to need a little five eight inch long antler time tip and you're going to need some string, wax nylon string, artificial sinew or a piece of brain-town buckskin if you can find it. First step drill a hole on each side of your tooth at the base of the root top of the tooth with your one sixteenth inch drill bit. Come behind with your one eighth inch drill bit and chamfer the hole so they don't cut your string. Thread a piece of string through and tie it off. For if you wish, twist it into a piece of cordage. Tie one end of your cordage off in a bowline loop. In the other end, thread it through a hole drilled in your one eighth inch antler time tip. Burn the end off so it can't come back through and that leaves you with an elk ivory pendant with a great little antler tip closure for the back.
