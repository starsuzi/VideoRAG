 Hi, I'm James with JNC Home Repair. Today I'm going to show you how to paint over existing bathroom tiles. One thing to consider before you're painting on any kind of tiles or anything, you want to make sure that you use the right kind of paint for what you're doing. You don't want to use some kind of interior latex on ceramic tile because it's just not going to stick right. You want to do a little bit of research, check the product that you're using and then compare it to whatever kind of surface you're actually trying to paint it on. You just want to make sure that you use the right kind of paint. You can apply it with a brush or it can be sprayed. You'll see here that we're actually just going to apply this paint directly over the tile. You can see that it just brushes right on just like any other paint would any other surface. I would prefer like if you want to get that real smooth finish, you're probably going to want to do some kind of spraying. It's going to go on a lot smoother and you're not going to be able to see the brush marks and the streaks. But today, brushing on will work just fine. It just takes a little bit longer and you don't need to go by a real expensive paint spray to actually apply it. You can do it with just a basic paint brush and whatever type of paint you're actually trying to use. You can see it just applies right on real smooth and it's real nice and easy. It's basically all there is to it to applying paint to existing bathroom tiles.
