 Okay, so we just cut the walls in so our next step in paying the bathroom is to now roll them up So let's get everything that we need necessary for rolling the walls we have a roller tray A roller and the roller cover This is a half inch nap. It's for a semi smooth surface We're gonna put it right onto the roller And then what we want to do is we want to Do a little trick to get rid of any of the lint. There might be on it See when they're from the factory it's a little bit of lint that comes off We want to catch that so it doesn't end up on our walls So this is what we do take the painters tape and wrap it around All the way up and we can barb us pull Kip a whole entire thing And then we just put it right up There we go and you can see all that Let they cut on the tape would have been on your walls So when you walk into someone's house and you see that the walls are kind of hairy That's why So now let's pull the paint into the tray Just enough to form a nice little pool That should be good for now Gonna have too big of an area to paint Want to always take our brush, catch the drips Okay Okay, pretty good You want to basically get it into the paint just enough to get it wet And then we're rolling off the excess on this ramp part Okay, so now this is loaded with paint Now we're going to begin You want to get it right into our cut The paint that we cut So you want to get right in there get up as close as you possibly can You want to use this edge rather than that edge to run along the edge where you cut Because you can get in just a little bit closer I'm getting the paint on there Okay Gonna get right up to the edge as close as we can Probably about a half inch away from our cut edge So when you want to go So that way you're rolling right on the brush strokes And when it dries in You're not going to see the brush strokes at all And be very pleasing with the pan Now this is a small area Typically when you're working on a larger space you want to apply the paint on With the configuration of a V or a W or some sort of zigzag stroke And then you kind of go back into it and just even it out But where we taped and plastic We can just hold the lapel right onto there Don't worry Okay So that concludes the rolling of the wall for now There's always two coats recommended for the wall So what you want to do is you want to now set this aside And I'll show you how to do just that We'll put it up with paint So that doesn't dry out Nice and evenly wet Then you want to take a plastic bag or some of your plastic drop cloth Even so ran wrap and you just want to wrap it up nice and tight So you're going to Make sure that the plastic is snug right into the wet paint You just rolled it up pretty good You're going to have it Waiting overnight I recommend sticking it in the refrigerator To keep it nice and fresh At this point you can either keep it on your roller Or if you're going to be rolling another room or another area You remove it like this You take a A broomstick or a roller handle and you give it a tap And it just is a quick release It's right off
