 Welcome guys, we're going to show you how we sprout our hollyhock seeds and here's a couple hollyhock seeds right there. You've never seen any before. The variety that we're growing is going to be black watchmen. We actually sell these on eBay and we love the black ones. They stick out, they're really cool and they're easy to grow. The method we're going to use today is the pearlite method. I've already got seeds in there and the pearlite settled in there so we just use a regular pearlite and the solution we use to wet the pearlite is just the bottled water with a cap full of hydrogen peroxide. Any hydrogen peroxide, you can go to the store and just pick up any name brand doesn't matter even if it's not name brand whatever generic it's fine. Okay, so I've got the hollyhock seeds and the pearlite in there I'm going to do is just pour some of this into the bag here. You get it, that was a lot. If that happens guys, where you pour that water in and it's standing inside the bag see that? We don't want all that water in there, that was too much. So what we can do is we can get it poured out or we can just add more pearlite to the bag. That's better. I don't think we need to add more pearlite. All you do is seal the bag and hollyhocks sprouts very quick. It doesn't need a whole lot of anything to grow. You can keep temperatures at 60, 65 degrees for the hollyhock seeds and you know unfiltered lights fine. You can give it direct sunlight whatever on a windowsill. These are going to grow. These are pretty easy to grow and I would say in a few days we're going to have some sprouts in here so well upload video too. See how long it takes to get these to grow. If you're interested in buying some hollyhock seeds you can look at the bottom of the description. We've got a link. And that's about it guys. Very simple. We'll check back at about five days see what's going on inside the bag. Thanks again guys. We'll talk to you soon.
