 Here's how to make a very simple flower press using items you have at home. A sheet of cardboard, a sheet of regular copier paper, about three rubber bands, and then something to press. The way I start out is I take my sheet of cardboard and I cut it in half. And that will form the base of the press to take the paper, fold it in half, hamburger style, if you're a lap booker. And then open the sheet of paper and you can place your flower right inside. And if you want to do leaves, that works well too. I kind of hold it flat as I put the paper down on top and then replace the cardboard on the top. And that's basically what you do. I use two rubber bands going one way and one going the other. You can add extra rubber bands if you want to make it nice and tight, especially if you have a thicker flower that isn't going to lay as flat inside your press. Here's the press that we've been using and inside we have flowers from a few weeks ago. They're like they're really ready to go into our nature journals. You can layer the paper and the flowers if they're fairly flat flowers inside your press that works well. Or another way to do it, like you have a lot of flowers, is to stack your presses, which in this case, you could take your sheet like this and then just put one cardboard on the top and then replace your rubber bands. And that's a really simple press with items you have around the house. I take the whole package when I'm done with it and stick it under some really heavy bucks. We have a big dictionary or encyclopedias would work too. So that should give you a start on pressing flowers for your nature journal.
