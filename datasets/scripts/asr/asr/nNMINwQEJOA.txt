 Today I'm going to build a entire bird house out of just one two-by-four. So I've got this two-by-four that has been sitting on my lumber rack for a while and I want to turn it into something useful. So what I'm going to do is attempt to build a entire bird house out of this and it's not going to be very big. As you can see this is actually pretty twisted but that's not going to be a big deal because it will cut this into a bunch of small pieces and the twist will be very very little in those small pieces. So let's go ahead and rock cut all of these pieces. So now because I don't have a plane here I'm going to cut this last edge on the table saw and this direction. And this is technically considered re-sign and if you do not feel comfortable using a table saw for this then do not do it. I will just then go with hand planes and do this. So I've cut all of my pieces down to what I'm going to do. So I've cut all of my pieces down to one inch thick and now what I'll do is cut it down again to five eighths and that way I'll have a thicker piece and then a thinner piece to work with. When I do the assembly of the bird house and most likely I'll use the thinner pieces for the roof. So that's going to be where I have the stock today. I'll let this sit in the clamps overnight to let the glue completely dry and then tomorrow we'll start working on the roof pieces and I actually have more than enough to use for the roof. So I'm also maybe going to put some sort of platform on the bottom. So if you're enjoying this project just run over to the hardware store and just pick up a 2-by-4. You can do this project in just about two days. So if you're liking what I'm doing and enjoyed watching this project I'd like to invite you to subscribe to my channel. I tried to upload new videos almost every day. Also put a comment down in the comment section if you think one is necessary and also hit that like button. I really do appreciate that and I will see you in the next part.
