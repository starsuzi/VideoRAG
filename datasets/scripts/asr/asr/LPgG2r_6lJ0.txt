 In this video, I will demonstrate how the look on this painted antique chair was achieved. In order to achieve this look on your furniture, you will need to start with a piece that has already been painted white. The supplies needed for this project are Minwak Stain in Ebony, a chip brush, rags and sandpaper. Starting with a painted piece of furniture, you will need to sand it using 100 grit sandpaper. First sand the sharp edges, such as the front of the legs or any corners. If your piece of furniture has carved details, sand those areas as well. Start by lightly sanding and continue until you have achieved the desired effect. You may want to stand back and periodically examine your work. Remember, it's easy to add more distressing, but if you get it too heavy, then you may have to start all over again by painting it. So take your time. The more you sand, the more contrast you will create. Once the piece has been distressed to your liking, the next step is to stain it. Before staining, make sure you wipe the piece clean and free of dust. To stain, use Minwak's wood finish, which you can purchase at your local hardware store in the paint department. This product will penetrate, stain and seal. In this video, we are using Ebony-colored Minwak's. To apply the stain, use a lint-free cloth that has been saturated. Cover the entire surface with the stain. If there are any recessed areas with lots of detail, use an inexpensive throwaway brush to drive the stain into all of the details. Then use a clean, lint-free cloth to buff the surface to a smooth, uniform finish. If you are working on a very large piece of furniture, work in small sections at a time so the stain does not get tacky and unworkable before you are finished removing it. The stain will lightly change the color of the paint and in recessed areas at depth and contrast.
