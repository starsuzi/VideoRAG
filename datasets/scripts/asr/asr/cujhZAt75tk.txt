 Hi, it's Elastic Granny. Did you ever get out your balsamic vinegar and it had like a lump in it and a big old glob? Well guess what? If you smell it and it still smells good, it's still all right. This is what's called the mother and you can actually make more vinegar from the mother. So what you do is you take a coffee filter and I'm just putting it into my canning jar funnel and I have a jar and then I'm going to pour the balsamic in here and let it strain out the mother. Then I can still use the vinegar that comes in the bottom and then if I want to make more I can leave the mother in a crock and add a little wine and let it in a cool dark place and maybe put a piece of cheesecloth over it and I can make more vinegar. But in the meantime it looks kind of gross and you might think you have to throw it all out but as long as it smells okay you don't. So sometimes the hardest part is getting that mother out of a jar. There. So it looks like liver. With the help of a fondue fork and a chopstick I finally got all of it out of the bottle. So now what I'm going to do is take this now that it's been all drained and I'm going to load the mother into this jar. Yeah that is kind of gross. I'm going to cover the mother now with a coffee filter and a rubber band and I'm going to set it aside with my spices and then whenever I have leftover red wine I'm going to add a little bit and after a few months I'll have some new balsamic vinegar. Then I'm going to take the strained vinegar and pour it back into the bottle with a funnel and there I have all my nice balsamic vinegar ready to use for my next recipe. So if you find lumpy balsamic vinegar don't throw it away strain it out and make more if you want. Okay leave me a tip on things you've learned about vinegar and please subscribe to the Alaska Granny channel. Have a wonderful day.
