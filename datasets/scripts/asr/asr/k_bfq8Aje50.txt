 What's up guys? I'm here and welcome back to brand new episode. So today I'm gonna do something in the kitchen I still do not know what I want to do, but I'm gonna do something I am not really in the creative mood right now. I'm joking. I'm always creative I'm gonna start rambling now and let's get to the video But papa, let's move the camera to the kitchen. Oh, it's dark Hello Okay guys now we're in the kitchen, dude. Let's just look at them drawers to see if there's something interesting that I can make. How about we make DIY Dr. Pepper? I mean, that's a little something isn't it? I have this right here, which is Dr. Pete So let's turn Dr. Pete into Dr. Pepper, okay? That's how creative I am today boys This my friends is a soda stream machine. You haven't seen one before you've probably been living under a rock because They're all over the place. Basically what I saw the stream machine does is to turn water into soda. Oh my god That's sick. So basically what you do is to take this and you fill it with water Now as you probably can see there's a line there somewhere Yeah, you have to fill the water up to there. I haven't done this in a while by the way But as far as I remember you just put this on here, okay, you press the button check this out. This is the scary part Okay, that's scary sound right there means that it's done Oh boy You have sparkling water Woohoo, and now to make Dr. Pepper you have to put this shit in here. Okay, okay The entire thingy up and then you pour the Dr. Pepper syrup. Oh Fucking hell Over that was great success. Okay, so there's that DIY Dr. Pepper I feel like such a freaking troll right now, but we made Dr. Pepper come on DIY do it yourself. I made the doctor pepper myself. So this is not damn DIY Okay, I really hope you enjoyed this silly little video if you did make sure to smash the like button And I'll see you guys next week with a brand new video
