 We have all this dirtiness around your face. I do. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, but it's a bit of a salad. Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! So today, we're going to try a Mexican ilote. Yeah. Would they say the right? I think so. It'll matter. No problem. All right. So, not only are we going to try it, we're also going to make it ourselves. All right. We have butter, mayonnaise, cotija cheese, chili, salt, and lime. And of course corn. Corn. Ah, pebamos arriba. Ah, bono. Pero, te tú te la va a ter mano. Claro, bono. Te lo dojo, te lo dojo, la vamos a la mano. Yeah, pero no voy a dure aftora. Mate. Me está topeo, le está bien. Tica, tica, tica, tica. Mines didn't have all that pebos. Ha-ha-ha! I get waxed. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Come into the sun, let me get you a bit faster. I just said, I'm gonna say something. Yeah, I'm gonna say something. Okay, I got it. Come on, come on. First step, good. First step. So, I think we put mayonnaise and butter first. Tavio. So, let's put both of them, because I want mine to be extra loose. Mate, I'm following you step. So, if I put it up, it's your fault. Well, I'm not Mexican. I don't know how to do this. That's an important thing. I got to blame somebody. Who can make a better look? We should do a little challenge. Oh, you got them. You put that shit up quick. Okay, I know how to cook. I mean, that's so fast. This is not a fast forward. No, I'm out. Exactly how hard it works. No mega pasabe wins. Is there a right way to make Mexican gluten? I don't think so, but let's put man, a lot of mayonnaise. I like that shit like that, yo. Yo, this is awesome. Look how pretty it looks. No, I like a whole lot more mayo on my sister. I like cheese. I'm a cheese fanatic. You know what? I'm gonna just sprinkle this shit up, see. Yo, it's a good idea. Mate. You're gonna put all of that chili, whatever spicy. It's all over your mouth, mama. All over your mouth. One of those throughout one year, my face burning, then you're gonna be like, I'm the way around. That's all I know about that. Cheers. Saigon. Mm, mm, mm. Oh wow. Mm. This is fire. That is so good. The thing is, it's so many different tastes. And flavors. Flavor. Flavor. It's not spicy. So you have the lemon. You have a little bit of like the salt that, you know. My favorite part is that it is, there's cheese on it. You know what it is? It's like sweet and sour. You get the sour at first and then, when you buy into the corn, that's in the sweet, sweet and sour. And it all blends in together. I had to do it. I had to eat the whole thing. God damn girl. Yeah, never. It was so good. It was so good. I think. No wonder y'all love it so much. It's so good. This is probably one of the best things I've tasted. Great job, Mexico. Yeah, it says, I just made a second one. And I was only supposed to make the first one. But that's how good. Hell yeah. That is how good. This is amazing. Mexico, thank you for your notice. Gracias. We appreciate it. From the Dominican Republic and the Battle of Mahars, we love you. Mm.
