 Hey folks, I'm Luke from The Standard and today I'm going to teach you how to make a chocolate martini. First of all, get your 10, build nice. Start with three all of our three off chocolate vodka, do a three count. Do a two count of this. Kaluah, also a two count. And the last ingredient is frangeloco, of course a two count as well. Now for the sake of aesthetic purposes, it's really nice. Always have some Hershey syrup. Get your glass. Give it a nice, pretty design. I am a no way an artist, but do as much as God's giving you. So there you are. Take the top. Throw out your 10, give it a really good shake. Strain it. And voila, you have a chocolate martini. Enjoy.
