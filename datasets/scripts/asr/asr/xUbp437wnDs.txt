 Nothing so is the great outdoors like a big fat grass stain. I'm Suzanne here at the Real Simple Studio and I'm going to show you two ways to get the green out. The first is with a pre-treatment product which you can buy any place where you buy leery laundry detergents. You get this and you squirt a little on the stain. Let it sit for about 15 minutes and then pick up an old rag and old nail brush and old toothbrush and treat the stain, scrub it around a little bit to get it going. The second tip is a more natural way to go. You're going to take some vinegar, like one part vinegar, pour it in a bowl, add two parts water and then you're going to treat the stain as you would with the other product. You're going to put a little on with the spoon or with an old rag, give it a scrub and then it's going to go in the laundry. You're going to want to use an enzyme-based laundry detergent which is your kind of garden variety laundry detergent. You're going to have enzymes in it and that breaks up the protein. And hopefully by the end of your treatment your shorts will look like this, clean and almost brand new.
