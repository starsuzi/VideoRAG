I had some what I can get for five bucks. I ended up putting an ice cream sundae. I had a banana split. When I said banana split, he showed me a picture, and I was in love. After that, I watched him make it, and he was so pumped to make it for me. I don't know why, but he was so excited. That got me excited. When he made it for me, I thought it was the most beautifulest thing ever. I brought him home, whipped it out, closed my door. I did not want anybody to bother me when I'm eating a banana split. Went to town. Went to town with this. The most delicious thing I ever ate. The next day, I told my sister she gave me five bucks. I can get her something so awesome. Guess what I got her? The banana split. I wouldn't tell her where I got it. She probably knew what it was because the Deripin logo, but I didn't tell her where it was. When I got her the banana split brought home. Surprise there. I don't know why, but I was just so excited for her to try it. It was like my own creation or my fine. I wouldn't tell her where it was.
