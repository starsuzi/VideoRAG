 Hi, welcome back to our series of how-to videos. Today we're going to cook up a drink, but a cocktail. Let's do a Caesar or a bloody Caesar. And yes, it's both commonly referred to both ways, it doesn't matter what you call it. Primarily this is a drink of Canadian origin, but it's delicious, it's great any time of year. We're gonna kind of kick it up a few notches and make it a, let's call it the Bubbacue Caesar salad. We're gonna add the general ingredients of some vodka and some woosh worchester shires, some hot sauce, some salt, some pepper, some comato, some rim or celery salt, some celery. We're also gonna add some lemon, some pickles, which are great with it, a little horse radish, and how about some shrimp too? Let's get started. So start off rimming your glass and just get some fresh lemon juice. I mean, you can use that pre-bottled stuff, but the fresher is better. Rim the inside, no side glass, and then dredge it, and your seasoning salt. Now that can be some celery salt, it can be this little Caesar-ridden mix, just like that. Okay, that's it. Okay, next we're gonna add some ice. This is a big glass, so we're gonna add, let's say roughly, two shots of vodka, less if you're so inclined, a couple of squirts of worchester shire, a couple of squirts of hot sauce, some salt, some fresh ground pepper. Now I like to add about a teaspoon of horse radish. I also like to drop in a pickle into the middle, and I like to toss in a lemon at this point. Okay, next, gonna add in some shrimp, some extra pickles on the skewer, because we're gonna want to eat those. Top it up with your clomato juice. Bring that up, rest these kind of float them across the top, and put some celery in there. Maybe a little cocktail shrimp along the front side. A little stir on the bottom with that stick of celery you put in there, and you have a boba Caesar salad. Now that's a drink for a king.
