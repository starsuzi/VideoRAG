 Hi and welcome to what's going on cupcake on today's show we're going to be making turkey cupcake okay um we've got up here so you can get a view of the entire show okay we're just start out with the ingredients over here we're going to pre-made cupcakes we also have little caramel candies non-prells will be using the green ones rolled gold pretzel pins special okay cereal or cornflakes don't forget your green frosting for your coloring and one can of buttercream frosting okay I think we're ready to get started the first thing you'll do is frost your cupcake next you're going to microwave caramel so they're nice and soft so you can roll them out into a nice flat shape we used a template and we cut around it and this is the product this is going to be the skin of the turkey all right the first thing we'll do is we're going to coat our special case cereal with green frosting and this is going to be our lettuce as you can see in the display turkey we're going to wind this like so I recommend keeping these in the freezer until we're ready to use them as they are very briculous as you can see important these are sturdy because this is what your turkey leg is going to rest on okay now we're going to add your better shot at what I'm doing here our turkey skin you're going to place it on and kind of form it into a turkey you don't have to be too worried about because we're going to add other things so you can shape as you go on the next thing that you'll be putting in is the stuffing in the front now all you've done to create a little stuffing balls is rolling the crushed special pay into white frosting and then also rolling it in the green armba roast a little extra frosting and add it to the front I'm just going to rest it there now to make our turkey legs all we had to do is once again melt one piece of caramel and add in the pretzel stick and form it around the pretzel into this sheen actually here then properly you're going to wet the sides of the turkey legs or the turkey and it would form a adhesive bond one moment please will I let my paper towel okay all right now we're going to stick on the turkey legs crossing them underneath the stuffing so it also supports it and while you're doing that you can also work on shaping your turkey and we're almost finished our last step is making the I don't know what they're called a little white thing on the bottom of the turkey legs so I'm going to use a nice tool here from one of our studio audience members thanks out there and I'm just going to inject a little frosting okay that's about it now we're ready for our turkey dinner that's it for today folks hope you enjoyed what's going on cupcake and have a happy Thanksgiving
