 Hi, I'm Amy and today's maker minute is all about seasonal grilled vegetables. Today I'm using zucchini, red peppers and asparagus. You can use whatever looked nice to you at your farmer's market or grocery store. Alright, we're going to douse the vegetables in some olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and then I have some fresh rosemary and thyme. And then you can just give them a toss. You can use your hands or a spoon. And then I have my grill pan nice and hot. And I'm going to take my first batch of vegetables and layer them on here. I'm going to try to put them in a single layer just so each veggie has equal opportunity to get those nice grill lines. And then we're going to cook the vegetables a few minutes on each side just turning when need be. It should only take about 10 minutes total. That looks good for now. And then we're going to come back and see how they're doing. Okay, our vegetables are just about ready here. So this is my last batch. I'm going to move them to the platter with their friends. And everything is looking and smelling delicious. I can smell those fresh herbs. Oh, I can't wait. Alright, these vegetables make a perfect side dish to any meal. But I like to pair it with some fresh pesto and crusty bread for the perfect appetizer. This recipe more can be found at everydayepicures.com. This is your maker minute. Until next time.
