 I'm Caroline and this is Romeo the Cat and today Romeo and I are going to demonstrate how to clean a cat's ears using Q-tips and Romeo has some interesting ears he actually is a rescued cat a rescued Persian cat and when he came to the rescue he was completely deaf in both of his ears due to the best thing in ear at the food allergy and so while he was in rescue he had eight surgeries on his ears so his little ears are a little bit this one's a little bit deformed it looks like he has one ear but he actually has a little ear right there it's just folded down anyway because he has these problems we like to clean his ears as often as possible and make sure that they don't have any wax or debris in there most facts recommend that you clean your cats' ears every few weeks and make sure that you check them once a week to see that there's not any obstructions or build up in there so we clean Romeo's ears in the following way first we use an ear wash that you can you can get a recommendation from your vet this one I got at pet people and you give a couple of drops into his little ear like this and then you kind of massage those drops into his ear like this to dislodge any of the wax or dirt that's in there and then what you're going to want to do is take a cotton ball and wipe out the outside of his ear see if you can get any there you go some dirt like that and then the best way to really get the wax out of the little crevices in his ear as he uses a Q-tip and very gently obviously clean out the little crevices you can see he has these little indentations you have to make sure that you do not put the Q-tip down in the cat's ears that could be very bad but you can see the amount of dirt that you can get off just from that little white and what you're going to want to do I'm not going to make him do this but clean out those crevices in one ear and then repeat it in the other ear and that's pretty much all you need to do good boy Romeo
