 We are going to show you how to make this very very realistic fake egg. If you are new to my channel Hello Muffy please subscribe for more videos like this and let's get into it. Isn't this super cool? You can use this fake egg to make pranks for a school project or just for fun. For this you will need Elmer's glue. How much? Well, depending on the size you want your egg to be. For the egg whites I use almost entire bottle of Elmer's glue. Then in another bowl add one cup of water and one 1-2 cups of borax. Make sure the borax is when dissolved into the water and pour half of that cup into the cup with Elmer's glue. And you will see how instantly the glue is transformed into this rubbery plastic consistency though. Mix it with your hands and then continue to make the shape of the egg white. As you can see it looks and feels totally real. To make the joke of the egg pour the rest of the glue into a cup and add one drop of gel of food coloring and mix. Once that is ready add the rest of the water and the products and mix again. Do the same as the egg whites but now make a tiny bowl to represent the egg yolk and that's it! I don't know if you can tell but this egg looks totally real and I'm super impressed with this DIY. Just remember that this isn't edible and it can be toxic. So if you're going to make a prank just be careful with that. That's it for today's video guys. I really hope you like my idea.
