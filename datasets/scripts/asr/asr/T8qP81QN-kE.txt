It's getting very cold now Well, I guess I mean it's like 55 degrees where I live But to me that constitutes pretty cool Anyways today we are making these really cute turkey Thanksgiving cupcakes And you also might notice that today something is a little bit different about the studio Because I just got this new sign back here that says Kauai. I think it is so cute And I am really excited about it I think it stands out against the wall really nicely and I love that I was like customized Probably bring with me when I go to college too and that is from pottery barn teen by the way Which leads me into an exciting announcement that I have I'm doing a three episode holiday baking collaboration with pottery barn teen I am so excited about it might have used the word excited already Whoops, anyways the video is going to be posted over here on my channel and then also on the PB teen YouTube channel So make sure you go on over there and check it out But yeah, I'm really excited about this series I think you guys are going to love it. I'm going to be showing you some really cute PB teen products along the way that you can check out Yeah, let's go ahead and make these cupcakes now. So let's get started First off, let's make our vanilla cupcakes You're going to need one stick or one half cup of softened butter Get that nice and creamy Then we're going to add in one cup of sugar And just mix that in until it gets nice and light and fluffy Now we're going to crack in two room temperature eggs Go ahead and add them in one at a time and mix after each addition Once that is nice and smooth, we're going to add in one teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix that in two Now for our dry ingredients, I'm going to need one and a half cups of flour Along with one and three quarters teaspoons of baking powder And then just give this a whisk Now it's time to put it all together. You're going to add half of your dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and Just mix this up And it's also nice to use a spatula now when you make sure you don't over mix your batter Then we're going to add in a half cup of milk And mix that in two. Don't worry if the batter gets kind of thin because now we're going to add in the second half of our dry ingredients And continue mixing until it gets nice and smooth Now I'm going to use an ice cream skim to evenly divide this between 12 cupcake liners And we're just going to bake this off by 350 for about 20 minutes In the meantime we can work on our frosting. You're going to need two sticks of softened butter and Go ahead and get these nice and creamy Then we're going to add in three cups of powdered sugar. I like to add it in one cup at a time That way you don't just get a big cloud of powdered sugar. Definitely not something you want to have to clean up So here's the second cup And the third cup At this point your frosting is going to be pretty thick, but don't worry. We're going to thin it out with some milk in a bit But first we're going to add in a teaspoon of vanilla extract And mix that in And then I'm going to add in a splash of milk about two to three tablespoons or until you get a nice light consistency Next I'm going to divide this between three different bowls one for each color of our turkey And you're going to color one bowl red with some red gel food coloring Now we're just going to load our frosting into a piping bag fitted with a small round tip Don't worry if you don't have a piping bag or piping tip you can just put it in a zip lock bag and snip the corner Repeat this process with orange frosting and also yellow frosting At this point our cupcake should be ready and lately I've been looking for like pretty much any excuse to use this really cute Cake phone stand that it has got and if you're interested in it or any of the cute little trays that I've been using throughout the video I'll have all the products linked in the description box below to PB team dot com Anyways, once your cupcakes are out of the oven go ahead and transfer them to a cooling rack and let them cool completely And once they're cooled we can start to decorate I'm just going to take the red frosting first and pipe little dots around the outside Make sure you pipe these pretty close to the edge that way you'll have room for all three of your colors Next I'm going to take a little baby spoon and kind of smush down the points to give it that feather like effect We're gonna repeat this with the orange frosting again a ring of those little dots and Then smushing them down with a spoon And since the yellow bit is pretty small we're gonna make it easier by just piping kind of a star shape Next up you're gonna need some chocolate candy melts and you can just get these from a craft store I'm gonna add these on as the face of our turkey You're also going to need some yellow heart sprinkles and Just use a little dab of melted chocolate to attach it on as the nose Then I'm taking some melted black candy melts. I'm gonna add in two dots for each eye And this last step is totally optional, but I think it's a nice touch I'm gonna take some melted red candy melts and add that turkey waddle on the side and That's it All right guys our turkey Thanksgiving cupcakes are finished now and these look really cute I think it's also makes a really nice Thanksgiving table centerpiece all I've to do is put them on a cake stand Get some fake feats from Michaels or real leaves for a feeling adventurous and it makes a really festive display Anyway, I hope you guys enjoyed this video look out for the other PB teen videos coming soon And I'll see you guys next time.
