 Well hello this is our video of actually putting down edging we're using the valley view connectors to make it look very nice and I'm going to remove this air edging up we're gonna dig around the grass we're gonna make it about a five foot trench all the way around get the rocks and everything up and then we're going to place the edging down and I'll be back in a few minutes to show you how we did it you want to make sure that you're pulling the dirt away from the grass back up on the hill and that you're using the flat shovel you can use a pointed shovel but it take a little more time you get a flat flat in a shovel that take a lot of less time because you can see how I can just put it in there just pull it up just like that that's how you want to pull it up want to make sure you pull up your dirt you want to 45 inches also deep all the way around you want to make sure that you cut the edging a little lower so it can slide up under the connector the corner connector if not it's gonna hit the corner connector it's gonna be way out here somewhere it won't go up under it so it would look flush when you get ready to set your corner all right and as you can see we got the other ones down we got to flush up against the seam here all right so this is the finished part of our edge as you can see we've got it thank you for watching
