 It's all well and good cooking your turkey for Christmas Day, but it needs friends. It needs a company month. Now let's make some bread sauce. So here's the list of ingredients that you'll need to make it. First need to prepare the onion. Now you're popping it into the milk so it doesn't need to be chopped up finely just in half and then peel it. Next we need to study it with the clothes. We've got 700 milliliters of milk in their full fat, wholesome milk and we're just going to add the onion, add in the bay leaves and grate in the nutmeg. Then once the milk has come to a full boil, turn it down to a simmer. Let the mixture simmer for five minutes and then remove it from the heat and let it stand for at least 15 minutes. All of those beautiful herbs and spices have done their job now so it's time to strain that milk. Now we need to make our breadcrumbs for our bread sauce. Simply get a few slices of bread and blend them in a food processor until you have fine breadcrumbs. Now we need to add the milk, batch the hob and bring it to the boil again. Now we can begin to stir the breadcrumbs in. They'll begin to thicken as they're added so add them slowly until you have a consistency that you're happy with. Once it's there put it into a serving bowl and you're ready to go. Bread sauce, fantastic! Christmas dinner would not be the same without it.
