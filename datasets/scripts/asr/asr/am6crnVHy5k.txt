 Hello everyone, welcome and join me in this step cooking. Today I'm going to share with you a quick bite. How you can make your polysauce, links with onion and basically we're going to make it caramelized onion. So I'm going to share with you how we can make it real quick, fast and delicious. Let's get started. I start my gas, all out of butter. I'll bring my leg. You turn around and now in the same butter I'm going to bring onion, cut into long slices, top onion and I'm going to cook my onion until they get caught light. Keep turning your links so they don't get burnt. Within 2-3 minutes, our onion will be ready. Oh, they're looking so good. I'm going to bring a little bit salt according to your taste, black pepper and that's it. And my onions are looking good. I'm going to turn my gas off and I'm going to grab my link. I'm going to cut right in the middle, same thing on other. I turn my gas off already. Now I can stop my onion. Oh, this is going to be real delicious. Stop your onion in there. Oh boy, it's going to be yummy. It's all done. The links you always can serve with a little bit mustard. Catch up. You can use anything whatever you like. It's so easy to make and of course I like hot chili. Just a little amount, just like that. Perfect, all-opinion and some dill. My momia, mouth-watering. I'm going to share with you. This is so delicious. Can't wait. Big. Yummy. I'm going to try it. I'm going to take a bite. So delicious. The colonized onion, the taste really good even without the bread. Very tasty. Very yummy. I really appreciate each one of you joining. Easy stuff. Thank you for watching. Bye-bye.
