 Hello we're going to introduce we're going to change up with our aquarium from 10 gallon tank to 20 gallon tank and it has been filled with the tap water from the from there it's a cold water and we already put around 18 gallon there but before we can put the fees we need to put use the air conditioner where is that? okay there you go we bought it everything in from Patco here so it's a one dropper gallon so we have been dropping for around 18 gallon and before that we're going to make sure the temperature is good so the temperature is let me see supposed to be on the green side so okay I think when you put inside there stick it here okay okay you see the red one is around on the 20 sides so we are good to go next we're going to put the gravel so this is for it yes put all of them so can you get me that I'm gonna try to use it oh let me do it okay let me do it this way yeah already washed this gravel the first time we bought from Patco is kind of dirty you need to rinse it first multiple times until the water is clear now we have another bowl over there okay one named out okay just dump the rest of it there yeah good better it's not a bowl not a bowl of it damn you're just gonna spread it around spread it around okay okay let's okay still a bit Okay, next we put the artificial plan. It's actually plastic plan. It's a plastic plan against to get it easy. So you don't have to... Maybe for the ear, something like this maybe. You put the rock underneath or you snore. Hi, I'm going to make you only the other one. You can see the inside and sink it in. Okay. They end there. Then put another one more. This artificial grass. You can put it over here. Okay, you can put there. Just put it a bit to this. Every section has plan. Our fish likes to hide in the cork. Oh, that is floaty. Floating. So we need to put some rocks. Put some rock in it. Oh yeah, in the middle. So we have to put some rock in the middle. Yeah. Oh gosh. This grass is hard to. Just sink the cork. Put more rock. No, no, no. Put the rock on the pole there. It's sort of hard, you know what I mean? Put more rock. Okay, let's see. Right down there. I think it's supposed to be floating. Don't think so. This is the first of the spot. I think it's just. Okay. Next step is. Next is to get the water circulator. And also the filter. We bought it. It's a tetra. Oh, for 20 gallon tank. Whisper. Whisper EX2ND0. We just put it here. Actually you could put the end here. Put in one of the corners. Just slide it there. And then you get the cane. And block the cane. And block the cane. Then we suck the water inside. There is a filter inside here. There we go. The water is flowing there. And you will also actually have this. Well, for LA you can see the tube. This is a tube for a bubble machine. So you just stick it right over here. And then you put it anywhere actually. So I think it's. You like to swim in the corner usually. Let me try. I have to stay here. And then you can do a little bit of blocks. Top. This thing usually works like something out of that. Then it's going to the air pump. And we block second one. Then we create the bubble there. You can see. It's the bubble. And water filter. So you need to take out the bubble from the bottom. There is a bubble. You see here. You see. I'll show you how to clean it. You just slide it. There is a hole right over here. And you just plug it in. Oh my, what the. Okay. Hold it out. You did a trick. Okay. Like that. This vent of fishing is. No, whatever. Which way it is. And last is the piece of course. And we actually have the feeder. Let's do the fish one first. Okay. Let's do the fish. We have three, four. Okay. That's a black one. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. And then it. Guys. Come on. Come on. Now that way down. Now just go down. Okay. Okay. We're going to have to go through. Okay. Now why they cooked a lot? Just be like a few minutes and then cook a lot. Okay. Come on. Okay. And that one is a red head. Red head, you're okay. When it's very big, the head will have a red crown. You're going to be. Yeah. And the last one is the black one. The last one is yesterday. The last one is yesterday. You got one. Just get in there. Wow. Can you really see this? It's like that. And there we go. Oh my. I put some poop in there. So we have the fish ready. The last thing you need to put is the fish feeder. You know when we go travel, we go to work. Sometimes we need to keep feeling two or three times a time. So this is the fish feeder from a minute and a half. You can adjust, at the opening, how much we can feed. And how many, what time do you plan to feed? You can feed four times a day. You can just insert on the one of the corner. Wow. The poop push maybe like how many? So the fish is using a flag. Flag fish. Well actually we also put them. There is a. It also put a lot of fish. And it's a spinner, but they bit dry. And there's the time. We're going to. And this is the granular. And we have those. So inside, we just put it there. Okay. This is the. This is the flag. Flag fish. Like that. And with that one you need to put non-close to the water because it's going to be moist. So you have to be a spinner. It's hard to make sure it's not getting moist. Even moist will be clog everywhere. So. I knew that. Just keep on spinning. That was actually. Okay. Okay. And that's it for preparing a new. And not now because the fish is just adjusting new environment. Later on they have a timer already. Okay. Thank you for watching. Happy fishing. Happy swimming in a new bigger fish tank. 20 gallon for 20 bucks from Petco. Okay. Bye.
