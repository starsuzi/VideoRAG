 Flans grown in apartments generally belong to evergreen species. But even so, the reduction of the hours of daylight causes a period of semi-dormancy for these plants too. This means that you don't have to water and fertilise your plants regularly during the winter months. Indeed, too much watering or too much fertilizer can lead to a detrimental stagnation of water in the soil or to an excess of mineral salts which can cause severe symptoms in plants, such as yellowing or loss of foliage. Already in September or October, you should cut out the fertilizer, which you will resume in late winter or early spring. At that time, you should start to give your plants water only when the soil is completely dry. Watering should be very moderate using small amounts of water. Watering during this period of the year should only moisten the soil. Always avoiding residues of water in the bottoms of the pods to avoid buildups of water over days on end, with the consequent possibility of developing rocks that will affect the roots. Even in the case of plants that like abundant and regular watering, remember to reduce the supply of water a little. In the winter, domestic heating usually causes a very dry climate, which is why you must remember to spray the foliage of house plants frequently, increasing the humidity to simulate the climate in their places of origin. For succulent plants, watering can be stopped completely. And resume at the end of winter.
