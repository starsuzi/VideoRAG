 You're looking at a number 10 can of the Thrive 6-Grain Pancake Mix. This is a really delicious Pancake Mix and it stores for 10 years in the number 10 can. And you mix it up with about a three parts mix to two parts. A water ratio, a Thrive on the direction says use three and a third cups of mix with two and a half cups of water. So just about three to two mix to water and that's all you need. So we're going to go ahead and mix some of this up and show you what they look like. Okay, we're going to go ahead and mix up the Thrive 6-Grain Pancake Mix. And we'll be using a just a basic three parts mix, two parts water ratio. So we'll go ahead and do that. So I'm going to use, I'm just going to use one cup of mix and so I'm going to break that into thirds, make it easy to do the conversion. So there's a third, another third, and then go ahead and finish off with one more. There's the third, the third third, sorry I'm a cowboy cook so it's messy and a little not quite by the book but that's okay. So now we'll add our water, there's a third, we'll add the second, third, keep that, keep the right mix. I'm just going to use a fork, those are the views that I've been with us before or been on camp house with me. And now I just try to keep it simple. You know, obviously pancakes you can make up pretty easy yourself. What's nice about these is you can have these stored and they would have everything in it ready to go. So it mixed up pretty nicely, few little lumps left, not too bad. These will make nice pancakes. I'm going to heat up the griddle and then we'll bring it back, we'll get it over there to show you cooking these. Add a quarter cup of mix. Get it to bubble up about halfway. Make sure it's nice and nice and down on one side and flip it over. So far so good. The bubbles are starting to hold so it's probably just about time to go ahead and flip it over. Oh nice, it's perfect.
