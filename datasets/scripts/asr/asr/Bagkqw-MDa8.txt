 Hello to all my friends out there and I'm making some cucumber sandwiches. I have partially frozen bread and I put some margarine and I put some horse radish sauce and here's the recipe. Right here. Okay and now I want to put some horse radish sauce. I have horse radish sauce and cucumbers and I want to put a little on each side of the bread. And I peeled my cucumbers because you know they can have a lot of residences stuff and then I want to put some salt and pepper on my cucumber sandwiches. I was excited. I couldn't find the sauce for the horse radish sandwiches for a while. So there is my horse radish sandwich. Okay I'll be back in a few minutes.
