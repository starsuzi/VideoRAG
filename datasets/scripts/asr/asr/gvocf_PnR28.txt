 Hello, hello, hello you guys and welcome back to my channel. I am so excited because in today's video We are going to completely redo the entire plant background that you see before me So every single video from this one forward is gonna have an entire name An entirely new layout so without further ado, let's get into it Alrighty, so this is the current setup I have This is what you guys are most familiar with seeing as you can tell it is super cluttered There are plants on the floor my little table is full of plants and it clearly a solution needs to be made so that I can maximize mass space I Had been hunting for a shelf that fit the requirements of what I was looking for I wanted something kind of wide and had multiple shelves to it with enough height difference Between each shelf layer. I was able to find one on a website. I'll link to it in my description box down below I found it surprisingly difficult actually though to find a shelf that wasn't super tall that it would block the window But still had enough space and surface area to make this transition worthwhile The shelf itself was freakishly easy to install it was a total breeze and I loved it Already so the shelf is all done now we are gonna work on transferring all the different plants on to here Ah, and before I continue for those of you who don't know I am pregnant I am currently in my third trimester of pregnancy So that is why I look even more bubbly than normal the baby is super healthy super happy and likes to make a point to wiggle vigorously Whenever they see fit they also respond very well to chicken fun or at least that's what I tell Ryan But it may or may not be my secret ploy to make sure that I get chicken fun because Yum this rearranging has now turned into a total cleaning session So we're cleaning this window that is notorious for having doggy Like noses smushed up against it as you can see right there because I always call it the dogs TV when they Look out aside and they get so focused and so excited they smushed their faces against it and it's kind of hysterical So we're cleaning the dogs TV look at that I found the whole process of actually adding this new shelf to be fantastic because it really allowed me to Reassess where I was putting my plants how they were doing in their current location and also just see how they were all doing Do a major checkup on them. I'm usually the type of person to put a plant in a spot and not really fussed with it too much But honestly I enjoyed this whole experience so much and I found so much value in rearranging them and checking up on them so intensely That I'm pretty sure I'm gonna rearrange the opposing wall Which is kind of like where you see that split leaf monster are poking out right along there I have a ton more plants that honestly probably got very jealous with all the attention going to these other guys So you know got to keep it equal I don't want the two of these sides like throwing you know Mealy bugs back and forth at each other like take that no you take that you know what I mean So if you're interested in seeing a part two to this idea Please let me know in the form of a big old thumbs up as well as a comment down below because it really helps me be like People responded well to this video. Therefore I should do it again You know And yes, you are correct that a couple seconds ago. I did attempt to do a little fast forwarded boogie dance. It's very exciting All right, so we're gonna take a quick break from here at the next time you see this room Everything's gonna be where it's meant to be Drum roll please Ta-da I know it's almost as majestic as my editing skill Honestly though I could not be happier with it I was amazed with how much more space I had I literally had an entire empty shelf full of possible new plans to occupy it Plus I found out a new way to hang my monstera Vining plant which is always very exciting because I love it very very much Eventually it could very well take over my house and I would not complain I also moved my beloved fiddle leaf over into this corner instead of the mask quorum plant So it could get more sun because it was constantly reaching for sun Plus I went around and dusted off every single leaf of my plants to make sure they're Sparkly clean and happy and replaced every plastic liner with a thicker higher rimmed one So all my plant arunis were very happy about this except for maybe the plants on the other side Sorry guys. I'll get to you Just don't start some sort of a revolution about this. I don't need any buggy warfare I'm kind of afraid. I'm gonna come home to like a cannonball machine full of spider mites Poo peeling back and forth or like the humidifier cranked up super high trying to make the plants sweat it out yuh In any case, this is my new setup I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did Please make sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe so that you don't miss out on any future videos that I make Bye
