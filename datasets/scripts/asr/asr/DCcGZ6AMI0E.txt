 How you doing bike man for you finishing up our final break adjustment final assembly on our brake we installed our cable we got everything running nice and smooth we got our break on here we go for final break adjustment first thing you want to do is you want to get your payout I did the other side let me help you out with this side okay here comes one of them specialty tools this is one a 10 millimeter nut driver that fits right on to here wait what was that what a 10 millimeter nut driver okay square it's like a screwdriver for that this is one of them specialty tools yeah you can do it with your old good old fashion 10 millimeter but this kind of helps me a little bit because I'm just a professional and I have every tool under the sun but I can do it either way which way would you like the way that you guys do it okay here we go so we kind of want to like interpolate where this thing is going to fit this can fit you might want to get let me loosen this up a little bit so that way we're going to see it we can go you want to shoot it this way see how this can be moved in and out up and down okay so you got to find that happy medium of where to heck you want it now if your wheel is spinning this way you want the trailing edge because this would be the last part of the edge of the brake pad to hit you want that to hit first so that they don't squeal so badly this might take a couple of different times of trying it and and whatnot but you want it kind of tilted so that this hits first and you want it so that it'll hit on the rim as you can see here it's not that's going to be way too high are you getting that or kind of somewhere it's a little too high I got to come down a little bit the nice part about the nut drivers I can push it right up against the wheel as I'm going with that okay you can see how that's still a little high I got to come down with that take your time getting your brake pad adjustment on the money you don't want to mess up your rim not only your men you don't want to mess up that expensive tire you got on the back if it doesn't take long for it the brake pad to rub through your tire well now we're looking just a hair more down take your time get it right if it is worth it if at first you don't succeed try try try again or curse a little and try again I love that want to make it nice and straight bone that's looking pretty good on the middle of the rim trailing just hitting first I'm in good shape moving on to the next step now next step putting the cable on you might want to get one of these maybe you got something that looks something similar to it maybe you got whatever a big C clamp or wood clamp your buddies to hold this together hold it together on the rim while you're messing with the adjustable of the cable or you can get yourself a third hand and put that on the way I like that be careful the thing doesn't spring back and hit in the goon head all right so now this is going into here this is going into here now here we go the next step this is like we were talking about on this is a pretty fancy system you loosen up that set screw that's inside of that this is going to go into here like that hang on a second and you might need a millimeter maybe to hold on to that yeah let me just crank on this a little bit oh yeah now of course right about now if your buddies are holding that break in come on Jimmy get tired help I'm gonna let go all right I think I'm in good shape let me just check that one more time guys keep holding on make sure that Allen key is all the way in that little hole you can feel it going all right we're gonna leave it like that for a second let's take off our third hand you guys can let go now don't expect it to work straight out of the bone here let's go see what happens you know what else you're doing as you're wanking your brake operate is your starting to stretch out your cable so you might have to do that hole procedure all over again guys you can have to hold on again just to get it right now we can dial in on our break our not spring tension like we talked about on that break video on the installation now that our brake pads are nice and close we can dial in our brake pads a little bit more closer because everything is getting a little bit closer to the rim now now we can really fine tune it you know doing it one or two times is better than trying to think you're gonna get it done in one shot because a little bit persistent on this thing I'm gonna actually dial up that brake cable a little bit more but that's it that's looking pretty good you know now finishing off again I make it look I could do this for a living guys okay I'm gonna give myself a little bit there to be able to adjust a little bit here to adjust you got the other side is done we already set that when we put it on the first time now so that everybody understands and with your brake cable you are getting some of these babies these little guys little cable end aluminum cable ends let me show you how to put these on it makes everything so nice and neat boom boom I usually give it two little that's my trademark two little notches keeping your brake inside too eliminates the need for replacement all the time because it gets rusty and nasty get the other side I dropped it eliminates the need for corrosion keeping your bike inside doesn't the cable doesn't
