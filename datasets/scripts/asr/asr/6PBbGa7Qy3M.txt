 Some sort of leather cleaner. I just have this one. Yeah. It's some like Dollar Tree brand, but they work, so it doesn't really matter. You can have saddle cleaning stuff or whatever. It's just, I think, any leather thing will work because it's just leather. So, yeah. So just get a little saddle. I like to bend my flat out so I can just get those like that. Okay. And then I have my golets. These, and all I like to do is just rub them. So yeah, I like to get under here. It's flat right here. So now I'm going to turn my saddle around and yeah, that uses one. And my saddle stand is broken. My sister's saddle stand is broken. So yeah. I have a saddle stand. Okay. It's one of these. One of the e-hookings of the wall. And I don't have, that's my saddle stand. I don't have any like screws or anything. I'm putting into the wall. I keep forgetting I have this name played back here. So forget bullying. That's not my name. I don't know who the heck is this. But when I bought my saddle it came with that. Oops. Okay, whatever. Am I getting another one? Yep. I'm not going to clean this side. Okay, so that's how you clean your saddle. Now I'm going to get my stirrups and I'm going to show you how to clean your stirrups. So yeah. Okay. So hey, my sister's leather has my stirrups on it. And I just, but I do, I just paint them to spot where they get caught on my saddle stand. And I just wipe them down. There you go. Now I'm going to do the other one. So yeah, that's how you clean your saddle and your stirrups. I hope you liked it. If you liked it. And comment right in subscribe. I guess. Whatever you want to do. It's your choice. So comment right subscribe. And I would love. Love, love, love. Some video requests. So send those out. And yeah.
