 So today we're going to be doing part of our vintage bikes program and our theme for the year is the celebration of food. I came up with the idea that we would do an Anzac biscuit bake off. So today I've got some special famous shifts in the house. So it's a little bit of a master's shift afternoon. We've got five different recipes we're going to be put into the test and you lucky people are going to eat them for afternoon tea. We had five teams cooking different recipes, Alison from the Watson Kitchen bakery which is our local bakery. Our previous cook who is cooking up a recipe by Mark Couten, our federal member for Parliament. Jean and her sister Heather who have been cooking for a very long time and are beautiful cooks. Our day respite group is cooking today and of course me being Robert Young's activities officer. Anzac biscuits are etched into our history I guess. They made them for the soldiers and sent them over and we're still making them and now we don't just make them on Anzac day we make them all the time and we eat them and something that's enjoyed by everybody. Today was to bring back beautiful memories because I'm sure their mums would have made Anzac biscuit. Hopefully for them it's the smell of fresh biscuits that just bring back all those beautiful memories. Do you mean when are we in the bride she's taking my side? Each of the biscuits were judged on their colour their shape their taste and their crispness and the winning prize went to team women's weekly. The whole day today was an absolute success a lot of fun and a lot of enjoyment. Today we took out the challenge my team took out the challenge because the women's weekly never let you down. I've tasted a few of them and they're all beautiful. I should have won. I only hope to stir. I'm a stir.
