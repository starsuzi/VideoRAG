 Hi, I'm here today with BestCarpetValue.com. Today we're going to be talking about common household stains and how to remove them from your carpet tiles. With the busyness of everyday life, stains are really common, especially with children around. So today we're going to be talking about how to remove mustard from your carpet. First I'm going to apply the mustard just a little bit. Okay, the first step that you want to do is grab a clean cloth and grab as much of the mustard up as you can. I want to try to remove it all of the blob. Okay, once that's done, we're going to use this mixture. This mixture consists of one tablespoon of white vinegar, one tablespoon of discharging and two cups of warm water. So what we're going to do is we're just going to get a clean white cloth, put some solution on it, and we're going to apply it to your stain. And after you get some on here, you're going to want to let it sit for five minutes. Make sure it's covered in the solution. Okay, and after you've let it sit for five minutes, you're going to get a drop clean cloth and you're going to dab just to try to get it all up. You're going to want to start from the outside in. And if it doesn't come up the first time, you can repeat this as many times as needed until the stain is removed. As you can see, the stain is completely gone now. So that's how you're being bustered from your carpet towels. So for towels, if you cannot get the stain out, remember that these towels can be removed and replaced. So you can just pick up the one square that has the stain and replace it. Thank you for joining us today with bestcarpetvalue.com.
