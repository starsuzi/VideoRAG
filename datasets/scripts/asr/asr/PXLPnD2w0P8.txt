 I want to demonstrate the actual properties of EVEN and EVENT fabric. It's a direct venting waterproof material. We've got a swatch of it here in this cylinder and we've got a swatch of a very common laminated waterproof breathable on the other side. So we'll take some water, we're going to pour the water in the top, pour the water in the top, and you can see that both of them are waterproof. Neither's leaking water into the lower chamber. Still filled with air. And out of the back of each chamber we've got a hose attached to a pump. We're going to turn that pump on and watch to see which one is more breathable. It seems pretty dramatic and it is. And just to show you that this is all in the up and up I'm going to switch these pumps around, shut them off. Turn the pumps back on. Same result. This direct venting technology over here really keeps you dry and highly aerobic activities when it's when your garment is made from it. Perhaps the biggest story here is really how little internal air pressure it takes to actually get that thing to vent. And the other laminated. Even. It's a pretty big deal.
