 Hello everyone and welcome back to one month to another and it's Vanessa and it's Friday. So today's topic of the day is going to be how to clean your children's toys and I'm actually going to be showing four different ways that you can clean your children's toy just because there's a different range of toys from stuffed animals to electronic toys that have batteries in them and stuff that you can submerge underwater. So yeah guys okay so one of the first things you want to do is you want to sort your toys you want to make sure that you take out your electrical toys battery operated toys your plush soft toys and then toys that can be submerged. I have three three piles here and the second thing that you want to do is you want to sort of clear out a space where an area where you can do what you need to do clean your toys. So here I've started some not this one but this one is an electronic toy this one is to this also is this lights up so yeah so I have these over here and I cleaned my kitchen countertop because I do not have a lot of counter space as you can see I sort of put everything over there to the side right now and so yeah the second thing you want to have is something to clean your toys with and I have two reusable cloths these are new just because I don't want to I don't want to clean with something that I've been using for the kitchen or anywhere else because germs can harvest and for a long time and it's not you know these things just like sponges and stuff like that this is a new sponge just because I don't want to use my regular kitchen sponge because I don't usually your kitchen sponge does have a lot of amount of bacteria in it and you don't want to spread that on your children's toys so I have two new two new reusable cloths and one new sponge and then I have a little brush just in case you need to get any looks and crannies on anything and then I have two the two product two cleaning products I'm going to use is Dawn dishwasher dishwasher liquid detergent and the second is vinegar and what I've done here is I've made my own cleaning solution and it's one part vinegar one part water and I have some clean microfiber towels I'm going to be using to spread out my toys on so I've laid out two microfiber towels I filled up my sink with water and I did wash my sink prior to this and also the drain just because I don't want any germs that may be harboring in my drain getting on the toys because I would totally defeat the purpose so I'm going to take a little bit of my Dawn and put it in there I would say about half a tablespoon you don't want too much because then you're going to get half issues with rinsing it off I'm going to add some vinegar to that and that's because vinegar is a disinfectant okay so now I'm going to submerge these toys that I've selected to be safe to be submerge in water just random items not everything that he has of course because then it would be just too much to do at what it would have to do with a bathroom okay this actually lights up okay and then we have these okay so you just want to take your sponge and you could if they're really dirty you could sponge clean them if they're not really dirty just the rinse is good enough you could just look and stick in there probably for 10 minutes if you could get your brush if you see I don't know sometimes things have like crevices and make harbored dirty you could just scrub that off this is a teething toy or a little par that's been on the floor you know everything that's in the floor actually but like I said if it's not really dirty just let us sit in here for like 15 minutes okay so 15 minutes has passed I'm gonna release that dream okay guys another my items having rinsed off I'm gonna shake them out and put them on my towel and that's my helper over there so you guys option two is you get your equal parts vinegar and water spray them a reusable cloth and you just wipe down whatever item you feel that you don't want to submerge or to be honest this is the easiest method it would be my choice so just wipe them out and just let them dry and that'll kill all the germs on on your toys so yeah so that was a take on plastic toys toys that you can submerge in water or you can wipe down with a cloth now there are some toys that you cannot do that too so this is gonna be option three and option three is not really it's more to just kill the dust mites on your toys so this is what you're gonna do you're gonna get a plastic zip lock bag you're gonna put the toys in the zip lock bag and that's really weird right then you're gonna take these bear with me and you're going to put them into your freezer I know weird okay so yeah so you gonna want to leave them in your freezer for three to five hours just to kill anything on it and that's option three all right guys so I'm gonna load my fluffy stuff into my fluffy toys into the wash machine and I'm gonna add two tablespoons of it's washing soda with baking soda mix of equal parts I'm gonna start that and put it on delicate so the load is finished and I'm gonna put these in the dryer so I'm gonna put these to dry for the exception of this because of the hard things on it so yeah I'm just gonna put on normal dry so here's the finished product nice clean and fluffy even the white one even the older bear so yeah oops I have mr rat over here so yeah guys now that all my toys are clean I just wanted to say that I do not profess or claim in any way that this is the right way to clean my toys this is just my choice and something that I wanted to share with you guys and I mean most importantly my favorite way is to wash soft toys on the washing machine and dry them in the dryer and just spray them down with um spray wipe them down with my vinegar solution and let them dry off just because vinegar is non-toxic it doesn't leave any residue um it also kills 99% of bacteria yes vinegar kills 99% of bacteria it kills 82% of mold and 80% of germs and or viruses so I would recommend cleaning your toys once a month unless of course your child you know makes a mess and gets food all over it or poo you know it could happen or vomit you know then I would clean it you know right away or if your child is sick if your child is sick and had a cold or anything that was related to something that you know that they that is catching your child can re-infect themselves again so I would suggest cleaning toys definitely after your child has a bout of illness so yeah guys I hope you enjoyed and see you guys next Friday bye thanks for watching bye you
