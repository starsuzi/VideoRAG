 Hi guys today I'm helping mom make money buddy. Yay! Okay so what you need is a combination of cornchecks, rice checks or chocolate checks. We're using cornchecks and rice checks and we are going to get melted in the microwave the semi-sweet chocolate chips and we're actually going to throw in some Reese's peanut butter chips with peanut butter butter and then we'll get that going and come back. Okay so we got our butter and our chocolate and peanut butter all melted we're going to go ahead and put in our vanilla extract quickly here. We'll pour that in. Share! Okay alright mix that up a little bit and then we are going to divide ours into our separate bowls and mix them just because I don't have a big enough bowl for a double batch. That looks pretty good and then we will put on the powdered sugar and get them coated. Alright hold on honey let's do this first. Okay let's try that. Nope not yet. Somebody's excited to put the sugar on can you tell? Oh the chocolate out there. Can my dad do? Yep right there too. I think we got it all? Yeah but yeah. Okay so let me do it. You can actually the recipe calls for dumping the top of the cover cereal into like a gallon baggie and adding the powdered sugar and then just shaping it up. I'm actually out of gallon baggies so we're just going to pour it in the bowl and slowly start around when we get to that point. Okay so can you dump about half of that bowl in there? Actually let's start a little bit and then we'll sit up. There you go. Thanks. How does that taste? Yum. Come over here. Alright hold on. I'm not ready for the next part. Do like some of the other ones. Oh my god. Oh my god. I think that's going to eat them all. Yep. What about us? Do we get any? Because we made them? Yeah. Oh okay. That's good. No. Alright can you pour a little bit more in this one? I don't go. My hands are shaking. Oh it's like snowing huh? Alright hold on there. Okay. That looks pretty cover Bailey. Yeah. What do you think? I think so. We can go onto the next bowl here. Alright add some powdered sugar to that. Shake it shake it. Shake it. Oh no. It's snowing. Alright let's start with that. And this is our favorite. These are one of our favorites. These isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. You can use this for a general Halloween treat. We're going to get our Halloween balls out don't we? Yeah.
