 Hi, welcome to my home, welcome to Girl Talk With Carol. This is the totally unauthorized video about Birchbender's pancakes because I happen to love the product and my daughter is a big part of that company. So what is it? It's an organic gourmet pancake company and it's incredible. You take these little adorable containers, you fill up water to the fill line, you shake, put it on a hot griddle and I swear by the time your coffee is brewed your pancakes are ready. It's incredible. Now that could feed 100 guy or a husband and wife. This feeds the whole family. They come in these amazing flavors, six grains cinnamon, white chip macadamia nuts, chocolate chip, ginger, gluten free. It's so good and so easy and so delicious and so helpful and organic and I'm going to show you some cute pictures of the cute couple and some delicious looking pancakes. If you want to know more, you should go to biPancakes.com and very proud of a matlacase for figuring out that biPancakes.com was still available. The company is really Birchbenders, so birchbenders.com too. You can get them at whole foods right now in the Boulder area as lots of other stores and online. So they make great gifts and they make great really fast pancakes. The world's first micro pancakeery. Thank you.
