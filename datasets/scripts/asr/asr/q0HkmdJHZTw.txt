 Hi everyone, it's Lorraine Elliott from Not Quite No Jellor and today we are cooking with my mom. So what are we cooking? Curry path today. My favorite. Yeah. First of all, fry two and a half cups of onions in oil until they get really soft. Then add in some curry powder. We use about three or four tablespoons of curry powder but we really like it spicy and strong. Then add in your beef. This is 570 grams of minced beef. Then add in your diced potatoes. You're going to add two and a half cups of potatoes. Just add in some water and let it simmer. The potatoes take a while to cook so it may take up to 25 minutes to cook. Cut out some rounds with a pastry cutter or you can use a cup or a bowl like my mom does. And you're going to fill this pastry with a teaspoon of the filling. And crimp the edges shut and you want to make sure that they're shut properly because you don't want them opening up while you're frying. And then all you have to do is deep fry them and these are so delicious when they're freshly fried. I hope you like this recipe. Thanks for watching.
