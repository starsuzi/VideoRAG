 Hey YouTubers, I'm going to show you how to do Parmesan crisps or potato chips crackers, whatever you want to call them. And there's only two ingredients. One tablespoon of flour and one and a half cups of laboriously grated Parmesan cheese, not the stuff in the can, but the actual cheese itself. I mean, I've done it with other sides of the thing, but I want to have a powder texture. And so, and then you just take a spoon, do little piles. This isn't the first video I was inspired by this lady who had done this, a video on this. And almost tastes like cheeses. So I'm using what's left on this parched paper or whatever the heck you call it. Parched, parched, parched. There we go. Can't think straight when you're making a video. That or it's always a good excuse. Oh well. Yeah, that's one way to do it. So, and you put it in the oven, 350 degrees for 15 minutes. There we go. There. And once finished, you'll end up with this. And can you get the way it is? Hmm. Or try it and it'll do. Hmm. Really good. Two ingredients. One tablespoon of flour. One and a half cups of grated parmesan.
