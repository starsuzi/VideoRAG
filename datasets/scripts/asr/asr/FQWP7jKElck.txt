 Okay, we're waterproofing a T-shirt. Now as you can see I've covered up part of this T-shirt with a piece of fabric and I've then sprayed this surrounding area with ray and rain to waterproof it. Then I've gone ahead and removed the piece of fabric to expose the unprotected part of the shirt. Notice what happens when I pour some red wine over the shirt. The unprotected area immediately absorbs the wine and as well on the way to becoming a very hard to remove stain. It just soaks it up like a sponge but on the area that I've sprayed the wine was not absorbed. I can then go ahead and simply brush that off or even better if it's wine or something similar that can stain my fabric. I can soak it up with an absorbent towel. Let's try it again. This is the same shirt. You can see the stained area and now I'll pour some more wine over the area of sprayed with the ray and rain. It beads and sits on top. It's not soaking into the fabric at all. I mop it up easily and I can just go over it again to get every last bit. I gave this shirt two light sprays and allowed it to dry in between. Drying time is quite fast and we recommend that two light sprays is actually better than one heavy spray.
