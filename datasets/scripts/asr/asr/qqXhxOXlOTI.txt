 Instead of putting, so good and so many flavors to choose from. Let's try chocolate. Step 1. Measure one cup of milk. Add it to the bowl. Add another cup of milk. Add it to the bowl. That makes two cups of milk in the bowl. Two. Open the instant pudding. Open the side. Then pull the packet out. This packet is easy to rip, but you could use kitchen chairs instead. Three. Pour the instant pudding into the bowl. Four. Set the timer for two minutes. Go to 10 and then back to 2. Five. Use the wire whisk to beat the mixture. After a while, it'll look like this. Keep stirring until the bell rings. Six. Wait until the bell rings. Then stop stirring. And pour the pudding into the small bowls. Hmm, chocolatey. What flavor will you make?
