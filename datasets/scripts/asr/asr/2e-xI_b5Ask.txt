 Hey guys it's Warren here and I'm going to show you how you can whip up a pancake batter mix in literally seconds. I'll also include some links at the end of the video on more of my pancake recipes by Sweet and Savory. Firstly take yourself a protein shakeup. Then add 300 ml of milk, crack in one egg and add 125 grams of plain flour. Now place the lid back on your protein shakeup and give it a good old shake until the ingredients are combined. When your batter mix is smooth then in a hot non-stick large frying pan that's been lightly greased pouring your batter. And simply cook your pancakes as you would normally and this recipe is enough to make four pancakes. Now if you loved the look of this recipe remember to give this video a thumbs up and I'll see you again on Sunday for my next video remember to subscribe to be one of the first to see it and also remember to check out my other pancake recipes here.
