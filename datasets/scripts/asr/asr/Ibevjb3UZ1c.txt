 Hello, Kia ora! Welcome back to another eye can't be bothered cooking recipe. Today I'm going to make Ambrosia which is a really simple thing to do. Probably a hard attack in a bowl because it's mostly cream. Most people I think that I've seen they've made it more with yogurt and fruit and a little less of the marshmallow and cream. I've kind of gone the other way. Anyway here's how I just dump the ingredients together and make it. Enjoy! So here's what you're going to need. Some marshmallows, mine of course, are gluten-free and some yogurt. I'm just using, I don't even have measurements, I'm just using two little potions of yogurt and I'm using about 300ml of cream which maybe is about a cup and a half. I don't know, I'm guessing. And a tin of fruit. This is what I've got at the moment. If you make it with boys and berries that gives it a really cool colour but that's all you need.
