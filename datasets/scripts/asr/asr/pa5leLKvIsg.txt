 Hi, today I'm going to make a brief video to show you how to get rid of aphids on any kind of garden plant. My in particular will be rose bushes. Using a few simple products such as a bug pump sprayer, disc soap and water. If you have less plants you need to spray, you could use a small sprayer bottle with about a tablespoon to two of disc soap. Fill the rest with water and shake and start spraying. If you look closely in the video you could actually see the aphids on the plant. Eventually if you don't take care of this, this could possibly kill the whole plant. It starts removing all the nutrients and strum the plant as you can see the leaves are starting to look glazed and eventually crinkle and fall off. Okay, we have the soap and water ready to go in the pump sprayer. We're ready to spray the plant. This will dehydrate the insects so they will die off. You might possibly have to repeat this process in a few days if you still have an infestation. But this will work with almost no cost at all. Thanks for watching folks.
