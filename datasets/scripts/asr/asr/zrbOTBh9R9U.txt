 This is a leaf from a rubber tree. The one that I have is the matte kind. And so I put the leaf in water like this for about three weeks now and this is what it looks like. So I took this from a mature rubber tree and the dry part and the dry part of the leaf over here. It was the leaf was like that when I got it. So yeah. So all I did was just take the closest I made the closest cutting as possible to the branch and for about three weeks it didn't show any signs of growth and they just in the past few days the roots started coming out like this out of the stem like crazy and yeah and it has a few cracks that it's developed like on the side over here and then we've got another crack going over on this side now as you can see. So yeah anyone who has a rubber tree wants to propagate it but isn't sure how to do it you can it looks like you can do it from a single leaf cutting and I'm gonna put this in soil once the roots grow out a bit more and then I will see what happens.
