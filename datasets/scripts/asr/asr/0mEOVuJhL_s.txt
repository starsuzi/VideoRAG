 You know there's nothing like the charm and old world beauty of mercury glass in your own home. Hi, I'm Jules and I'm going to show you how quick and easy it is to make foam mercury glass out of jars like this for a lovely display in your home. All you need is old unused clean glassware from around the home or even browse through second-hand or thrift shops for old glassware and mason jars. This is such a great way to upcycle old glassware. You will also need 50% water with 50% white vinegar in a spritzer bottle, cling film, masking tape, paper towel and mirror effect spray paint. Okay, so let's get this fast and simple process started. Cover the outside of the glassware with cling film using masking tape at the top of the glass to prevent any over spray as you only need the inside of the glass painted. Spray the inside of the glassware with one light coat of paint and let it sit for 30 seconds. Then lightly spritz with your vinegar water mix. You'll immediately see the paint randomly pull away from the glass. Then lightly dab up any excess liquid with your paper towel. This will also add to the overall effect. Now that you've completed the first coat, allow it to dry and then repeat two or three times until you've reached the desired look. Once dry, remove the masking tape and cling film to reveal the beautiful mercury glass you've just created. I'm so pleased with my results and of course it's such a great way to upcycle old unwanted glassware and bring a charming sparkle to your home. Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
