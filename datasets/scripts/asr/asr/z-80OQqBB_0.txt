 Hi, I am Mark Bauer, Master Chef at the International Cainery Centre. Today in the events kitchen I'd like to show you how to make a French rock four dressing. In order to make rock four dressing, you will need four ounce of rock four, one cup of sour cream, a quarter cup of white wine vinegar and just a half a teaspoon of Tabasco. The water is just to consistency. In order to assemble the French rock four dressing, I put my rock four, I crush it, I crush the rock four with my whisk and add some white wine vinegar just to loosen it up so that I can mix it. Once my rock four is crumbled up in tiny little pieces, I can add my sour cream. Whisk until it homogenizes. The dressing is too thick as it is. Now you can add water to consistency. I'll start first probably with a quarter cup of water and we'll see what it looks like. So that consistency changes depending on what kind of cream you use. Now the consistency is right, we added the water. I added about half a cup of water to this. I will now finish with just a drop of Tabasco. Just a drop or two. That's enough to give it a kick. Whisk it. More salt to it. The rock four is very salty but I added so much sour cream and vinegar and a drop of water. It's the most salt. That's ready to go for a putero salad or salad dressing that to you. This has been Mark Bauer and that's how you make French rock four dressing.
