 Throughout the week, we've been sharing our holiday treats, Leslie on tap this morning. Yeah, it's not supposed to look like that. It's a whole story here. So what is this? OK, so this, it's like I didn't want to bake it. I've been busy, so I didn't want to make anything, but my family was all freaking out. OK, this is what I wanted to do. This was Plan A. This is my favorite Christmas thing. Well, here's the Safeway wrapper. Oh, thank you. It's Christmas cake. OK, yeah, from Safeway. But you wanted to make some of that. I love that. So this is the last. So serious. Well, I made it and then Safeway packaged it for me. OK, so that's really my favorite. OK, so that's what you want to do. But my family is all freaking out. Because you need to make something. You're ready to make something. So they all got together and they sent me this recipe and I'm going to make you guys dry. So this is Artichoke dip. OK, so you think that's OK, right? Is that too much for your jared? That's a lot. Why me? I can't do this. How does it smell? It's got, it's like vinegar or something. So I thought it smelled like a barn. But why are we rubbing rude? No, no, it didn't work out. I'm telling you right now. This did not work out. So it's Artichoke dip. Too much, too much. That's OK. Is it edible? Yeah, first I'll make well, say that bad, but the vinegar. But there's no vinegar in there. So here's what happens. What? That's like all that I can taste in this vinegar. Oh, huh. Oh, my gosh. It's hard. OK, so like it's gone. I'm not trying to be rude here. It's OK. I agree with you. Oh, I totally agree with you. Oh. It's Artichoke dip, but something went terribly wrong. OK, so first of all, I'm doing that. Oh, oh, oh. It's vinegar, it's your first. Yeah, there's no vinegar. There's no vinegar. Do you think something is off? Like do you think maybe the Artichokes are off? Well, OK, I didn't have a lemon, so I just cut up an orange and put that in there. And then I didn't know what spice is to put in. So I put celery salt in it. You know, and see, this is where the little bits of chemistry play. Things didn't combine properly. So how are you enjoying it, Amber? It burns. It was watering here. It didn't look like there's vinegar. But there's no vinegar, so I don't get it. It burns. I don't get it. It's just to make value there. So the recipe's on the head to global news. Don't see it. It's not hungry. The recipe.
