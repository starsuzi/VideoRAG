 Hi, I'm Dennis Mangregona, chef at Porter's Net Country Club. Today we have tips for how to use the spring form pan. Materials needed, aluminum foil, the spring form. Make sure it closes. Tip 1, keep the sticker on the bottom so you know which is the bottom of the pan. I always get confused. So that's why I need the sticker on, so I know that's the bottom. When making cheesecakes, you always have the batter run out. Foil, bottom side up. Take your pan. And you've got a great seal. Another tip, foil. When you fill it up with your batter, place it right down the middle of the foil. And just crank and turn. So this way when you put it in a water bath, the water won't get in.
