 Hey guys, I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate syrup by my lo. So let's get started. First is we're going to get our my lo. Are you sure you have any of my lo? So I'm going to get mine. And also be sure to ready your cup and spoon. So let's start. The first thing is we're going to open this my lo. And just get my taste. Mmm, yummy. A little bit. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. So we just want to get it a little bit. So we just, if you want to do many syrup, we use tree cups. And we're going to use a piece of my lo. Maybe four. So I'm just going to do a tree's cup of that. Next step is to have it a little bit of water. And we're just going to spin it. If it's actually smooth, it's okay. And if it's not, just add more a little bit of water until it kills smooth. Mine is being so good. So time to taste chocolate syrup. It's a good little thing. Mmm. The yummy chocolate. You can buy marshmallows and give it a stop here. So yummy. Thanks for watching. Bye.
