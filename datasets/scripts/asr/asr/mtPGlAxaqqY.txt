 Hello everybody. It's Naisle and Regan and what we're doing today is we are grinding coffee beans. We're trying to make them nice and fine. So we couldn't find anything in the house to do it. We didn't have a grinder, not right? We didn't have a grinder. So what we're doing now is we're using the magic bullet to grind them. So what we do is we take the little cup. We put our beans in a little cup and Regan's going to hold a little cup for me. We're going to pour the beans in. Oh you put on any ones with my fairie again. Okay so what we have is we have Starbucks Christmas blend coffee beans. Yeah yeah okay so what we're going to take next is our flat blade. Yeah, a flat blade from the magic bullet. So we put it on top. We screwed it on. Isn't that right? Yeah, we still want the magic. Yeah, then we take our magic bullet. Not right? That's yours and we put it on top. That's ready. Good night. It's for like 10 seconds. One and then it begins to get nice and fine. We give it a little shake. You want to do give it a little shake Regan? Yeah. We put it back on again and then we put it back on again. It's for like 10 seconds. It's for like 10 seconds. What happened? Back in the noise. Yeah, that makes all the noise. So what we're left with then guys. It's a nice fine blend on the bean. Alright. It can't see. You can't see. Smell it. What's that? Coffee beans. Coffee beans. Okay.
