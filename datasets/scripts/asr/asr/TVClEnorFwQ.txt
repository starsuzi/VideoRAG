 Hello and welcome to Garbinga 58 North and this video I'm going to be repotting up my new daily up hand here. So I bought this just the other day you can see it's still in the original pot that I came in and I'm wanting this to flower some along and it should do, daily is really good for that. If you get a daily that's already flowering in June, you know what I keep flowering until October to be honest or even November because daily is they tend to be late flowering plants so it's actually quite hard to get them to flower in the early summer but if you can get one from the shop where they've obviously been growing on for a long time it's already in flower that you can expect that it will keep flowering the whole summer and into autumn as long as you keep daily heading the plant there's anything that really stops these from growing if the cold weather when the frost comes and as it's middle of May we're going to have several months now of warm weather so it's a perfect time for me to be potting it up. So the variety I've gone for this year is the the brand name is Grand Alia and it's a dark red variety and Grand Alia is just a brand name basically but it's a hybrid daily. So I quite like this one because you can see it's got a really lovely kind of red color to it. This one unfortunately seems to be reverting a little bit back to the more wild form so as you can see from the picture this is what it should look like and indeed some of the flowers are very similar and that one's what it should look like but some of them aren't completely double so that's a double flower there's nothing in the middle it's just loads loads petals but some of them are verting back to a more kind of wild form which is still quite pleasant to be honest I think that's still quite a nice flower there but yeah so there's probably going to vary as it goes for some of them are completely double like this one other ones are going to be much more simple just have a few petals and have have the middle section like a normal plant so yeah I'm quite happy with the color of it so all I'm going to do before I plant it into a bigger pot is I'm going to cut off some of the dead heads so there's a few in the middle here so I'm just going to cut them off and that will encourage more flowers to be produced as the summer comes along so you can see there there's a couple of old heads that needs to be taken out and with regular dead heading as I say this should keep flowering for many many months if you don't dead head it regularly then these will slow down the flower as well but the very good flower is the dead ears so I think that's probably enough dead heading for now there's not too many in there as you can see there's quite a lot of new shoots coming on it you can see that all of these are the more stubborn ones even a few aphids that I'm going to have to keep an eye on the aphids but yeah you can see after the after the flower comes out you then get a couple of more shoots coming up and that will just continue and these lower down shoots here these are all growing up so on these are finished flowering they'll be more coming up and it'll just have a good succession of flowers so I'm going to take it out the pot now it's only got one stem this one some of them have two or three stems coming from the tuba and some of them have big tubas of the ones have very small tubas so we'll have a look see what it looks like in the pot so it's got a good root system by the looks of things you can see it's not too pop-up bound but certainly could do with a bit more space it's got a very good structure of roots can't see any tubas and a lot of them don't actually have massive tubas some of the dailyers have really big tubas almost like potatoes in that but the one I grew last year which was similar to this certainly didn't have any tubas and this one looks like it might not have any either not only large ones anyway so the reason I'm currently in this big pot is I need it to flower or some along and the nutrients levels in this small container that it was in before are going to be almost completely depleted and the more root space you give a plant the faster and bigger and more vigorous that will grow so I'm just going to start off I'm going to get the original polychemy and I'm just going to make a little bit of a hole by the same kind of sizes as this pot was make sure it's going to have enough space a little bit more star possum there so there we are that looks almost correct take a little bit more out mixer it's in the center make sure it's deep enough and the compost I've used is a is a very rich pea-based compost for the mixture of peat and compost materials and it's very rich just and ideally it's like a very rich compost that they're very hungry feeders they also have very thirsty plants it's the deep-plenty of water and this this compost will hold a lot more moisture for them so it's very well I've also added quite a lot of pearlite as you can see from the white pits in the compost and that's just going to help with the drainage it also means it's very loose makes you can see it's really loose and the the roots are going to grow through that very well there's not going to be anything impeding the root growth so I'm just going to continue now filling this up compacting it very slightly so when I pull out this plastic pot it doesn't completely collapse and what this does is it means that how I'm perfectly sized holding the middle of the pot the second to pot this straight into and it's going to be the exact same size as what it needs so it makes it very easy that's quite a quite a handy way of repotting some plants so there we are just pack down a little bit carefully remove this one just give it a little twist really out like that so as you can see it's now perfectly shaped whole whole just the same as the pot size that it came from so I can just pop this plant straight in so I just lift it up order by the stem make sure no leaves go in the soil as you can see it fits absolutely perfectly so I'm just going to further push it down just to make sure it's all all in there correctly but maybe time a bit more on the top because I think it needs to be a little bit deeper there the top there to some bit composting still exposed I'm only going to cover that by sent to me because I don't want to bury it in the leaves and I don't want anyone to bury much of the stem so there we are so that's an absolutely choose pot far bigger than you actually need I would if somebody was putting this in a pile would say that's far too big for it but because I know this is going to grow in the horse I'm along and I'm going to be feeding it loads hopefully it's going to be a really sunny position it's to put on a lot of growth I'm hoping by the end of the summer this will completely fill the pot and give me a great display so that's my daily of plant planted up when I give you guys updates as the summer goes on and it will be interesting to see how big this plant will get by September up to up to time
