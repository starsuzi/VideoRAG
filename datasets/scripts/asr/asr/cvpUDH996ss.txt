 Today I will be on the television and I will be there because I'm growing vanilla in the greenhouses. We are working with a group of growers on vanilla and the most important is to get them to flower. That's what we do here. And when you have flowers you can pollinate them by hand. And then you have to wait at least six months for the pots to grow and then you need to cure those pots and then you get the black vanilla you everybody is so fond of. Well that's what we do basically here in this greenhouse and that is what is going to show what will be shown on that television.
