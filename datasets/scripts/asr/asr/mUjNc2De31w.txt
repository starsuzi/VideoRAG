 Greetings Gastronauts, this is Keith Cooks, I'm Keith and today I'm going to do a much neglected and almost totally forgotten, classic British dish, liver and onions. Actually I'm doing liver and bacon with onion gravy but you know it's more or less the same thing and it's utterly wonderful and really cheap and really super nutritious. A lot of people think they don't like awful or organ meat because it does sound a bit gross but you know if you're going to kill an animal to eat it then you should really eat the whole thing so it is part of nose to tail eating and liver if it's done right is an absolute treat so let's do it. Now ingredients for liver and bacon with onion gravy, I've got about 200 grams of lambs liver, three ratchets of smoked bacon, three medium small medium onions, nearly half liter of beef stock made up from an oxo cube or a wheel on cube and we'll also need some salt, pepper and flour and oil and a little bit of some bobs. So I got lambs liver because it's it's pretty mild and pork and certainly beef liver is much stronger and some people like to soak it in milk for an hour or two before they use it which kind of modulates the flavour a bit and that's fine but you don't really need to do that with lambs liver and yeah I said it was economical this from Tesco. I got just over half a kilo and the price per kilo is £2.40 so the price of this pack was £1.28 which is and that's the regular price that's not discounted or anything which is pretty sensational for something that is so good for you and the other point about liver is it's frequently people don't like it because it's tough as old boots and that's because it's overcooked and it's very easy to overcook it it doesn't take much cooking at all so I'm going to spend about half an hour making the gravy and then add the other bits so yeah so I've got a good glug of oil in the frying pan and that's on medium heat and uphill the onions and half them and then you just want to slice them quite thinly. The majors want to cook really gently and slowly for about half an hour so they're nice and caramelised and while that's going on you can put your veg I'm going to do mashed potato with chive and a bit of cabbage boiled and yeah because once this gets to the end you won't have any time to mess about with cooking vegetables okay we're starting to get some action after about 15 minutes yeah you know you can't rush caramelisation it does take a long time so be patient all right here's me and the ends they look well there is done as I want them to be so now I need some flour flour and just stir in as much as you can get absorbed in the oil you can let that cook for a minute or two and you know the flour will burn slightly then give it a deeper nuttier kind of flavour and then add the stock and let that cook for about five minutes and that you know the flour will make it thicken up and it'll be wonderful okay there's my nice thick gravy and we'll have a little taste hmm that's nice it's not exactly what I want but it's flavour will change when it gets mixed with the liver and onions so I need to wash that out and now I'll use it to fry the liver and bacon okay clean frying pan more oil on coming up to medium heat and is our liver so all you want to do is slice it and get rid of any bits that have tubes in like that bit because that's not nice to eat okay and you just want to dredge them in a bit of flour and pop them in the pan and they'll only want about three or four minutes each side and now you want to cut the bacon into strips about the same width and length that you did for the liver now you want to wash this goo off your fingers okay that's one side you can see there's liquid coming out and so just flip them over and I'll turn the heat down a little bit and then pop the bacon in okay and when they all look kind of sealed all over we'll just put the gravy back in the pan turn the heat right down and just like that cook for about five minutes for the flavours to melt okay let's have a little taste Sim Magnifique that doesn't need anything added to it that is absolutely gorgeous so I'll just chuck it on a plate and we can do the proper taste test okay that right here we go proper Brit no messing food and it's lovely so the liver is tender and bit juicy it's not pink if you like it pink you can do it that way just barely cook it but I like it a bit more cooked than that and this is just exactly right so yeah it's a shame that you hardly ever see this these days I've seen it in a few you know very down to earth cafes where it's wonderful and you might see a pastiche of it popping up in a fainting restaurant but you know in the mainstream because it does actually involve a little bit of skill to do but wow not much it's just care and attention and it's fabulous and that's that I hope you enjoyed it now please do the usual likes shares comments subscriptions donations patronage all that good stuff or just some of it and thank you for watching and see you next time
