 Hi, Kristi in the Rated Kitchen. Today I want to share a recipe that uses our Rated Quick Mixed Pound Cake. It's an Ambrosia dessert and I'm going to use the toasted coconut Quick Mixed Pound Cake. They're really easy to mix up. Let me show you how to make the pound cake and then we'll come back and do the filling for it. So all you need is a stick of melted butter, two eggs and a fourth a cup of water. You just stir in your pound cake mix. You'll want to preheat your oven to 350 degrees and once you have that mixed together you'll need a loaf pan. This is the Rated Stoneware Loaf pan. These you don't need to pre-season. If you're using a metal or glass one you will want to spray that with some cooking spray. And we're going to put this in the oven and bake it for about 50 to 55 minutes or until a toothpick in the middle comes out clean. So the pound cake has baked. I let it cool in the loaf pan for about 10 minutes and I flipped it out and now it's completely cool. And we're just going to slice it. You could leave it in half inch slices or I'm going to put it in these cute little mason jars. And this is the Rated 6 inch bread knife. Cut through that crusty outer core and I'm just going to cube this. So I'm going to set that aside and I'm going to make my filling and broja filling. So you just need two cups of prepared vanilla pudding. One 12 ounce can of mandarin oranges that have been drained. A half cup of mini marshmallows. And you just blend that. And now what I'm going to do is put them in these cute little mason jars. We're going to put a layer of pound cake on the bottom. And spoon the orange and vanilla marshmallow mixture on top of that. And then put another layer of pound cake. And then to tap that off with a dollop of whipped topping. And I say back a little orange slice. And that's a quick delicious dessert using the Rated Quick Mix toasted coconut pound cake. Check out more recipes on our website at www.RatedQuickMixRespees.com. You
