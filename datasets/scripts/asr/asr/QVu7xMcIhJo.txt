 How to Make an Egg Cream. This classic New York drink, which contains neither eggs nor cream, will take you back in time to marble counters and soda shops. You will need A third of a cup of very cold milk A large soda fountain glass Two thirds of a cup of cold celtzer water Two tablespoons of chocolate syrup And a long handled metal mixing spoon. Step 1. Pour the milk into a large soda fountain style glass. Step 2. Slowly pour the celtzer into the center of the glass. This will produce a thick white foam at the top of the glass. If you like your egg cream extra creamy and rich, you can increase the amount of milk used to two thirds of a cup. Step 3. Using a long handled metal spoon, add the chocolate syrup by sliding it carefully into the glass. Try not to disturb the foam. Step 4. With your spoon, gently mix the chocolate into the drink. Try to mix it in without stirring the foam. Mixing the chocolate into the milk before adding the celtzer water can make the foam brown instead of white. Step 5. Serve your egg cream in a fountain glass without a straw. Take a sip and enjoy this New York classic.
