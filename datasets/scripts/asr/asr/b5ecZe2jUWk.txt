 Hi and welcome to episode number 231 with WhatsFuchar.com. In today's episode we're making pickled pork. The difference between pickled pork and ham is that although the meat is cured, it is not pressed or smoked. This is really easy to make at home and is suitable for roasting and absolutely outstanding on pizza or as cold cuts on gourmet sandwiches or rolls. Having been pickled the shelf life is also approximately 4 times longer than regular pork. You can find the full printable recipe by clicking the on screen link at the end of this video. To start place the water, salt, pizza, sugar, salt, pepper, whole all spice and whole coriander in a pot. Bring this to a boil, simmer for 10 minutes, then quick-chall the curing brine by placing the pot in a sink of cold water. While the brine cools, trim the excess fat from the meat. I'm using pork leg but you can also use shoulder, rump or any cut of your choice. Cut the pork along the grain into manageable pieces, remembering that you're going to slice it thinly when cooked and the larger the pieces, the more difficult this will be to do. Place the pork in a large container and pour the cooled curing brine over the pork. Place a plate on top of the pork to keep it submerged in the brine and place the lid on the container. Place the container in your refrigerator and allow this to cure for 24 hours per 25 mm or 1 inch of meat thickness. My pieces are 50 mls thick or 2 inches so they will cure for 48 hours. After the curing time is up, remove the pork from the brine. To cook the pork, wrap each piece in foil, place the packages in a large roasting pan and bake them for 45 minutes plus 15 minutes extra for every pound in weight. Remove the pork from the oven and allow it to stand for 5 minutes before slicing, if you're serving it hot. If you're using it as cold cuts, allow it to cool completely before slicing thinly.
