 Hi everyone! I wanted to show you how the first set of duck farts cupcake soaps came out. I just love these little elephant guys. I try to do like a mallard duck type color and it looks sort of like mardi kura colors but it is just a little bit different has a little bit more green in it. Some are a little bit more purple though. I don't know I tried. Anyways I have the little the dambos and the tiggers and lying kings and they're I've got a bunch more to do. I just soaked my first batch of snow fairy and I'm going to be making some more cupcake soaps with these with all these guys and I've got some more little elephants in there but I want to they're gonna be a little bit different than these. They won't be quite as plain. I want to put like a frosted cupcake top and then insert the embeds on top and so it looks more like a little cake rather than just the cupcake base but this is the first set. I'm going to be doing a second set because I did get what did mate ducking beds for the cupcake soaps. They're going to be little ducky embeds made of co-process so all right I hope you like these guys. See you later. Bye bye!
