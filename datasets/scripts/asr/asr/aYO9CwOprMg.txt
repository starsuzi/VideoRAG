 Hey guys, so I'm in the school parking lot and I'm about to leave but it is so hot outside. My car says 102 which I highly doubt actually is like 90 degrees but it's still so hot but I'm going shopping today I have a lot to do but I'll explain later because I need to get out of the school traffic. Okay so I'm at the container store now and I need to go get some drawers for my desk because I'm converting my desk to a like a makeup place as well so like along with my computer so that's why I'm here and the bad thing is like the closest container store is like 20 minutes away and you have to go in the highway and everything so on my way back home it's going to be like rush hour and it's going to be so busy and I'm just not looking forward to that at all so yeah that's my deal right now. Okay so I'm also going to organize my closet so I'm looking for hangers and stuff too but guys you know what I hate okay so when I'm here in the store and you're like I know what I'm getting like I know where it is I don't need help and so you go in the store and you try looking for it but you can't find it and a worker comes up to you and you're like hey do you need help finding anything like no I'm okay because you know where you're going but then you keep looking and you're like I literally have no idea where this is and you just wander around the store so many times and you see the work of the ass you like 10 times and you're like yeah I just don't know where it is and you end up asking them and you're like I feel so stupid. That's kind of what happened to me except I ended up finding it literally the front of the store where I walked in I'm done. I need to go get converse but I don't know if they have a journey is where I am right now. I just parallel parked perfectly and then once I got in the parking spot realizing that I'm not a lot of park there wow I was pretty proud of myself too but no I literally just went in circles trying to find a parking spot because it's one of those like shopping centers where it's just like one row of parking and there's never parking so I'll still drive around for like 10 minutes even though I probably could have just walked but it's fine but yeah journey is over here somewhere like oh wow I'm actually so far I'm now going to Walmart to get a closet organizer because I'm organizing my closet tonight after about two hours I'm finally going home I got a lot of stuff and I'll show you guys once I get home and get everything out of my car because there's a ton of stuff my Trump too from Walmart and yeah my car's a mess right now should I attempt backing up into the actual garage and then tomorrow morning I can just let's go should I do it? I might end up really bad. I'm in here backwards it's so weird okay friends I changed I'm in cozy clothes and I'm ready to go except we'll be eating dinner soon but I got an announcement to tell you guys I'll tell you guys after I show you guys what I got so I went to the container store but it's for my makeup and it's just gonna go on my desk and I'm gonna go for more like a modern kind of look on my desk that's like all clear and everything like I don't know how to explain but that's what I'm gonna do for that and then I bought two of these pencil containers I guess but I'm gonna use them for my makeup brushes and these were six dollars and that was $14 maybe? Yeah $14 and I went to journeys and got my converse because the guys kind of seen my other vlogs I explained or I told you guys that we went on a little trail and it was super muddy and I got my shoes ruined so I will not be wearing these out in the mud anytime soon because look how clean and white they are and then from Walmart since I am organizing my closet and I want to add my doors back on instead of the curtains because the curtains are getting really gross I use like these really gross hangers from the cleaners that are just paper and wire and they are not very like durable and long lasting so I decided to buy some hangers and these are like the velvet kind I got two because they come with 30 so I have 60 hangers and then I bought two of these white baskets to go in this closet organizer that I'll show you now so here's the organizer that I bought it was $40 at Walmart and those were $15 at Walmart and those baskets were 6 okay so yeah I bought this and it's just like this little rack but I honestly whenever I clean out my closet I know I'm not gonna have all of these shirts because I don't even wear half of them so I figured I only need two racks which is basically like the same thing I have now and then these shelves those baskets are gonna go and there except just two shelves because I'll have like shorts and one and then like something else in another basket you guys guys today is National Clean Your Room Day and I didn't even know about that until someone posted it on Twitter and I'm cleaning my room your girls on top of it today so I just posted a picture on Instagram the Pomeranian picture and guys Pomeranians are so cute I'm so obsessed so I'm thinking that whenever I move out and have like my own apartment or something it's either gonna be a cat or a white Pomeranian how cute would that be or like an orange Pomeranian and name it nugget oh my gosh that's so good it happened okay so I said I had an announcement so this announcement is pretty huge so I bought this camera the T5i a couple months ago and sadly I will not be using this anymore I know how size but I'm selling it on eBay I don't know how much for yet since it's basically brand new I haven't used it very much and there's like no marks on it at all and I have the strap the battery and everything that came with it I will be getting the Canon 70D so I'm basically just trading it but maybe paying like a couple extra dollars for the difference because the 70D is more pricey or more expensive than the T5i so whenever I sell that I'll use that money to get myself the 70D so from my next couple main channel videos I'll be having to film it on my vlog camera which I've done in the past whenever I bought this or whenever I got this camera and it's good quality so it doesn't matter yeah that is my announcement so I'll be filming my main channel videos with my vlog camera which I'm sure you guys won't really care because it's still really good quality but yeah I'm gonna start organizing my makeup drawers and then I'll start cleaning out my closet so I'm gonna put all my makeup in these drawers that you're sitting on right now this song the song is so cute there's my heart okay but no really though I don't know what these are gonna fit like all my brushes are really well I like and I'm done that didn't take long at all so I'll just go through it I guess so on top I got my brushes my bronzer brush my blush brush my blending brush my powder brush and then my beauty blender and then I've got my eye brushes my eyebrow brush blender brushes some scissors tweezers and then this little trimmer thing and then I've got my foundation that is my holy grail it is amazing and then in the first drawer I've got my nix set it don't fret it a two-faced bronzer rock and tour blush it calls my nix translucent powder and then my fit meet and see where and my second drawer I've got my Anastasia brow powder my two-faced primer Urban Decay shadow naked basics and then all my mascara's and I have multiple of the same kinds because I've got waterproofing regular and then I have waterproofing regular of this one but I'm running out of this one but I just have it and this one is just for the wand itself because it separates my eyelashes and then here it's more of like random I guess but it's like the lip products and then some eyeliners and an eyelash color and that is my daily makeup right there and then I plan on getting a a mirror so that I can actually do my makeup at my desk so it's currently storming and honestly wow this guy looks orange you can't even tell but like the style looks so orange right now yeah you really can just see my reflection right now yes pile no pile payers because I have new hangers so up so this is my closet right now all the clothes are out like off the rack but I just realized that I'm gonna have to take that shelf off and I don't know how I'm gonna do that it's gonna be a process me see just chilling but yeah this is great guys I've run into a huge issue that I didn't even think about so whenever I was buying my closet organizer I was just thinking about the rod like I could easily remove that but the shelf is literally melted into the wall so and the thing that I bought I'm pretty sure it's higher than the shelf what am I gonna do I finished building the shelf it's over there but it is like this much why are the under my eyes looks so dark right now okay I look scary the heck that's not normal but yeah it's like this much longer or taller than my shelf and I thought that the shelf like came off the wall but no it doesn't so we have to just like trim it saw down a little bit so yeah my closet right now is on my floor and I'm done and it is it is 12 am on Tuesday night and I'm done so when I built it I said it was too long so we had to cut it so when we'll cut it and it fits now and guys I literally look like a zombie I'm so tired this doesn't normally happen and it looks a lot worse in camera than in person whoa but um here it is so I've got the little rack up here I got room up here for shoes and then these are more like my winter clothes or like longer shirts and then this is like my summer clothes because like since we had to cut this down this part was shorter so like all the shorter shirts had to go down here and then I have shoes that I don't wear that often and then right here I just have jean shorts and then these are all of my swimsuits and I carry scarves and extra hangers and then my daily shoes that I wear and then these are my dresses and rompers and then my letterman back there and then these are all t-shirts literally every single drawer is full of t-shirts except they're sweatpants and hands so yeah pretty organized now all I have to do is add the doors and get rid of the curtains and everything will be finished so yay
