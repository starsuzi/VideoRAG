 Kate's making a classic bread pudding out of brown bread. I'm going to do something with leftover pan chocolate. Cut them into sort of four or five little slices. And then just a quick butter on one side. You're really quick. I'm a chef. Where's the recipe from? Mum? Mum, mum, very much mum. And my grandma as well, actually, they've all done it. Bless. I'm now buttering the bread really badly. And now looks a little like a bit of a... A bit of a sort of overwashed nigger, don't it? It's so nice to see you over here. You're going to see your own glammers with a butcher's apron over that wonderful dress. You look great. Now it's rather sort of asymmetrable. It's a little bit off centre. You've got one in one out. It's really nice. This is what it's like. This is actually a symmetrical top. Not the top, the apron, my darling. Oh, you think it's nice. It's nice and mighty. That's better. Right. Now they're both backing. I've been since you've been up since 2.30 this morning. I have. That's all I get out. Yeah, I know. God. Do you wake up Derek that time of the morning? You just get out. Why not, too? Because he gets really angry. He's a bit like you. I was getting up. Make him up in the morning. You're seriously mad. It's been married to a man with a name of Derek. It's funny, but then when you get to know him, it's sort of stupid. A bed. Do you have to sleep in a separate bed? No, we're still clinging on to sleeping in the same bed. How's the sex life? 2.30 in the morning. There's not a lot. The other day, Derek was saying, there's not a lot at that time. Why am I talking about this? I don't want to talk about that. I was fascinated. You don't want to marry a morning person. Right. If you're getting up at half two, you're not a lot of opportunity. No. You don't want to talk or do anything. No. You don't want to be romantic at that. No. What time's a good time for the sex? I was kind of watcher. I look at my watch. That would be quite good. Right. Listen, let me just... You're distracting me with your talk. That's all I do. That's all I do. It's not... I'm using a really nice apricot jam. I'm going to put my apricot jam at the bottom and on top. Apricot. Yeah, what I'm using? I'm using my mum's orange marmalade. It's really strong. Did my make it, seriously? She did make it. Yes, she did. I'm going to lay on the bottom. Who on the sofa with this morning? Who are you with? Mr Andrew Castle. Andrew Blessing. Do you prefer being with Andrew or Ben? Both. Really? No. Yeah, yeah. And is it true that you and Fiona don't get on anymore? What do you mean? That's such nonsense that we've always got on. I'm going to put a bit of cinnamon in my custard as well. I know. I have cinnamon in mine, actually. People love the idea of a big cat fight between girls. I often used to say that we used to like mud wrestle or something in the morning. Seriously? Well, we should do, shouldn't we? Don't you think? She's amazing, because people would love it. I would watch that. I was going to put you 30 in the morning. You'd be great, wouldn't you? Oh, look, you're just coming around to distract me even more. That's looking great for me. Oh, there's no... Jesus Christ. That's good. No, don't let me stop you. I'm feeling confident, honestly. So you're putting the figs in between. I'm going to put a bit of figs in the dried fruit in between. Nice. And then a bit of sugar. I've made a really nice cinnamon vanilla custard here. At the bottom of my tray. Cinnamon brown sugar. And golden raisins. I don't know what I'm going on top, because I don't want them burnt. And the idea now is putting half of my custard in and soaking it through the panor-shockle. And then from there, spreading some really nice apricot jam on the bottom. That stops it from drying out and keeps the breadin' for to put a nice and moist. I don't know if for this over now. It's got eggs mixed up, about four to... I'm tearing for not measuring, so I think it looks like it should be about four for this size of this dish. Extricity cream. That's it. Oh my god, that's so lumpy. Just Christ almighty. Honestly, it looks like something out of fucking a GMGB soft canteen. Holy crap, even the cab drivers don't eat that shit. That's all about tastings. It's all about the tasting. It's not a beauty competition. Like I've ever gotten you, it's got all... You've got another side to start over. Have you got one bigger than the other? Gravitude for the grand time. Oh my god. I totally don't want to. Oh my god. I don't agree. Egg mayonnaise on toes with your mum's marmalade. I'm so sorry. I'm going to finish my moment. It will touch your dimer eye sugar and talk. And then a little bit of cinnamon. Yes. Just on top. Oh dear, I'm so sorry, mum.
