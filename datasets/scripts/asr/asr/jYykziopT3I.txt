 Hello everybody we're here making a video to show you and explain to you silver metallic acid wash cowhide. Basically one of our top sellers okay we import them from the best Henry in Brazil. The process is done randomly so you dip you drip acid wash on the high which creates these random size circles okay they have no hair and then later you apply a metallic foil via hot press that transfers to the hide where there's no hair you have a solid smooth surface with silver metallic and where there is hair you can see that it gets a glitter everywhere okay so this used to be a white hide and now it looks more grayish because the silver has adhered to the hair on. This particular one is a big size but we offer them in 5x5 and then the regular size about 6x7 or 7x7 feet and then on occasion we have some monster ones that are 9x7 9x8. The flip side of the hide is just a clean gray suede looking type of leather. Thank you very much.
