 Now with the feson, I'm also serving some red cabbage and we all grew up with this stuff, pickled in a jar, but this is done in a very simple form. It started on top of the stove, it's got butter in with it, and then we season it with brown sugar over the cabbage, and then tablespoon of vinegar, add that to the brown sugar, salt, pepper, and then we braise it in the oven for about 45 to 50 minutes, so it cooks nice and slowly, absorbs the vinegar, the sugar caramelises it and it makes it a really nice tasty cabbage. Now I'm serving devil's and horseback with the feson, and that's basically a prune that's been wrapped in bacon, the sweetness, and the saltiness of the bacon goes brilliantly with the feson, coltel stick, keep the bacon on there, into a pan. Get some really good colour on the bacon, it gets nice and crispy, and that crispy bacon with a sweet prune is amazing. Now don't forget to take the coltel sticks out before you serve them, there it is.
