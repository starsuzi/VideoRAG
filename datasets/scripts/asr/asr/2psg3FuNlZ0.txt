 Welcome to Mix This Dream, that I'm Darryl, head barman over at Cocktails to you, a mobile bar hire completely right here in the UK and today we're going to show you how to make the Bahama Mama. The Bahama Mama has hundreds of different recipes and no one really knows who created the original cocktail. So we're going to make this one nice and simple, easy to make, we're going to take our horror cane glass and fill it with ice. You can use the colline glass with these guys that's absolutely fine. We're going to put in one ounce of white rock and I'm using the card here, all the ingredients I use here are high ease, white and white. I mean you'll love the simple market. We're going to hit that up with one ounce of white coconut rock and I'm using Malibu. Now we're building this, we're not shaking it, we want to make it nice, quick and easy to make. Next we have our juices, we have equal amounts of pineapple orange juice, we're just going to top that nearly up to the top of the glass. You'll find it will be about three or four ounces. Next we're going to sweeten our drink with grenadine. Now I'm going to show you how to make grenadine later on in the channel, make it out, it's a lot better, a lot tastier, a lot stachier than you that subscribe for and see that in the future. Next to finish this off we're going to use some dark gold, now I'm using Crack and Supply because it's my favourite and we're just going to use our bastard gently flutter on top of the drink. All I've left to do guys is add that straw and enjoy your drink. A nice easy quick and simple tasty strong drink. I hope you enjoyed it. If you did miss any of the steps or ingredients guys check the description below and I'll be down there and hopefully I will see you next time. Thank you.
