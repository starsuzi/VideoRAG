 Hey this is Brent with Vintage Statements and today we've got a nice six-store dresser and a nice stand that we're gonna redo. So follow along as we make a transformation happen. All right step one is gonna be removing all the hardware, holding the drawers, see what we're working with with our frame, see if anything's loose so we can tighten it up, glue it up, whatever we have to do. Same with the night stand. It's been beaten up pretty bad you can see all the chipmarks, things like that so we're gonna sand all that out, put some paint on it and then we'll get this piece back together and see what we can do with it. So follow along, here we go. All right so we've gone through the piece, we're gonna give it a good sand, wipe it out, vacuum, do all that good stuff. Last night I put some wood putty in here to kind of fill in some of the bigger holes, let it dry so when we do sand it here it was already dry and ready to go. So we're just gonna run through this whole entire piece and night stand and try to make it as best you can. So here we go. Okay we are ready to start painting. Got my Dixie Bell blue here and then our cling-on brush, light blue, we'll put it on, see how it looks, should be pretty fabulous color for this. So we are gonna paint full-length strokes all the way down and back, create our top, work our way down through the night stand and then we'll start on all these drawers. So let's begin. Okay so we've got our nice clear, our paint job done. Now what we're gonna do is put a little clear wax on it flat, do the whole piece and then we can separate some hardware on it and get this under the tree. Alright here it is completed the light blue six-door with night stand dresser, night stand setup. I think it turned out really well. What do you guys think?
