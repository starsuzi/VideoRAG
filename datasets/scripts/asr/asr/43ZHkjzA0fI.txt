 Hey everyone, Trusted Back with another video and in this video I'm taking a look at and reviewing the Lodge Cast Iron 10.5 inch ribbed grill pan and this is it here. Typically I don't like the new Lodge Cast Iron pans because the inside is a little bit too rough but on something that's a ridged pan like this that doesn't really matter but just to compare like this is a vintage grizz-walled right here a grizz-walled pan sort of an antique and you can see how smooth that is whereas the new ones made by Lodge I don't know if you can see the texture they're very textured so I prefer you know the antique ones just because they're a lot smoother and because of the fact that they're a lot smoother they're a lot more non-stick but as I mentioned on something that's ridged like this it doesn't really matter because what's going to happen is all the fats and oils are going to go inside the the little valleys anyway so this doesn't have to be as smooth so anyway I think this is a goodbye at under like $15 that's what I purchased it on Amazon check the description field for pricing and availability and this is great for making things like anything you would anything that you would want to grill inside just on your stove so you can make like chicken with it steaks burgers fish you know anything like that and also you can get the grill marks too which is kind of cool so I have only used this twice and I made burgers with it and it worked really well because most of the fat went down into the little valleys and so I wasn't just cooking in you know just pure fat because most of the fat was you know down below and it turned out really well also my hamburgers have the little grill lines too which is kind of cool and of course you'll also get the grill lines if you're cooking you know fish or you're cooking a steak or chicken or something like that so for the specific uses for a pound like this I really do like it and recommend it especially for the price of under $20 certainly you're not going to cook eggs or something or pancakes you know in a pound like this because their ribs are going to you know really mess you up for that um it comes pre-season I did actually season it myself ones just with a little bit of crisco just to get like more oil on it it then factory stock but I think if you're careful you probably don't need to do that of course like any cast iron you don't want to put it in the dishwasher you only want to hand wash it and after you wash it you want to make sure it's completely dry and you occasionally want to coat it with some oil vegetable oil or crisco something like that uh in terms of cleaning it it will get grease and oil and fat in the little valleys lodge does make a tool a scraper tool specifically for you know the ridge to ribbed pans and as you can see it's got the little cutouts so you know if you have like grease and oil in there this one is clean now but if you have grease and oil in there you can kind of see the tool fits right in the ridges and this really enables you to scrape out the oil really well so you know check the description field I'll put a link to this as well this tool comes with one of these in a regular one a flat one as well for you know a really good price so I highly recommend that in terms of cleaning it cleaning this ribbed one is certainly a little bit harder than you know something that's a flat pan like that but you know it's not that too big a deal it's not too hard I really like this pan so far for grilling just in my kitchen I used to use my regular non-ribbed cast iron pans for things like that but this really works much better in terms of separating the you know meat from the fat and also you know giving you the little grill lines and stuff like that so let me put the little handle cover on here because it's still a little warm and I'll flip this around so you can see the bottom of it it's actually quite heavy actually it's very well made made in America this is the bottom you can kind of see right there the the the lodge logo there we go you can kind of see the lodge logo there and it's also got a handle there on the other side so this has been my look of the lodge cast iron ten and a half inch ribbed pan I think for the price it's really a good buy again I don't generally like the lodge cast iron pans in a smooth pan just because of the texture the texture is not real smooth but in a ridge pan the texture to me matters a lot less so I think this is recommended for discussion and community please see the comments field and for pricing and availability please see the description see you in my next video
