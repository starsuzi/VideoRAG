 Hey guys welcome back to the channel again. I got a little bit of some rump roast here, beef and I got it for 2.88 pound and I'm going to make ground beef and some stew meat too. I would never think I'd be bragging about 2.88 pound for ground beef and I had to grind it myself. Now this piece is going to be the stew meat. I'm only going to have about 2.5 pounds I believe it is when I get through but I'm cutting it with the grain as you can see I'm going down the grain and then I'm going to take and kind of rotate them around and cut them up in little small cubes and like I say I ended up with a 2.1 and a quarter pound package is a stew meat for future stews. Now you'll see how much meat I had here to grind and it looks like a pretty good bit. It looks like more after I grind it because it kind of fluffed up so I'm not going to bore you with the grinding you've seen that before so this is what I ended up with. I ended up with 2 large bowls of nice lean ground beef so I'm going to get out my scales and my vacuum sailor and do some 1 pound packages. Just kind of weigh them up and get pretty good at it if you do a couple of packages. I guess I want to show you a little tip here. Let's get away from the packaging but if you have a grinder, hand grinder or a power grinder if you notice that does not look like ground beef coming out of there well it's not. What I do is I take and put two slices of bread at the very end and you wouldn't believe how this will clean the auger and everything out of your grinder. It really makes it easy for cleanup now. Take it it's just bread and mix it in. You or no one else will ever know the difference. Okay now back to the vacuum sailor I ended up getting 7 and 1 1 1 1lbs of nice lean ground beef. About a 95 5 is what it is. So thanks a lot again guys for watching and I hope you enjoyed and try this sometimes.
