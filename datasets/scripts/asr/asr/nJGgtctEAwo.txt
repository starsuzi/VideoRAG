 Hello, my name is Lailie and I'm Sue Sheffier at Waitress Pukkuri School in Finchley Road. Today I'm going to show you how easy it is to poach a smotadic in milk. I have some whole milk just coming up to the boil. To this I'm going to pop one whole bay leaf and a few whole black peppercorns. This is going to bring extra flavour and permeate through the white fish. I'm going to place my smotadic fillet skin side down. Now I've just been handling raw fish so I'm going to wash my hands. What's important here is to make sure the milk doesn't over boil, so keeping it on a really low heat is key. Just using my spatula I can carefully lift the fish out of the milk and just by squeezing it I can see if it's tender enough to take out. The fish is starting to flake away so it's ready to come out of the milk and I'm going to place it onto my tray here with some kitchen paper. The fish is now ready to serve so that shows you how easy it is to poach white fish and I've decided to serve it with lovely creamy scrambled eggs and grilled tomato.
