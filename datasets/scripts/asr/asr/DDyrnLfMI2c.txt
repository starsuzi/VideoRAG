 Hey guys what's up? I'm here to show you how you and all you need to do a break job on your car. See this is the front brakes on a, oh here's this 2010 Honda Civic, 130,000 kilometers. That's what's left of the brake pad on the passenger side. See it's just about metal to metal you can see there's some heating marks. Now you can show the other side. This side you can tell it was metal to metal and it's been metal to metal for a while. The rotor is actually breaking off. I've never seen this before. See I thinned the rotor's gotten, it's been metal to metal for so long and here's the best part. It's been metal to metal for so long that the backing plate of the brake pad has actually fallen off along with the brake pad. So instead of a brake pad on the front he was using the caliper to stop. This car's from 2010.
