 Welcome back YouTubers. I just wanted to say thank you for my new subscribers. We just put these videos up a few days ago and we've already got four subscribers. I want to really thank you guys and hope you're enjoying the videos here. If you remember a few days ago we put up a video on how to sprout your seeds and how we do it. So today is April 17th. It's seven days later. We're gonna open up this bag and see what we've got inside. See if anything's growing. What's going on in there? A little pen here. Looks like we got a sprouter there. There's another one. Got a root on it. So we got a little bit like we have six seeds here. See one, two, three, four, five. Looks like five of the six seeds have roots already coming out. And the six seed, it's a good seed. It'll start growing here. It's gonna take a little bit more time. You know, you always have a run, right? So here we go. One, two, three, four, five. Five roots already in seven days guys. So if you follow this method you're gonna have great success with your daily seeds and we'll check back in a few more days. See if we can't get 100% germination out of this cross. We'll see what's going on with our run. So thanks for watching guys. We'll talk to you later.
