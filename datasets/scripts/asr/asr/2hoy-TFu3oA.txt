 Welcome back to Gearbest. We have with us today a soil survey instrument. This instrument allows you to check the temperature, the pH level, the humidity and the brightness or the sunlight levels of pots and other places that are very hard to reach. As we use the device on this pot right now you can see that the pH level is very responsive. On the back we have a toggle to allow you to switch to temperature mode. You can switch quickly and easily back and forth. It is also a very durable device. As you can see we are placing this into rocks and roots in difficult to reach places and the reading is still accurate and responsive. Now we are going to test the device on a normal, dirt pot. As you can see the pH level is very responsive and even as we place it into the pot it is a very accurate reading. We can also use this device in liquids. We have here a water bottle and we are going to test the temperature level of this water. At this point we can see we get the readings very quickly from the instrument. Okay now we are going to place our device in a dark or dimly lit place and you can see that we have automatic backlight to allow you to view the screen even when there are shadows and when you can view it. You can see the pH levels are still very clear and responsive.
