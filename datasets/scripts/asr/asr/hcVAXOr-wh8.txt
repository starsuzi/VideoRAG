For this tutorial, you will need a pair of knitting needles and a ball of yarn. Special thanks to our sponsor Lion Brand for providing today's yarn. Today, we are using their Vanished Choice line in the color purple. When you learn to cable, you may find that you don't actually really like using the cable needle because it's kind of cumbersome to slip stitches from one needle to the other and then hold them in the back or in the front. So there is a way that you can cable without using a cable needle. It takes a little bit of practice and you have to be a little bit careful but some people find it easier and a little bit less cumbersome to do. So right now what we are going to do is a cable 4 back. What that means is that we are going to work the cable over these 4 stitches right here. So what we are going to do is move these stitches around on this needle. So we are going to take these 2 stitches off and this is where you need to be careful that they don't come unraveled here. But as long as you are not pulling on the stitches too much, that shouldn't be too big and issue. Next we are going to move these next 2 stitches onto your working needle and then we are going to place those 2 stitches that we just took off back onto our main needle. It's a little difficult to see. Okay so we are just going to make sure that we are right through those stitch holes. Okay finally we are going to slip the other 2 stitches that are on our working needle back onto our main needle. And you can see now that we have prepped these stitches for how they are going to look throughout the rest of the cable as you can see here. So then you are just going to knit your stitches as normal right off of your main needle. Oops, that's a little bit messed up. There we go. Okay so to cable back, I am sorry to cable forward, what we are going to do is a little bit different. We are going to take the 2 stitches off of our main needle. Okay then we are going to remove the next 2 stitches off of our main needle. And we are going to place those first 2 stitches back on our needle. We are going to make sure that the work is behind here. This is going to be moving those stitches up in front. Okay and then I find a little bit easier just to put those loose stitches onto the working needle. And then you can just slip them on from there. Okay and then you just work your stitches as normal. So I don't really find that it's less work to do this but some people don't like having to hold so many needles in their hand and this makes it a little bit easier for them. So that's how you cable without using a cable needle. Want more new stitch today? Check out our website at newstitchday.com. Newstitchday is a crafty media production.
