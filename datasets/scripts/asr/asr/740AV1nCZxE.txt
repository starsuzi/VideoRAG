 So I got a request from an interesting, crazy cat lady to make something you can cook only using a microwave. And just for the record, I'ma downs you don't really look like a cat lady. You actually kind of remind me of one of the girls from that movie The Craft. Hey guys, Super Bowl's coming up and I figured I'd bang out three easy Super Bowl recipes for the next three days. Is this one of them? No. For this recipe, you're going to need some spinach, artichoke, Alfredo sauce, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and a laxative. Start by microwaving our frozen spinach. I really like how it can hold its shape. Microwave our cream cheese, about 20 seconds, just to soften it. Make sure you drain our artichoke hearts, slice them and season, and then just mix all of this into a big bowl. I don't know if the order is important, but I started with cream cheese, Alfredo, spinach, artichoke, spinach, artichoke, spinach. I don't know why I'm doing this stir, and lastly our cheese, and more cheese, and more cheese. That's too much cheese. So I'm going to be using a stone wave. Does it work? Who cares? It's only five bucks, and I believe it can be used for medicinal purposes. Now, pour a mixture in and if you don't have one of these, I'm pretty sure a coffee mug would work fine. And all you got to do is just microwave for a few minutes. Grab your favorite bag of chips, and then essentially scoop some dip out slowly, allowing the cheese to separate generally from itself in a multi-fashion. All right, guys, I got two more recipes coming your way before the big game, and if you do end up making this, it would be really awesome if you guys took a picture of the food and shared it on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram because it's always cool to see people recreate my recipes. Thanks for tuning in. I'll see you tomorrow.
