 Food and life is such a beautiful thing don't you think? Woke up this morning guys feeling like some pasta. What kind of pasta? Shrip up right up pasta. Let me show you how easy it is. How do you guys ask me how long does these meal take me to cook? So right now guys it's 10.54 let me show you. First things first we'll start off with the pasta. So two cups of flour. We're in a quarter teaspoon of salt. Give that a mix. Make a well. I'm gonna crack in three eggs. Take your hand. Mix it in guys. Mix it in slowly. So as you stir try to take as little as flour in as possible. And don't worry guys if this does not form well it's okay to add no water in. Like I said guys if it's not forming that right don't be scared to add a little water in guys. Just a tap bit. Tap bit and work it in. This table has been a little a lot. If this table breaks while in the process of making pasta this pasta will go down in history. Of being the best pasta you will ever put in your mouth. I promise you. Alright once you got this nice and smooth like this time just throw in the fridge to rest. As we let that sit in the fridge for a bit guys let's make our friddle sauce. So we got two tablespoons of butter. I'm gonna press in one tablespoon of garlic. As everything incorporates two tablespoons of flour. And we got to cook this flour and flour has been cooked in. Two cups of vegetable stock. After you got that mixed in two cups of heavy whipping cream. As it slowly thickens up guys I got this cheese right here. The talent style blend. I'm gonna take one cup of this and add it in. So I'm just gonna stir until smooth on a low to medium heat. So here's the part now guys where we test our friddle sauce so I'm just gonna grab a bit. Give this a taste. That's tasty. But I feel like it needs just a tad bit of salt and pepper. Which I'm just gonna add in. Taste it again. Just perfect guys. So taste and adjust the seasoning for your own liking. That's the beauty of cooking. As we are speaking right now guys and rolling out dough the clips is happening right at this moment. I was wondering why this whole room started dimming down to like a tint shade. And now I know because I googled it. All right time to roll our dough. Don't try this at home guys. All we're gonna do is doodle chop this. Got a nice doodle chop guys like I said do not try this at home. I'm a professional. We're gonna take one of our piece. We're gonna roll it out with the pin. If you guys have been watching me for a while guys we have seven dials on this pasta machine and we're gonna pass it through until we get down to the second dial. So seven, six, five, four, three, two. I'm gonna take our dough and splash it with a little flour. And we're gonna feed it through the spaghetti cutter. You know what we're gonna think about that the little thing is that it shipment honey bowl anyway we're going to place it. And then all the same has still been chopped. I'm going to be a little salt and pepper. It's like I got that nice sauce here. We're going to take that beautiful homemade great sauce. I'm going to let you go in. I'm going to turn down the heat. All we want now is just to heat up the sauce. Water's boiling. Take our fresh pasta. Everybody in the pool. I don't care you can swim. Just get in. This will only cook for about one minute guys. Once pasta is complete, I'm just going to drain this. Take your plate. Pour it on. Move it aside. Okay, some more of that cheese. I'm just going to hit this up with a little more pepper. That's it guys. There it is guys. My take on shrimp. A frail pasta. Complete. The time is 12.10 so roughly around one hour to make. Let's get into this. Nice. Look how cheesy and gooey that is. Welcome to Quant's Italian Beast Joule. All right. Take a very good bite for you guys. A shrimp. Oh, you're fixing this. Wow. I can taste it right now guys. Take the first bite of this. Quick time.

Take trips with me guys. Welcome to Flare Town. Mmm. This right here is food. Something about a frail pasta. I do not like it mix just because it just gets very clumpy.
