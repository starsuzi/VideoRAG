 My name is Karlocha and I create this. Welcome to our house, my name is Karlocha and I'm a private house because it was on private houses that the tradition of making the real traditional bolsa, the vinegar of modern us started over 500 years ago and now we live in that house, only me, my mom, my dad and my dog Leon. The very first thing I want to tell you is the secret recipe to produce that amazing product. So to produce traditional bolsa, vinegar of modern us, we need grapes, we need love, we need time, we need passion and obviously we need good barrels. To produce traditional bolsa, vinegar, we start with grapes. So we need Trebiano and Lombusco grapes that we, when we have the harvest that usually is at the end of September, what we do, we pick down grapes from Vina with squisted grapes, we have juice, we have very sweet juice that we cook into open containers, really big and we cook for 12 hours. And after this, there is a huge evaporation of that grape juice and a big concentration of it and we put that cooked grape juice into big wood modern barrels and we leave the young vinegar into the big wood modern barrels for one or two years, helping the product aging. After this to produce the real traditional bolsa, vinegar, we need a battery. A battery is a cereal of barrel, it's the one that you can say, that you can see on your back. So we have oak, ashwood, gin of wood, maltberry wood, cherry wood and each different type of wood gives a different flavor to the bolsa, vinegar during the year of age. Imagine that like 20 years, we started with 100 kilos of grapes that has been pressing, that has been boiling and being into the barrels for 18, 12 years. After this time, we have like one liter of vinegar, it means 10 bottles like this.
