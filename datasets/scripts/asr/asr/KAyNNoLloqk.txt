 To clean leeks, you want to make sure that you clean them very well because leeks do carry a lot of dirt. And since we're not going to use it past the leaves area here, I'm just going to cut this off, set it aside, and I'm going to cut off the base as well. This is the main portion of the leak that you want to use. The leaves can be a little bit tough. Next, to clean them, shred your knife down the center of the leeks, and you're going to rinse them under a lot of cold water. And that will remove any of the dirt in between the leaves. And that is how you clean leeks.
