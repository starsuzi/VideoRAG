 Can you show us how to harvest seeds? Yes, so we're going to be working with rosemary now. And so before they come to the seeds, like the flower is going to, the plant is going to flower. And for the rosemary you can see all these little seed pods. And all those were once flowers and once the flower dries off and dies. They become seed pods. They're really tiny and cute. And so what we're going to do is I'm just going to pull the little pods off. You can sort of see them, just about probably five in there. And so we're just picking all these seeds off. And now with these we can make our little rosemary striters. Or also you can just shake them in the bed like that. And the bed will just naturally be seeded. What's the best way to plant them? Rosemary. Rosemary can sometimes have issue planning from seeds. So I've had better luck with doing cuttings. And from that you can, it's just like a normal cutting you do with any kind of tree or succulent. You just go down to the base where the branch is sprouting off. It'll be a main stock and it'll come off like that. And you'll just want to cut that middle main stock at the base. And then you can use soak the root and water. And you can throw a root stimulator in there like bee vitamins or a mashed up willow branch. Willow is a natural root stimulator. So yeah, and then you can soak in the water for a couple of days to a week and then throw in your garden bed. Or house pile, whatever. Or a slider might.
