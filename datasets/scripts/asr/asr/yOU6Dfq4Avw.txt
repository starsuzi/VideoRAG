 You are the hand that catches my phone. You are the friend that answers my call. You are my day. You are my night. You are my love. And all of my life. Okay, so first you're going to start off with a pillowcase that can be any size and you're going with two. Put the inside out on preferably cutting more that's easy to cut but it's you don't cut it. Oh, see? Put it inside out. The first step is to cut the shoulders out and then make out because so that would be good. So if you come over here, you're going to measure it about right here and you're going to cut about an inch off. So right here, you're just going to go straight across. So you have that and that's the tail part and then you're going to go about four inches into one, two, three, four and cut about one, two, three, four, five, six, seven inches down. And you're going to take this and flip it to this side and you're going to do the same thing. Except that one's easier because it's just like tracing so you just have to do the same thing. It should be a cool cut and then if you have excess, just go to the side. So now your dress should look like this. Okay, so now we're onto the sewing part and you can get biosecate for money where like Joanne's or anything that sells fabric. And you want to get the extra wire double-filled so it's easier to sew so you're going to take your biosecate and you can do any color. It doesn't matter. It should brown so it matches the dress. And so now we're going to take the dress still inside out. You're going to unfold it. You're going to put it right here and then open the biosecate and you're going to put the dress right inside of it along and then close it. And you're going to put it right or the sewing markers. The trick is to go slower so you don't make it any faster. And you just sew along the line and you want it to check up on it so it doesn't go off the line. Yeah. So once you're done you're going to cut off the string. Pull the biosecate through. And then go ahead and cut the excess off right here. And if there's any extra thread, you want to cut that off so it doesn't get too much. And now you're going to do the same thing to the other side. A little bit. This way. And take your biosecate. Fold it over. And just keep. You want to add a few extra threads. And do the same thing to the other side so you want to cut off the thread and then cut off the excess. So now your dress has biosecate on both sides. And now once you have your biosecate on both sides you're going to fold about one inch and you're going to fold it twice. Outwards from the dress. So it should look like that. And you're going to keep it in place. And you're going to carefully sew it in a row. This is the top of your pillowcase dress. Okay, and then the same thing as you did before, curl in the excess. And then the other side. And fold. One. One. One. And then the other side. And then the other side. Okay. So now you can go ahead and cut off excess one more time. And now you're ready to add ribbons for the top of your dress. So you're going to turn it inside out. And for this you can either use ribbon or you can use shoelaces. It doesn't matter. But we're going to go ahead and use a ribbon. Okay, so we have our dress that looks like this on full size. And it's flipped inside out now. And you are going to take your ribbon, a safety pin, and scissors and you're going to take a safety pin. The ribbon, you're going to go right through it like that. So it looks like that. And then you're going to carefully bunch it through. The neck of the dress. And now everyone want to do this because I see that you're going to bunch that then fold through. And then you take it and you go through the other side. And however you want your arm will feel like if you cut it before or whatever. This is the time to do that. So now you're going to cut the ribbon and the safety pin off with that. And you're going to cut it. Either a bow or a knot. This one looks like a drill job. And there you go. You have a Pilkei dress ready to go.
