 Hi, it's Kirk with A&A Plumbing. I'm here to talk to you today about Carver's Disposers. Sometimes you may hear noise like this. You can take just a simple Allen wrench and underneath you can, there's a place you can insert this and actually free up your carver's Disposers. I'm going to show you that right now. Just go ahead and spin it around a couple times until it feels like it's pretty easy to turn. Then what we'll do is we'll go ahead and share some water first here. Okay, and that about does it. If you have any questions about plumbing or anything else, give it A&A Plumbing and call.
