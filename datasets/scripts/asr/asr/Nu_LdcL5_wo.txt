 Good morning everybody this is fair with this is how you do it and I'm on my way back to the house I just did my walk I set the trap hard up on the porch so I can put y'all on that once I get back I had a good walk and I was thinking about a lot of things that I can talk to the young people about you know you know sometimes you talk to people about stuff if you talk into your children they don't listen but if somebody else said it to your children then they are here and they may hear it better from somebody else so what I'm going to do is I'm going to store given out some of the wisdom and the knowledge that I've learned in this 53 years of my walk on the planet and I'm think I'm going to store sharing a little maybe one thing once I finish my walk with y'all and maybe by me doing that I'll read what I sow and then that knowledge could be passed on to my children if not by me then by somebody else cost a bible I'll always say you read what you're so right and so I'm going to store someone knowledge to young people I'm hooking up the trap hard now y'all so y'all bear with me try and get that thing on the nail you girl just had a wonderful walk wonderful walk enjoyed it tremendously and now I'm going to set the trap hard up I'm still a little winded y'all from walking I don't even know if I really need to set the trap hard to tell you the truth but I will just let the camera be healed by something besides my hand okay now what I was thinking about while I was on my walk now I thought about you know how we tied we tied 10% until a little well y'all need to look up tithing yourself because sometimes wisdom and knowledge come by reading and studying on your own but my thing is I told all of my children to tithe to themselves and then you say they are what you mean by tithing to they sell take 10% out of your income and put it in a bank once it grows enough to where you can buy a CD or something like that buy a CD and let that money grow that way you can build a savings account you can build a nest egg you can go out and buy the house you won't even if you don't use that money you can use that collateral because that money will be like on on a freeze now another thing about that tithing okay now that's tithing now those that can't tie that they're already tithing and they're already um strap to the max on what they're doing in life I say this take 15 dollars which you were probably spend going to McDonald's or you will stop it anytime after your pay period you're gonna spend 15 dollars and if you get if you get paid every two weeks take 15 dollars put it in the bank put it in like a Christmas fun or something like that that you can't touch and they will find you if you touch it that's like once a year now if you put 15 dollars in the in the bank every two weeks you would have $480 at the end of the year now if your house know when I first got a house my house knows running right 300 some dollars are $400 at the end of that year take that $400 now house notes a little bit more now but you already have the battle you can take that $400 add some to it and pay one house note extra that's in that year and what you'll do if you have a 30 year mortgage you'll pay off your house in 15 years now let's see I said at the end of the year take that at that $480 and put it to what the principal your house don't just take your your pay me to say well you're gonna write a check and just pay your house note because only probably $100 some dollars at the rate to their end it's gonna go toward the principal and all the rest of it is gonna go toward the interest now by paying off your principal that's what bringing your house note down so when you pay a extra house note put it on the check toward the principal and that way that will start knocking your house note down and you'll pay for your house note in half of the time or what you are when what you apply for put it toward the principal that is very important right on the check pay to the principal because if you don't they'll put it on the interest and you may have $20 toward the principal $30 toward the principal $100 toward the principal maybe no more than that and all the rest though to be paying off the interest paying off the bank and this is very I would this is how you do it pardon a little wisdom but you picked up along the way and I thank you and I see you on the next video bye bye now
