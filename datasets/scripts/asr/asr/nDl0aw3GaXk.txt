 The back pad consists of a saddle, girth, tugs, both sides. You're bridging, and you're crooper. This is what you put on first. Here's the withers of the pony, the back pad, or saddle goes right behind the withers. Nobody likes a tight belt, snug, but not tight. You don't want a tight belt. Nobody likes that. Okay, the bridge is set for this pony correctly. That's where it goes. You buckle the crooper. Put it underneath. You too, bro. You should be snug too, but not tight. Can we pull the tail across and just see exactly how you want us to have it? You want to make sure there's no hair under the tail. I'm pulling it out. Okay, think where you are. I'm sorry, I pulled you back too far. Talk to the director. If you don't want any hair under this cloak, go out. Yeah, that's you. This is your breast collar. Have sewn in traces. This is what attaches to the cart. She pushes the cart. She doesn't pull it. She goes behind the cart. Pushes it? No, because they actually add information. They're pushing against the breast collar. They're pushing the cart and not pulling it. Because they had a pull it. The true sense of the word, they would not be able to do this job. Not pulling much as they do. Right. Okay. You want the breast collar above the shoulder. You want it above it. But that's so high that's going to cut a window off. This is a bad idea. You can't see where the breast collar sits exactly. You got to go by the leather. It's like dropping the jacket a hole. Everything's down here. And it is on the last hole. Up here on top. Here's the last one. Yeah, but if I really do that, you don't want it just one side. It's just simple. Traces. We'll go over the back like that. Do you want to do that in a little bit? There we go. With range attached and a side check. Just put the range on her back. So you don't step down. And I remember you told me put the bride long before you hook up the cart. Yes. Yeah, it's number one. Rule number one. Rule number one. Our exception to that rule, but just stick to it. There's no exception. And this world. I don't know exactly. What will tell Kenny? She's trying to bridle her for her. Yes, absolutely. I see. It'll be done. I'm putting the check on her now. So we don't have to worry about her. I'm putting the check on her. So we have to worry about her. Do your head down. Try to eat stuff. Be honest with you. That's what that's for. That's one reason. Now, I know when I'm riding, if they get their head down, they can buck me off. But if they get their head down with the carriage, they can get away from you. They can check buckles and shabs. That's what they can check. They can check those a lot of things. If they get their head down, they can check and buck him up. They can check for them. They can minimize it. They can minimize it. They just throw it last. You want to make sure you can get your fist in there. So. What do you got like three fingers? They make a fist like that. Oh, okay. I see. Well, they flex their neck. They can breathe. Are you going to choke them to death? There's too much chances. No, but. I think how you would feel if you had a tight tie on or a necklace. The noseband, can you say that again? Please tighten it. The noseband. Or cap, since there's another name for it. And you want to snug not tight. Okay. Come here, baby girl. Then you take your rings and you run to your carrots. Look at these big rings on top of the saddle. Terits in a castle. Terits. To you, R-R-E-T-T-S. I can't still. Okay. Terits. Think Terits in a castle. Terits. Okay. Okay. Okay. Peter, put these rings up over her back. Then you have steppin' on them. Okay. Now we're going to go over top of the stack that goes to the open check. You called again? Check straps under your dress cap. Oh, under that open. Yeah, I made a move. Okay. I'll straight to under. Yeah. Yeah, under. Yeah, that was all right. Check straps go under the dress cap. It's all right. It's all right. It prevents it from flappin' around and there. I get doin' that forget. Anyway, this is the cart. I don't know what's there. I always touch them lightly. Even my horse, this has been riding 20 years. I get the same thing. I know what's going on right. Right. You put the Shaves. Hey, she's little. If you do this. Right. Okay. There we go. Riching. What? The bridging. This is right here. Is your whole back strap? We're gonna get it on this side. Yeah. I will talk to you again. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I will talk to you again. But you are happy for your coaching. That's your break folks. You're all coaching, you're all breaks. I'm happy for you. You put a little bit through the whole back straps. Show me the time you have the side. I have a snap here on your whole back strap. You go over here and snap it to your coaching. No, coaching, no breaks. Again, you don't want this too tight and cart run down. You want me to hold the cart? No, no, no. But if it's this is cart is already adjusted to her. But if it's really tight, you're always getting this kind of signal. What on the butt? Yeah. Okay. That's your breaks. Can you take your tracers? Okay. Can we get through it? I'm putting it through part of the whole back strap. Oh, we got to watch this one. Okay. It is the same on the other side. Okay. What are you doing now? Putting through the whole back. The strappers, call it the whole back. Just the last. Okay. Yeah. Did that have sewn in tracers? You put it on the cart just to leave them there. Then you put it through this. Bring that loop there. And all this keeps the cart from slithering. I got them in the second hole. Second one. This is your... I don't know what it is. It's a technical. This is called Tilbury Tug. Now, there's one on the other side. Right? Yeah, that's the two straps. Okay. Tilbury Tug. Set up. It means the sheds are free-closing in the tub. So you get the cart and make water that a little bit and slide back and forth. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Tugs are last. Tugs, oh yeah. The two left, yeah. I could have... I can't. I'm gonna add two. He really should get shafts stopped for a cart, when Tilbury comes up. I'm sorry. What? Shaf stops. Shaf stops. Yeah, the piece of metal. Uh? The piece of metal that goes right back here. I want to hand sticks out like that. And it told the closing front of the thing that sticks out. It keeps the cart from sliding forward. Is this set up? Oh, this pole here going back and forth. Yeah, this pole she has. And she has stopped. What's stopped? The whole thing will stick here. It will help keep the cart from sliding. What are you going to tell us? I guess any other place? Any harms, please. Oh, any harms, please. Yeah, you have to go and deal with it. Many find them on at the end of the event. You'll keep your pole. OK, she is now officially home. That's right. That's right in the way. Go on. Go on. Go on. Wait a minute. That's a range. Over there. You can't get the girl. The girl. Go down. Go down. Down, down. Down. Down. Down. You're going to be a fast guy. That's a little bit of a fast guy. Yeah. So now we're going to unhook her. Take the trace off. She's a girl. I'm doing your pole back strap on snap it. Pull your trace through. Trace is first. I don't know. Unsnap and buckle. You tug strap. Remember the arcing side? Yes, you should get that somewhere else. Snap the trace. I can see for getting that. Yeah, the first is up and flitching. Pull it through. Pull it over her back. Unbuckle. You tug strap. Pick up the cart. Pull it off. Pull it off. Okay. Do not remove the bottle. Why she still hooked to the cart? Hammer. Got that. Unshacker. Now it's a good thing she was checked when she had her little moment. Yes. Because then she would have been able to go sideways up and down. Are you going to do the press play, John Buckwick? Just for information. If she's the only one who uses this, she can even buckle up and slip it over her head. She can't sit in the room with this. Bring it out. Put those on the carrots. And my assistant will take the room. I will take the press play if you like. You have two assistants. And you see this over. And then down. Very good. Very good. So you put your harness on the whole harness. And but not the traces. Open the triceps. And then you checker. And then you just ground driver. This is like basic 101 step. Okay. We'll pretend it's all right. You'll put your reins through the tarrots. Or you put them through the tugs. And then you just put them down the tugs. That way the lines go around her hip. So if you start swigging around, you need that line to stop them. And you keep them going straight. She's low enough. You can walk to the side of her. If you're worried about her kicking at you. But she probably, I don't know her that well. She's a well behaved pony. Her own. Her own kick rate is probably about 60. That's four, it's 70 to get her. All right, great. I'm going to go back and start drawing. It's a different experience. I'll see you back here now. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord. Good lord.
