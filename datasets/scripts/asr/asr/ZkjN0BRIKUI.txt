 Alright alright, welcome to bartender extraordinaire. Today we're going to be making a chocolate martini. Chocolate martini simply consists of vodka, the dive of chocolate l'Cour and I personally like to put a little splash of bay leaves in mine. I think it sweetens it up a little bit more. It's delicious. So what you're going to do, start off with the shake and full of ice here. Give yourself about two ounces of vodka. One thousand one, one thousand two. Followed by about two ounces of cadaver chocolate l'Cour. One thousand one, one thousand two. Then, like I said, I like to give it just a little splash of bay leaves here, just to sweeten it up. So just go on and splash a little bay leaves up in there as well. What you're going to do is get your shaker, top on and shake that bad boy right on up. Get it nice and cold. Mix all those ingredients up. Shake it around the counter. Two handed shake. Oh yeah, nice and cold, nice and cold and frothy. Now what I like to do is give a little bit of chocolate sauce and garnish your glass with it. So just swizzle some chocolate sauce on there right out of the jujube hole. There we go. Chocolate sauce. Simply strain your chocolate martini right on top of that. Oh yeah. Look at that. And that is how you make a delicious chocolate martini. So drink and enjoy. Wow, that's good. Please drink responsibly.
