 Hello, I'm Philip and this is Hoops and we are from the main ingredient. We're a vent catering space just outside London and today we're going to show you how to make a great little recipe. And tabula essentially is a herb salad with bulgur wheat running through it. Lots of people put too much bulgur wheat in relation to the herbs. So what we've got for you here is flat leaf parsley which is going to finely chopped, fresh mint which is again going to finely chopped, one clove of garlic, a little salt and pepper and then bulgur wheat. We've got about 50 grams here and this has been cooked in salted water. The instructions on the packet when you buy them from supermarkets tell you not to cook it. They tell you just to rehydrate it as they would for couscous. But in our experience we find it's better to cook it in boiling water than when it's soft to eat, then strain it out and then refresh it quickly with cold water to cease the cooking any further. We're going to add three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Make sure it's a really good one and with that the juice of a couple of lemons and then this part we have some ground cinnamon and ground all spice and some finely chopped spring onion and finely chopped tomatoes. We've deceded them, there's three here and really really good tomatoes, you want tomatoes that are full of flavour, don't you flip it. So to put it together you literally just mix all the ingredients. So that's the bulgur wheat going on which has been cooked, quickly rinsed down to cold water and then spread out to dry, then finely chopped, flat leaf parsley, finely chopped mint, make sure you take the leaves, for decoration on the top. So make sure you take the leaves off the stalks there and the finely chopped tomatoes are really good to flavour some tomatoes and spring onion, finely chopped, the all spice and the ground cinnamon, really simple dish to make, I give it a little bit of flavour then. And then this is extra virgin olive oil mixed with some lemon juice, already in there, a little bit of salt and pepper and then just we've got a small garlic clove which we're going to put in, you're going to overgarlic heat but you do want some for some flavour, just a tiny bit, a little bit. And then just mix that together. To leave that as well as you can't use the flavours to develop. And traditionally it's served by the Lebanese as part of messe, so there's lots of other dishes you can add to it and you can serve it with flat bread which is really nice or you can serve it with another dish and that's how you make tabula. you
