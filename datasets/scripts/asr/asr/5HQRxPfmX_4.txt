 My name is Alan Gansky and I'm about to show you a science experiment. My experiment is can you blow up a balloon using vinegar and baking soda. My hypothesis is that you can't because if you can't blow up a balloon with water and baking soda, why would it work with baking soda and vinegar? The materials are vinegar, baking soda, an empty bottle, a funnel, and the balloon. So first you pour one third of vinegar into the bottle. Then you grab the balloon and put it over this part of the funnel. Then you grab the baking soda and pour not so much in but just enough to fill about half of the balloon. Then you take it off and you put it on top of the water bottle without breaking the balloon. So then you turn up the balloon and it'll blow up the balloon. Hold it tight so it does not explode. What caused the chemical reaction which made the balloon blow up is that vinegar is made of purified alcohol and baking soda is made of sodium hydrogen carbon and oxygen. When those mix up they create carbon dioxide which goes up and blows up the balloon. That was my science experiment. Thank you for watching.
