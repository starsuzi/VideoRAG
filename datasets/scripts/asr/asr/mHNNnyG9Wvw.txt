 Well, hi, welcome to the Internet Shell YouTube video channel. We're processing pecans that are grown in Nebraska here in Waterloo, the Sorenson orchards, Bill Sorenson and Sonny's orchards, and they have the whole on them still, and we want to show you how they run with the whole on them through the Patriot 600. So here we go. I want to show a comparison. Okay, so here's a comparison between the whole on them compared to the pecans that are grown right here on the Sorenson farm, and these are cultivars. These are a cultivar that Bill grafted years ago, beautiful trees. All right, so here we go Patriot 600. We need this bucket here, don't we? All right, Patriot 600. Bill has modified his machine, and he's got a place to hang a bucket. So here we go. Yeah, right, right. Okay, let's look at the results and see how they look. Put them on here. Well, we can just be able to take a look at them here first. I'm gonna dump them out here, I guess, on the sorting table. And that's what the whole on them. Bill said that he likes the percentage of halves he's getting when he leaves the whole right on him and cracks them. Now here he goes with his... Well, I'm pretty impressed. There's the smaller, there's the smaller pieces and meats. And there's the smaller pieces there, cleaned up. And then there's all the little pieces ready for the chickens to eat. Well, thank you, Bill. That was great. All right, next we're gonna we're gonna process some pecans the way they do it down south. They soak them in water or steam them first and that's what we're getting ready to do next. Okay, join us.
