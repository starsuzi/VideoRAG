 Today I'm going to put new felt down on my pool table. I wanted to change it to the faster, worsted wool that they use today. Okay, I'm showing you the bolts underneath the table. These bolts were, you have to remove to take your rails off. I'm also going to point out on this video. There's no staples holding this felt. Now it's all glued down. I use a spray adhesive. I've done this several times. I've never been trained or never been taught how to do this, but just about every table I've done the people suggest you ought to do this professionally. This is perfect. So what I'm saying is totally my experience. So there probably is better ways. When Aaron just ripping up the old felt, you could see on the marble where the glue is sprayed, glue is sprayed underneath the parts of the marble that are underneath the rails. Just like I'm pulling it off, you spray and you're pulling your stretch. You spray, you're pulling your stretch. When you put that spray down, fold it, flatten it out, curve it around and put some spray adhesive on the bottom. Your felt stays put pretty good. It's not great. Sometimes it is a pain. Sometimes I'd say it's a lot easier with two people, but I just wanted to show this video because there isn't many on there and maybe this might help somebody. Here's where I ran in the problems. Re-leveling everything, re-leveling, waxing. I put wax in between the crack on my marbles. Then I flattened it out, razor blade and putty nice. This is me testing everything, trying to figure out what I need to do. I spent a lot of time with that re-leveling, re-waxing and I ran out of a camera man and I ran out of patience. I didn't get this video complete, but hopefully there was something I put here that's going to be helpful to somebody if they're going to attempt to do this on their own. I could get an eye-polarized and then get it done. Thank you.
