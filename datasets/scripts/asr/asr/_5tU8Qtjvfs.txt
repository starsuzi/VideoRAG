 Hey guys, what's up Charlie Pengu sir. So today I want to show you guys how to make your own neck labeled design for your shirts Just to add some more customization to them. They're also known as Tag print designs or whatever you want to call them really but basically the purpose of them is to add a really cool design Where the size of the shirt would go. So let me actually demonstrate real quick before we actually get into the design aspect of this video So let me grab a belly canvas blank and yes, I'm using belly canvas blanks. Of course. I don't even need to explain why they're great They also have tear away tags, which is important for this video So basically belly canvas is a high quality wholesale brand So if you guys are looking to buy wholesale blanks from any company definitely check out belly canvas The one thing I absolutely love about belly canvas blanks is the fact that you could rip away this tag They're tear away tags. So if you do want to actually print your own label right here You can just tear this tag away and I can literally do this all day long. It's fun I'm never gonna get bored of that sound since belly canvas has tear away tags now We can customize the garment even further by coming up with our own tag print design or neck label design And that's what makes designing close so cool is the fact that you can literally customize every aspect of the garment And that's what we're doing today. We're gonna come up with this design I'm gonna show you guys everything you need to know about the neck label designs and all the specs and stuff like that So you guys have a good understanding of how it works at the end of this video. Let's hop in the illustrator and get started So when you guys are actually creating your neck label design There's a couple things that you need to really keep in mind when designing and a lot of it has to do with the sizing and The information that you're putting on the actual neck label But the number one thing is obviously size so if you design something foreign to buy foreign So you're gonna be safe Another thing that's really important is font size You want to have a minimum font size of six points in illustrator if you go any smaller than that It might be really hard to read and it might not print the best either so try to stay within six points When you're creating your design and that goes for a lot of different things You don't want to go too small in the font size because it really can affect the final print Especially with neck prints a lot of times they're printed with a lighter ink So you really really want to maintain as much detail as possible in the fonts and to do that Just stay within six points or above and you'll be fine The next one's obvious you want to include the garment size because if you don't include the garment size How are your customers going to know exactly what size shirt they purchased if you don't include that it might confuse some people So include the garment size whether it's extra small through extra large Whatever it may be just include it so they know so there's really nothing else to say about that That's kind of common sense the next thing is fabric composition and so what does this mean Charlie? So fabric composition is basically what the shirt is made out of so if it's a hundred percent cotton You need to put a hundred percent cotton if it's a hundred percent cotton with a little bit of polyester at five percent polyester Whatever it is you need to include that so find out what your garments made out of and include that For Bella cam specifically a lot of the ones that I just showed you are a hundred percent heirloom combed and rings fun cotton So we got to include that on the neck label. I'll show you that in a second So moving on to the last two points where is the garment actually manufactured? What is the country so that one's very very simple? Just make sure you include the country on the neck labels well so people know where it's made So last but not least you want to include wash or care instructions This is how people are gonna know how to wash your garment properly that one's important because if people don't wash the garment right It might shrink on them and they might be mad at your company or your brand or whatever for not telling them if they choose to read The instructions it's basically up to them But it's important to include it so people know how to wash the shirt that they bought from you appropriately So it lasts the longest and it fits the best so that was all very important information for creating your own neck label designs Now we're gonna move on to the design aspect of this video because that's just as important The goal is to make your brand stand out and creating a custom design is the way to do it I have one right here that I just kind of put together just to show you guys We have the brand name like we already discussed the the shirt size We have the actual material that the shirts made out of we have made in the United States Which is the origin the country whatever and then we have wash instructions pretty simple stuff But we can take this and really run wild with it. We could do whatever we want with it So this is a basic one, but the main thing to keep in mind is the size here, right? We have it in a 4 inch by 4 inch size now We're gonna move on to the the other our board here. So this is again 4 inch by 4 inch We're gonna use this as a Guideline to design our new label We're gonna cut this and put it on its own layer and we're gonna make this a template So that's on its own layer now So what I want to do is select it and make it a really light color because I just kind of want it to be there but not too Disruptive right to what we're designing. So now we're gonna create one more layer And that's where all of our art's gonna stay right? We're actually ready to design now So what we want to do is we actually want to type out something So I'm gonna type out brand and this isn't so much like a step-by-step tutorial as much as it is Just showing you guys how they are made right because that's more important than just showing you guys step-by-step So basically we're gonna create a Name real quick. It's just gonna be called brand and we're gonna type out a font and we're gonna leave it like that So that's pretty cool. Why not so that can stay there? We can actually move this to the left a little bit Again, we're staying within those boxes right we can even set rollers down if we really wanted to get creative We're just gonna create a circle and we're gonna lay it right there right next to it So within that black circle is where the shirt size is gonna be and this is all my decisions It's up to you what you want to do So I made that am a little bit bigger to fit within the black circle It's important to note the font size So I have over six point font as long as you're making your font over six points You're perfectly fine if it's any smaller than that it might be hard to read keep that in mind now We want to bring over some other important information which is the actual Material that the shirt is made out of so we're gonna bring that over so we don't have to retie But we're just gonna bring it over we're actually gonna copy that and then paste it on layer three So we have it we're gonna put that right below everything So as you can see everything's just kind of like in a nice little rectangle right now So now we have the material that the garments made out of now we can include United States of America as a origin So we can actually duplicate this and type out United States of America United States of America or USA You could do whatever you want really it doesn't matter. All right We're doing good guys. We have the material that the shirts made out of and we have the origin now I want to put the wash instructions now what I want to do is actually move this Information to the bottom and make it smaller because we don't have to do anything we don't want to do right We can position everything how we want it we can place it wherever we want it as long as the information is there That's what's important. We're just gonna draw a rectangle right here and everything's gonna be in a box pretty much So now we're gonna do wash instructions type that out wash instructions just like that and Let's go ahead and resize that and make sure it's at least six points. It's eight points So we're good now we can make that white instead of black and we can basically drag that into place So we're gonna type out wash cold and Hang dry or what I put hand dry We're gonna put hang dry right here and that's basically where the wash instructions are gonna sit And we're gonna resize it to fit all the way across So we have the wash instructions and I didn't like how the bottom text was right here where the the shirt material was and the origin So what we're gonna do is we're just gonna put the material first and then we're gonna do a dash and we're gonna put USA or made in USA just like that keep it really simple So I just added all the important information now I kind of want to do some extra stuff to make the design look better Obviously we're we have a little bit of inconsistency with the text at the bottom So we're gonna change it to the rest to go font right here And I also extended the box to fit all the text and now I'm just gonna do a little bit more resizing Now another thing that I noticed is the box and the circle are not rough like the font So we're gonna fix that real quick I'm actually gonna add a stroke real quick and this is more preference. You don't have to do this I'm gonna add a stroke and I'm gonna make the stroke black and I'm gonna change Basic to this rougher edge and as you guys can see it looks like it actually belongs with the design a little bit more We're gonna do the same thing to this black box right here And you guys are gonna see a big difference in a second hair So we're gonna make that a little bit bigger So that's basically it from here We can duplicate the necklabel design and we can make it different sizes like we can do a large for this one And we can keep doing it for all the sizes that we want So the print shop has all the sizes this video is really just to get you guys started and get you thinking about necklabel designs Because it really is a fantastic way to customize your brand and really take it to the next level Another important thing is obviously the garment right you need to choose the right garment I just showed you guys some Bella canvas garments where you can just rip away the tag and it's ready to go with your necklabel print But again, it's really up to you what you do I definitely recommend you guys check out Bella canvas I will have all their links in the description below.
