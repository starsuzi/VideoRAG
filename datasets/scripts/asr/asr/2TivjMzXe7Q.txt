 I guys, in today's video I'm going to show you how to make sugar water. And we only use sugar water, only for mini-nix and nix would have really, really small. And here we go. We're going to make it. Now, get your funnel and a two, two liter bottle or some sort. And get some sugar, white sugar and corn. I see how much it goes up there. And then, here we go. That's how much you need. Oh sugar. And here we go. And put the room watering. That's enough water at the moment. Now you shake it. And that's what it looks like. And we have to get it with we call one of those two ones. There we go. Oh, now in the syrup, you'll see if it's clear, damage your finish. And if it's still a little bit hot, you have to let it cool down. Because the bees can't have it when the sugar water's hot. So, yeah. Like and subscribe and see you next video.
