 We're going to start off by peeling one whole onion and then cutting it into four sections and then just slicing them down like I'm doing right now. So the spiciness can all depend on what you want to do with this and we are going to be putting in five in minds because we like a lot of space especially in our pindies or okras whatever you want to call it. So we've put in a whole bunch and this is something we're going to put off to the side because this is going to be like the last thing you want to place into your dish. I've just cut down the okras into one centimetres and then we're also going to need salt for this. Also we're going to need some vegetable oil. Place a couple of oil in a heated pan and you want to throw in the onions and then just fry them until they're slightly golden. As you can see they're just very lightly golden but they're also very translucent so that's exactly what you want to keep it like. Then you want to put in the okra and just keep stirring or just frying. You don't want to stir too much because you don't want to break the pindies up because they're very very delicate and by stirring too much you can break them so just use a spatula that's flat like I'm using and try to pick up from the bottom and flip the pindie over. Keep flipping and keep stirring until you are satisfied with the way the pindie looks. Time to 15 minutes after the pindie has been cooked as you guys can see it's getting very very slimy and then throw in the peppers and also a little bit of salt. We like our okra to be very crispy so we allow it to cook for a while. I've seen many people that don't like it cooked that much and they like it to be a little green however we like it to be crispy we usually fry it more than this before the sake of the video we kept it to this. Anyways we really hope that you guys enjoyed this video and have fun. Bye!
