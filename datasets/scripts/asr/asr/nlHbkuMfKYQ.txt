 Broccoli is grown a couple of different ways. We both direct seed which means we put the seed in the ground and it grows up to a plant and also sometimes in greenhouses and then transplant it into the field. Usually it's 75 to 118 days between seed to harvest. This little branch, the little trees, called the laterals and sometimes they'll start way down here and they'll be really long and sometimes they'll start up higher and they'll be short. The shorter laterals are better for our crown cut and the longer laterals are easier to bunch. So generally you're going to cut down wherever you want to stop and whether it be short for a crown or longer for something you're going to bunch and then you're going to trim the leaves off. Then we have a crew that will either bunch it or pack it into a box and then the box goes to our cooler and it's cooled and sent to market. In Florida with our broccoli crops we can have that product on the shelf basically in a day. So I can cut it this morning and it can be in the store tomorrow. Pretty much all parts of the broccoli are edible but the broccoli head itself is what you typically find in the store. It's made up of little buds and so what you want to look for in the store is a nice tight head where the buds are small and uniformly green. Broccoli is the original superfood. Broccoli actually contains twice the vitamin C in an orange. So if you love Florida oranges you're going to really love Florida broccoli. Broccoli also has almost as much calcium as whole milk. My family has been an agriculture for six generations. So my sister and my cousin and I are really proud to be part of this growing operation here in Florida allows us to just continue with the legacy that we hope will keep going on. I'm Tara Smith-Mageddi and I grow broccoli fresh from Florida.
