 So this one is for Barb. She asked me how do you get a flat cupcake so that you can decorate or lay down a piece of rice paper design that she already had printed up. Here's how you do that. Okay I have a pastry bag fitted with just a coupler so it's just a round tip. Okay if you have a large round tip you can use that instead and my buttercreams inside. I'm going to take that and hold it straight up and down and pipe a ball of buttercream on top of my cupcake. Once I've done that I'm going to use a mini offset spatula and all I'm going to do here is I'm going to pat the buttercream. My goal is to keep this rounded edge that I've piped so as I pat it I'm kind of pushing that out to the edge and I pat all the way around so that it goes to the edge of the cupcake to the edge of the paper that seals in my cake so that it'll stay moist. Once I've done that I just take my offset spatula and wipe across the top. So let me show you one more time. I take my pastry bag straight up and down and pipe a ball of buttercream on top. I take my mini offset spatula and I'm just patting the top. Don't touch the edge. Pat the top so that it pushes that edge out. Go back, wipe off any excess and there you have it a flat top cupcake ready to receive whatever decoration you want. Thanks!
