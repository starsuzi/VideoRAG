 Hey everybody it's Kimberly. Today I wanted to, well in my previous video I was showing you how to make Mexican rice so that's just a side dish to my chicken enchiladas that I'm making. To me it's, I forgot about Mexican restaurant and I have really good authentic enchiladas on my plates and I get crap rice and beans on the side like boxed rice and canned beans on the side. It just ruins my whole experience for me so I'm making the homemade Mexican rice to go along with my chicken enchiladas so I'm just gonna kind of like I'm pretty new to filming videos for YouTube but cooking is like my passion I love to do it. It makes me happy and I know there are so many people out there that want to learn how to cook or love to cook or whatever the reason so I figured I would just share my recipes with you which was hard for me to do because everybody's always like oh you're such a good cook how to make it and I'm like you I'm not telling you the secret so I'm gonna just share it with YouTube world so that's a big step for me. So yeah like I said I'm gonna make chicken enchiladas I have made a homemade red sauce it's really super easy to make I can do a video on how to make the homemade red sauce if you want so for now I'm just gonna show you what I have done. Pardon my hand. I got my doggy's George and Pebbles in the kitchen cooking with me they're gonna help me out here so what I've done is for the chicken I've just taken some boneless skinless chicken breasts and just kind of slow cook them in the slow cooker for like overnight basically so they're pretty tender they're gonna just kind of shred right up so what I'm going to do is just go ahead and shred all of that and once I'm finished I will be back and I will show you the red sauce and how to make it enchilada how to roll them and so for so let me shred this up and I'll be right back. Hey guys I forgot to mention I had slow cook this chicken that I just shredded what I did was I just put it in my slow cooker overnight for about I don't know 10 hours I threw it in there frozen with some water and I need salt and you know powder girl salt garlic powder a little bit of Camino and a double if you don't know what a double looks like mine my messy cupboard it looks like this this is like one of my staples that I have in my kitchen at all times you can get several different variations of it you can get it without pepper with pepper this has cumin in it you can get it without it so I just kind of threw my chicken in the slow cooker with whatever I felt like throwing in with that which was like I said garlic powder girl salt onion powder and salt a ton of a double I couldn't even tell you how much I use because honestly it's probably at least like a fourth of cup for every seasoning that I use I can do like a more S or a more accurate recipe if you guys want to know that but basically if you just throw it in your slow cooker with water salt or chicken broth what's in salt is in seasonings and bay leaves whatever you like you're chicken to taste like would work fine so this is what it looks like shredded I have hard in this laptop I was making a homemade rice video I have made my own homemade red enchilada sauce which I can do a tutorial on as well so my next step is to just heat my tortillas get my cheeses out get my plates ready I don't throw my enchiladas in the oven I'm not sure if that's like authentic or not because my family is in Mexico and we've never thrown enchiladas in the oven we've just kind of like put them in the microwave or whatever I'm supposed to I have thrown them in the oven before but they kind of just like mesh together and it's kind of hard to get like the single enchilada out or two at a time or whatever kind of turns into like an enchilada casserole which I cannot stand so I have my cheeses I'm gonna be using Moneray Jack and Munster this is what I have on hands normally I try to use two-all but cheese if you want Jesus if you don't have that on hand use Munster and Moneray Jack they're just as good so I'm going to get my tortillas ready and put my sauce in a bowl and my chicken is already shredded and I'll I have to charge my camera so I'll get all that settles and I will see you guys soon okay so now it's time to put the enchiladas together I had already gathered the cheese which is Moneray Jack and slice the Munster I'm gonna put the Moneray Jack inside of the enchilada because it's gonna melt a lot easier than the slices the slices are gonna go on top and that's gonna melt nicely because it's gonna be on the outside I have my shredded chicken which I told you I put in the slow cooker with a bunch of spices this is what it looks like when it's finished I used probably about six boneless skinless chicken breasts and then once I just like overnight for maybe like I don't know eight to ten hours so I did that so what I have here are some white corn tortillas you can use yellow corn you can use flour tortillas I suppose if you wanted to but like I said a lot of people tend to bake their enchiladas and I don't like to do that because it ends up turning into an enchilada casserole I like to be able to see the individual enchiladas and like in my previous video I have homemade rice here because as I said if you go to a Mexican restaurant an authentic one and you get authentic enchiladas with a homemade sauce and then you get canned beans and box rice on the side it kind of just like wounds a whole experience so this is just how you're gonna put it together a lot of people take their tortilla and dip it in oil before they do anything else that's just off in it up I don't like to do that because I feel like once you add cheese and if it's already fried in oil it just becomes like way too greasy for my liking so what I do is I just put it in the microwave for probably about like 40 seconds flip it to the other side this is the first first tortilla in the pack so it kind of gets a little bit shredded but about 40 seconds flip it to the other side just to get them soft enough to where you can bend them without breaking them so what I do from there is I just take it and I dip it into the sauce the sauce is warm slash hot and then put it on to your plate and then sometimes I use pork I use pork shoulder pork butts but this time I just use boneless skinless chicken because it was what I had on hand so just go ahead and put your chicken on there and then what I like to do is add some more sauce and I can do a tutorial like I said and how to do homemade sauce this is made with California chili pods so just add some more sauce and then like I said we're gonna put the monorijac cheese on it on the inside because it's gonna melt a lot easier it just depends how much meat you want in there how much cheese you want in there and then roll it up and then move on to your next one and if your tortilla seems a little like it doesn't want to bend or it seems like just not ready like once you put it in that warm sauce it's gonna like soften it up a little bit more for you so just put your chicken on there and then your cheese if you don't want to get your cheese vague journey like I am just put it in a bowl add your sauce just have like maybe I don't know a tablespoon or two and then roll it up so we've got two done as you can see you got the the chicken the cheese and some sauce and inside I dipped the tortilla right into the sauce after microwaving it because I didn't want to put it in oil so now that those are rolled up and ready to go I'm gonna tap it with the cheese now you can tap with any kind of cheese you like I just use the monorijac and monster because it's what I have on hand most of the time I like to use two of a cheese but I don't have that so I'm just working with whatever I have so we're just gonna take some monster cheese and this is just an off-brand monster cheese just stick it on there you don't want the paper on there as much as you want and then what I do is I put it on put on some more sauce and then it's up to you like most of these ingredients are hot like I let the cheese come to room temperature so it's not ice cold both the changes I let them come to room temperature now it's up to you what you want to do if you want to cover it and put it in the microwave you can I usually don't because most of my ingredients are either hot like you can see it's steaming or room temperature so just what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna put it in the microwave okay so this is what it should look like when you take it out of the microwave the cheese is just beginning to bubble the sauce is running when you take this out it's going to be hot so make sure you use some kind of hot holder or oven mix or something because it is hot now this is pretty much your finished product so what you do at this point is just add your side so like I make this homemade rice we're just gonna add this to as our side we're gonna drop some on the floor as well for the dog is and pretty much there's your homemade rice your homemade anchovadas with your homemade sauce your homemade try to chicken with your spices that I told you to add and this is what your final plate is gonna look like so if you guys want me to do a video on how I made my sauce or if you guys want me to do a video on homemade beans just let me know but pretty much just how your plate is gonna turn out and it's yummy so just dig in and enjoy
