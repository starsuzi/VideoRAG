 In Heritage Restoration and Design Studio specialty shop, we provide fine repairs and restoration to a wide variety of products. Today, we are refishing a 75-year-old piano, removing the old varnish and replacing it with a new lacquer-based coating. Replanting the project with the client, the piano is then moved to our location. It is now carefully disassembled to allow access to the various parts that require refinished. A stripping compound is applied to the components. Then they are left to sit. The compound is then scraped off, removing the old finish and exposing the original wood grain. A similar process is then applied to remove the worn manufacturer's detail. The parts are then hand rubbed and smooth. A lacquer solvent is added as a final improvement to the cleaning process. Heritage is careful to protect the sensitive inner workings of the pianos that we service. The company that manufactures this piano closed in the 1960s, but that is no problem. Heritage Restoration and Design Studio has the ability to apply the accurate decals for antique pianos. The parts are then taken to our spray booth. Here we apply as many coats of lacquer as the client specifies. This piano requires up to six. The components are then left to cure for two to three days. Once the curing is complete, the piano is reassembled for inspection. Once it passes, it undergoes a final tuning and other small repairs to the inner workings. After a final once-over, the repairs are complete. Now the piano looks and sounds great. The piano is now ready to be finished. The piano is now ready to be finished.
