 To DC then dies a tomato. You first want to cut it into quarters. Now as you can see here I'm using a Roma tomato, but this will work which is about any type of tomato out there. Now you're going to lay it skin side down, flesh side up, and while applying pressure with the side of your knife against that tomato flesh, you're going to slide your knife through that seed pod and DC the tomato. You're going to lay it flesh side up again and see how I'm going to use my index finger here. That's going to make that knife an extension of my finger. I'm going to go ahead and just draw it back. I'm using my middle finger to come over and it's going to hold my strips together which is going to make it easier to dies. Then I'm going to square off the ends because I'm going to do a dice here. And then again I'm going to use that polling motion to hold it together because it's going to allow me to visualize the dice much easier. Now as you can see here we have a simple tomato dice. You can also easily julienne the tomato by simply cutting it into thin strips using a rocking slicing motion and a really tight guide hand technique.
