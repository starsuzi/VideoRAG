 Watered they don't need to be standing in water. They won't last for very long You get root right then right and and then also they they will typically Dry out really quick so they are heavy water users you just have to find that bound especially if you're by the furnace That was exactly okay now for those who like the challenge and want to see if they can make them re bloom or restart Is that doable well if you're a green thumb? You really want to go to a little extra effort you can make them come back next year as beautiful as they were this year Right and there's a little process you have to go through Okay, you really when the leaves do fall off you kind of put them back in a cool environment Maybe a basement or a storm shelter or something like that and and let them stay there until spring and then in early spring You can come back and actually prune these back you want to repot the plant then okay Prune them back to about six inches or so and the stems should be about six inches and then Put them in a sunny window and and let them kind of Thrive there in that sunny window later you can take them out through the summer if you'll take care of them Okay, and keep them in partial shade through the summer outside But then before frost comes you want to bring them back in and here's the hard part Okay, you have to come in and and put them in darkness for about 14 hours in the night at about 60 degree Camperchers, so here we're talking to something a nursery is prepared to exactly what they can do and you have to do that from October 1st so about Thanksgiving so it's if you want them to get back to this color again That's what it takes. I'm gonna guess the University Extension has a handout for us who didn't get it written down So we do we have a guide sheet You know, we always have guide sheet Okay, I'll call you in local Extension office for a guide sheet. Okay, happy to your Tim. Thanks for coming to see us in the Point said advice. That was great
