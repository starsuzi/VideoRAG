 What is going on I hope everyone is having a great day and today we're gonna be upgrading a solo base but the end of the video your base is gonna look just like this so first off you are gonna want to find a location that is very hidden and very easily defendable for the purpose of the video I just made it on a flat terrain but make sure you find a really really good hidden location all right for phase one I'm just gonna be making a normal wooden base this is kind of like the best base in my opinion that you can really get when you're first starting out like under level 15 so obviously there are still servers like extinction and arctic apocalypse that are being reset like every 30 days so obviously you can make one of these bases in those 30 days and if you can get tech kudos you bro you got tech but I don't know if you're gonna make it up to tech but hopefully if you're a solo player on extinction or arctic apocalypse or maybe just on official you can try to replicate what I do here so anyways I'm just gonna go into a little montage of music so just sit back relax and enjoy all right so this is the best base I could really make with all materials for like starters I mean you have like basic barriers like the the gates to keep people from like shooting at your teams and just some basic spikes nothing too good but you know I had to make it an upgrade and this is what you're gonna start out with so let's just first off let's just get rid of that absolute crap because no one's really gonna be using that and let's move on to phase two all right for phase two here we're gonna move on to stone so this is more realistic this is probably what you're gonna be on for so make sure you start off by lowering a foundation three down so follow everything I just did right there how I put like that foundation off to the side at the upper level and then after you lower one of the foundations down three times do that just follow what I did right there if it was a little confusing just go back in the video pause it so only one foundation is lowered three times in the restaurant average high just to kind of sum it up but anyways what the reason why I did lower that foundation is so that I can put large storage boxes there as you can see because usually it can't fit in a one by like a one high base but if you lower the foundation and then you place another foundation over it you see oh look at that Naroku figured something out for once so yeah so now let's go on to the interior of this base it is a small base thing as it is solo so it is just a two by two with some actually a lot of storage in there kind of but um so I'm just gonna start out by putting a smithy over in the corner so obviously you should destroy that so you can get it as close to the wall as you can to save as much space as you can and then you know you can place everything else wherever you want to place it I'm not really good at interior design but you can follow these steps if you really want to but I'm just gonna keep playing some dope music all right so that is what the base is gonna look like if you did do it correctly it should just look like a tiny little base super compact inside though so what I'm doing on top here is I'm putting some pillars for plant species so it kind of looks like I just flopped a little pancake on top of the base with plant species it looks sick and it is really good at defending so I have used this basis I have used this base design in an extinction server it worked it worked really well um especially how I upgraded it but anyways if you follow it there I put catwalk sideways and then I put four more plant species and then what you're gonna want to do is place out three pillars so find the snap point and go out three pillars so that's one two and then you're gonna want to go out one more and then from there you're gonna want to start building around the base so make sure it's three pillars out from the base and it should be all even nice and perfect if you do do it correctly so you're gonna want to make it at least too high three well I did it to here and two seems to work fine just because it keeps out like trikes and enemy large dino so it's nothing like super intense but you know it just keeps the dino out and it keeps your plant species from getting easily eaten or hit so it doesn't take damage but anyways here I'm gonna be placing on each of the corners kind of like a little guard tower on each corner just some plant species X and what this is gonna do is you know give it some range give the outer defenses a little bit more range like I said but yeah god I'm repeating what I'm saying but anyways so now what you gonna gonna want to do is place some more large crop plots on the bottom next to the base kind of in the corners just the more you have the better because you have a hundred you have a hundred turrets in a range of like I forget how many foundations but you have a ton of turrets so use all of them to your advantage put as many plants as you want as you're in this phase just because you don't really have turrets yet at this phase so you are gonna want to use as many plant species as you can so right here I'm just showing off the interior of the base but anyways that is it for phase two moving on to phase three here what we're gonna do first is turn all the stone into metal just do exactly what I did for phase two but just turn everything into metal so it's really simple you just have to go throughout the base demolish all the stone and put metal instead it's super simple but there is one thing we're gonna be changing which is the vault so instead of having those three storage boxes change it out for a vault all you have to do is demolish your storage boxes put a vault down and then place the foundation back and yeah it's it it's pretty simple super simple I just made a little upgrade just because you know why have a three storage boxes when you can just have one huge vault so the vault does kind of stick out the top as you see there but you know it's not really gonna make a difference just because the vault has a ton of health anyways and it's gonna be popping out a little bit but I mean there's so many defenses around you could probably lower the foundation even more and get it hidden if you wanted to but I didn't really do it in the video but anyways now what we're doing here is demolishing all those plants on the side of the base and putting catwalks metal catwalks instead so what these do you can use them for a variety of things you can put plant species on it but what I did here was put auto-tarts so auto-tarts are great and at this level you're definitely gonna want to have as many auto-tarts as you can put on this base so sorry I am stuttering a little bit I don't know I think I have like I don't it's her at spraw so I put like four on each side so one two three that's like 16 so I've 16 turrets on the base itself and then I am gonna show you a little bit of a secret super six secret later but anyways place a generator on the inside and then you should be able to power on all of those just by that one generator and then after you do that start placing metal pillars on the outside and this is what your base should look like if you did it right well just take it in look at that sexiness oh yeah all right so now moving on we're gonna be placing some auto-tarts on the outside so look at this so you have those pillars you're like now what do we do with them that's right you place auto-tarts look at this base design just step back for a minute and just admire the base design like oh just really think about that you are gonna have to extend the extend the wires out a little bit and I didn't put the turrets all the way around but you know you can put them all around all right so now for phase number four not everyone is gonna have tech but if you do have tech I wanted to include it in here so this is solo base design for tech so all you can want to do is just do the same thing for phase number three or that I did in phase number three just replace everything with tech it's super simple I'm not doing any modifications this time except one thing which is getting rid of all the normal turrets and adding in the modified turrets like the really really buffed off buffed up turrets I can't remember what the name is off top my head but yeah I get those new turrets in there not just the regular auto-tarts and then place a tech oh what is the name of this thing a tech force field I think yeah tech force field on top so the shield thing this force field what it's gonna do is put like a shield around your base it takes like five minutes to activate but we'll get back to that once it does activate but start placing the heavy turrets around the base as I do here once again just place it where all the auto-tarts were before and then if you do want place it on the outside and this is gonna make your solo base very very defended as you can see it's just it's just freaking visibly but look at this look at this I am I'm not matching with this if I come across it plus I didn't even use all the turrets like you have a hundred tarot limit but I didn't even use all of it anyways so moving on here this is what it looks like this is what the base design looks like fully finished you got the tech shield thingy mediggy thing on top you can play around like the distances to make it larger or smaller whatever you want so you could make it really large and get it around the whole solo base it's insane it honestly is insane look at this thing so this is gonna be your tech base for solo I've never done one of these before so if you did find it helpful or you just wanted to chill back watch some neroku videos you know you found entertaining just to watch make sure to leave a like because they know not many people are gonna be getting tech but anyways if you haven't already make sure you subscribe because I upload bangers every single day I'll see you guys in my next video peace
