 Hi everyone welcome back to where the Nums live. Today we're making liquid starch. The only reason I make liquid starch is because it's called for in a paper mache paste recipe that I have here on YouTube. You can buy liquid starch already made but this is way cheaper. So if you have cornstarch in your cupboard right now all you need is that some water and a pot and about five minutes you'll have a cup full of liquid starch. I'm just going to take a cup of water and I'm going to set that to boil. Put that on high while I mix up my cornstarch and I just take one tablespoon and I'll dissolve this into some warm water and we're just going to dissolve that cornstarch until there's no powder left. Okay my water is boiling so I just take that off and I will just pour in my cornstarch and just stir that up. So now I'm going to put it back on the burner but I'm going to turn the burner down. Turn it down to about medium high and just give that a stir and you'll see that it's starting to thicken up and that's what we wanted and that's how easy it is to make the liquid cornstarch. I just let that boil just for about about a minute I guess. Don't eat the boil at that heart. So that's all there is to that and that's about done. So I'm just going to let that cool down now. There our liquid starch is cooled down and it's ready to go into our next step.
