 Hello, lovely viewer. Meet the leak. Leak. Meet my lovely viewer. You can find leaks in the produce section. They look somewhat like an overgrown scallion or green onion. Got lots of little layers in the middle, just like an onion. In the onion family, it's a little more mild than an onion. This is what you'll see when you're in the store. These big, weird looking things. See, these big outer leaves on the top, the dark parts. Those are ones you just want to discard. They're no good, but inside sometimes there's some good stuff. Leaks are also very dirty from the way that they grow in the ground. So you want to get rid of that dirt. So slice that beautiful leak in half. You'll see all those layers down there. There's a lot of dirt that tends to get stuck in there. As you can see at the top here, but typically down at the bottom too. So try to see if you can chop as fast as I can. Makes it a lot easier. Put all of those chopped pieces right into a huge bowl. Fill it with water and then just kind of move it around. As you're mixing it a little bit, that dirt will sink to the bottom. You can do this once, two, times, three times whatever you like and then just drain. Your leaks are ready to use. You'll find leaks used in soups or stews or things like that or even stir-fried. Lots of different ways you can use them. They are just delicious. And here is a veggie burger recipe that you can use them in that I made. Thanks for watching. Bye.
