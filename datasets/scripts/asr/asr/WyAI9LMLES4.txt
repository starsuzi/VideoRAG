 Hi, I'm Tiny Steel of Epicurius.com and you're watching Around the World in 80 Dishes. Today we're exploring the Hungarian-Dish Gulash. It's a really iconic dish from Hungary and Chef Tom Griffiths from the Conor Institute of America is here to show us how to make it. Chef, I love Gulash because it's very hardy. It's very kind of, it's a beautiful thing to have on a winter's day. I think Gulash is a really good hardy dish to have and it's especially good the next day. Oh, yes. Is that because the flavors have come together? Especially this with all the spices from the peppers, roasted peppers and the spices. Yeah. Much better the next day. Oh, interesting. We'll make double. Excellent. That's what I want to hear. Okay, so what do we do? We have dried wild mushrooms. Yeah. These are called saps and you're going to pour hot water on them and make a concert too with them. Now this is something that you see in recipes all the time about reconstituting dried mushrooms. You can buy a huge thing of mushrooms and just cut them up or crumble them and put them into hot water. Like a tea. Exactly, and then 30 minutes later, right? They're pretty much ready to... Looks like this. Conditioned our pan. Okay. Really high. Alright, so I'm going to use some oil, just regular vegetable oil. A little bit of oil. Yep. And we're going to use a tender cut of oil. A little salt and pepper. Okay. So we're going to brown the veal. Yeah. And it's important to get each piece nice and brown. This is hot, smoking hot. Yeah. That's what we want. Okay. To get a good sear on it. See how I spread it out? Yeah. Are you going to help? I kind of like walking you through. You do? I'm relaxed right now. Alright, relax. We're going to take it. And we just want to turn over some of the pieces. See how nice and brown they got? Yeah. See how we're trying to get a little browning on the bottom? Yep. That's really good. Okay. So this is caramelizing as well. I mean, that essentially what this is? Yeah, caramelizing. Just caramelizing. This veal is just browned barely through. The next step we're going to take the veal out. And then we're going to sweat shallot, onions and garlic, and get more flavor. Okay. And then we're going to add flour and make a little roux. That's our thickening. Okay. Okay. Now, this looks like a lot of oil, but we need the oil to thicken the flour. I see. So you'll see in a little bit that it's going to be gone. Very good. So we're going to just put that someplace in the rest. Okay. Do you want to stir? Sure. It's important that we slice all the onions evenly so they cook evenly. Okay. And the garlic for this dish we want to mince fine so it kind of gives an aromatic bath flavor, not a front flavor. Okay. And I'm going to add a little flour. This is going to cook out for a pretty good period of time. Right now, the aromatics are letting out like onion water and onion garlic water. They're really mostly moisture. So that's, can you see a little bit of splattering from that? Yes. That's good that you're kind of scooping up all the fount. Yeah. You have the fount. I am. I love the fount. You do? And the founts. And paprika. And paprika. Pepperic is a big part of the Hungarian cooking. Yeah. And the roasted pepper. So that's one of the real classic taste flavors of Hungarian cuisine. Is that paprika taste? Yeah. These are mushrooms that we were constituted and diced up earlier. Okay. They go in next. And now I'm very slowly going to add in the mushroom tea. Okay. This is cold. This is hot. So it's going to not be lumpy. If we had this hot and this hot, you'd get little lumps from the flour. Oh, wow. And then pull a little bit off the fire. Yeah. Right? So interesting. Yeah. I had no idea that that was the case. No lumps. Wow. And the last is the little tomato paste. Is this just thickening it? Just a nice sweet flavor to it. Okay. Tomato paste is one of those things that such a good thing to have in the back room. It's a good way to be refrigerated. It's just as a staple to slow into things. Taste a little bit. Oh, yeah. What do you think? I think it needs some salt and pepper. Okay. And if you want, you can certainly add chicken stock or chicken broth or a meal broth to this too. So you're going to add those back in. Add the meal back in. And we're going to cook it very, very slowly. Okay. So it's fork tender. So while this is cooking, it's a good idea to then multitask by cooking the egg noodles. And roast in the peppers. Beautiful. Okay. So that's what we're going to do in the next video.
