 Hi, in this video I will show you how to make this bracelet. It's called mini rainbow limb bracelet. Let's get started. We're going to use the mini rainbow limb that's provided in the kit. We need about 45 to 50 rubber bands. You get the mini rainbow limb and one rubber band. Put the rubber band on one of the pegs, wrap it around the second peg, then put it back on the first peg. It should look like this. Put a sea clip on the side where we first put the rubber band. Like that. Dislip the hook on the other side of the limb. Then grab two rubber bands and place it on your hook. Pull it through and then place it back on your hook. It should look like this. Get another rubber band, place it on the hook, turn it so that the hook is facing down and pull it through. When looping back, hold the turquoise rubber band with your finger. Then pick up the purple rubber band along with the other end of the turquoise. Put a pink rubber band on the hook, twist the hook and pull it through the rubber bands. When looping back, pick the turquoise rubber band and the other end of the pink rubber band. Let's do this one more time. Put the purple rubber band on the hook, twist the hook so that it's facing down, pull it through all the rubber bands and then pick up the pink rubber band and the other end of the purple rubber band. Repeat this step until it's song enough for your wrist. If the first rubber band sits off the loom, just loop it back like that. And continue making the bracelet. After you made your bracelet to the desired length, get a rubber band and loop it through like you would for a single link. Join the last rubber band to the secret.
