 We're going down here at the 23rd of March and I just want to show you the Cape Gusebris. Cape Gusebris. At least parts are from last year and we've overwintered them in the conservatory because what I found with Cape Gusebrises, in the UK I don't think the season is long enough. I grew some year before last and they got to the stage where they got these, they got the Gusebris bits but you know by sort of September, October they were about this stage and then they never actually ripened. I put a greenhouse over them and that but they never worked. But I saw what's happened with these. These are some plants that have been brought from a nursery and like last year and then they've been kept going or winter. Hopefully now they'll have a good jump start so as we actually get some fruit from them and they've got lots of new growth coming down here so we are now a huge bush to go in the, I'll keep it all in the greenhouse. Over the flowers and what we found we have to do is just go around with a tissue or paintbrush and go around fertilising one from the other because obviously we don't have any bees in the conservatory. There you have it. The reins are from Christmas decorations on it here as well look. So great hopes for Cape Gusebris this year but if you're growing them, be sure to be prepared to overwinter them I would say because I don't think the season's wrong enough in the UK to actually get them. Alright, it's all for now. Bye for now.
