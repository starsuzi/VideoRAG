 Hey everybody, Hunter Fisher Trapper Traitor Guides Gout and Interpreter and Country Cook Steve, all here in Nashville, Tennessee, along with pretty Miss Sheila running that camera. Hey Sheila! Today we're gonna do something real special and this is really an interesting story behind this. We're gonna make some Dyer's deep fried burgers but we're not gonna be able to do what they do because the oil that they have in there is the grease from the hamburgers that they cook is 103 years old if you can believe that. They've got a big container that's like two feet by three feet and it's about that deep with a hamburger fat that is cooked through the years and each day they take it and strain it at the end of the day then they heat it back up the next day and they actually deep fry their hamburgers in it. When they moved from one location to the next they actually had arm guards that went with them because they had that 103 year old grease in it like a trash can they carried it in then poured it in their new cooker to start all over again. We're gonna try to do that and here's what you want to get. You want to do what they do. Don't buy good premium burger. I know that sounds crazy. Don't even buy 80-20. They use 73% lean 27% fat because they want those burgers to produce more fat every time they cook it so it keeps putting it in there, putting it in there, putting it in there and eventually I suppose it would get to the point where you'd have to throw some of it away because it would have too much but I took a three pound bag of that 73-27 burger and I cooked it and cooked it and cooked it and cooked it and then I took the burger and threw it in the freezer. I can always use it for talk, it wasn't everything else but I've got that grease in here and I've got these burgers and we're gonna try to deep fry them like Dyer's hamburgers do. Come on over let's see if we can pull this off. Now you'll notice that my grease is not as deep as there's is obviously theirs is like real deep so you can drop it right in. I've got this kind of heated up already and I'm gonna lay these in here. Now they've got a special spatula they use to smash their three ounces of burger flat and they do like a double double they put like a burger cheese, burger cheese inside of a hamburger bun. We're gonna try to pull that off a little bit. We might make a double double then we might make a couple of singles but they smash it flat. I took a half cup measuring cup and I leveled it full and I took a little bit of hamburger out of there because a little half cup is four ounces and they use two three ounce burger patties. So let's see and I took those little three ounce bits and smashed them flat in between some wax paper what is that parchment paper and this looks like it's just about ready so I'm gonna get these in here. Yes it's a deep fried burger Now normally if I had their 103 year old grease which they won't part with that would be completely underneath the grease and I'm gonna save this every time I cook it from burger time to burger time to burger time let me bring this down to about high or even medium high and I'm gonna strain this when it cools out and I'm gonna put it in the freezer and the next time I'm gonna keep using it and using it and using it because it becomes a concentrated delicious burger fat base that these cook in and I'm gonna turn these quite often because I'm trying to accomplish the same thing that they got which is deep frying them and to help settle my grease down just a little bit I think I'll pop another one in there. I'm daring don't use your fingers I just do that stuff but I got one more over here but that's what they do then they actually take their cheese pick one of those out lay it on and then they scoop it down underneath the grease and pick up the next burger because they want a omtelnia roadside greasy hamburger and everybody comes from miles around to get them so we're gonna try to duplicate that a little bit I'm not sure I'm gonna try to do the underneath because I don't have enough of that grease developed yet but and I probably won't be here 103 years from now to have it but and if you ever get down to a Memphis go check out Dyer's hamburgers and I'm kind of prepping my kind of prepping my cheese here getting ready and I'm just gonna lay these over on this plate and then I'm gonna go grab our hamburger buns that we made homemade that's right we made homemade hamburger buns and they look terrific and they're in the other room and they're gonna be part of two recipes this one and the hamburger bun recipe because we got to show what we do with it after we make it and here's something else they do they say now see as thin as I smash these flat they're still kind of rounding up a little bit I always use the term hockey puck but they're little thin flat ones they got them super thin when they put them in there so I'm gonna pull these a little bit early because I like mine kind of medium rare anyway and I'm gonna do what they do and that's pull her right out of the fat flop the cheese right on top do the same thing deep fried hamburgers and I'm gonna keep this grease and I use that 7327 not good old 80 20 but and this is really kind of cool because you can use the cheapest burger that they got on sale at the store I bought a three pound bag and it was like eight dollars and 29 cents up here at food line if I can get him to slide over perfect there you have it man we're looking at a 103 year old recipe where they keep using it over and over and over again and I would assume that you want to make sure that you don't get it so hot that you burn anything but they strain it out anyway so let me move this from medium down to medium high down to medium so I just want to finish up this one let's see sheela likes hers hamburgers medium to medium well me I can well I can just eat this the way it is I like them rare so I'm gonna pull this one out early because I want him just the way I want him and let's get our hamburger buns in here and let's start making some of those double doubles as they call them well all right let me explain these buns I got great big hamburger buns if I'd have made a little smaller they'd have been a little taller if I'd let the dough rise for an hour first then let them rise after I made them into hamburgers they would have went a little higher but I love the fact that they're nice great big hamburger buns but I got a problem because I didn't know that when you deep fried hamburgers you better start that big if you want that big so let me give you some information when they're down they're making their hamburgers down at dyers they put mustard on here and they put onions on it now you're ready for this and they say if you want lettuce or tomato go next door they make salads over there they don't have no lettuce and no tomato in their restaurant can you believe that mustard and onions only now I got thinking what if we put one in the middle but what if we put two of them I think we better stay with one in the middle here so we're going to make because we have a nice big flat bun we can do one of their double doubles as they call them and I'm going to give that a mash perfect same thing with this one here you need a good hearty bun to hold up to this grease stuff but there you have it let me blow that off to make sure it looks good on camera because it's got to look good when we put it on YouTube what do you think Sheila it's great there what you missing something all right she's cleaning it up she's my little director so there we go deep fried double-decker hamburgers this way this way right there's that look good all right there you have it and no tomatoes and no lettuce double-decker hamburgers on homemade buns that we made ourselves and we're going to modify that recipe and believe it or not this is ending up at the end of our hamburger YouTube video and it's also ending up at the end of our hamburger bun YouTube video so again for those that I told to do it like 25 or 30 minutes let the dough rise originally that we made in the mixer for an hour then when you shape them into the burgers I made them real big and flat and I like these because I want to make a nice big hamburger in the future but I'll rise it for an hour then let it set shaped and rise another hour then bake at 350 degrees until they're golden brown with the sesame and I think we got a something here don't have to buy the 80-20 no more when it comes to hamburger get the 73% lean 27% fat so when you cook them flat little thin burgers and make them as thin and as big as you can make them because when you dunk them in here they zing right up and fit perfect these were a little smaller so I went double-decker next time I'm making them bigger and I'm going to go single-level but I couldn't be happier with the burgers I couldn't be happier with the buns we're looking forward to a great dinner and if you'd like to subscribe to our channel little shotgun reds face is going to pop up right over here in just a little bit we're going to put another recipe over here in fact you know what I'm going to do I think I'm going to put the hamburger bun recipe over here and on the hamburger recipe video I'm going to put the hamburger recipe and well you know what I'm trying to say Sheila is this the best hamburgers you've ever seen deep fried if they ain't they ought to be great job on the camera we'll see you next time right here on cooking with shotgun red hope you subscribe to our channel time to dive in no lettuce and no tomatoes
