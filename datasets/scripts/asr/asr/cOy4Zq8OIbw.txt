 Whether you're making these as part of an Indian feast or if you're just looking for something to snack on at your next party These little babies will be a sure-fire hit. Let's make some beef and potato curry puffs on the one part chef In a saucepan over medium heat I've got a little bit of oil and two of them I'm going to add in one brown onion which I've peeled and chopped One clove of garlic which has been crushed and we're just going to cook that stirring for about two to three Minutes or until the onions have softened next I'm adding in some curry paste I'm putting in a tablespoon of quorum of paste now if you don't have curry paste You could just use a bit of curry powder and add in some herbs and spices of your choice Now I'm just going to stir that through for about a minute until it's nice and aromatic next We're adding in our meat 250 grams of beef mince and two small potatoes Which I've just peeled and chopped up nice and finely I'm just going to break that beef up and then we're just going to allow this to cook for about 8 to 10 minutes until the beef is nice and browned and the potatoes are nice and tender That's looking good. So we're just going to turn off the heat and we're going to set this aside for about half an hour or until it's nice and cool I've got three sheets of ready-rolled frozen puff pastry which I've just allowed to thaw out and using a large cookie cutter We're just going to cut out pastry circles Take one circle at a time and just wet the edge with a little bit of water I'm going to put in one Heaped teaspoon full of our mixture directly in the center Then simply fold it in half and pinch the edges together so it's nice and sealed Perfect, so we're just going to put this onto a plate and continue with the rest I made about 24 of these gorgeous little babies so we are ready to fry these up in the wok Let's start frying up our little curry puffs. Now, I've got some vegetable oil in my wok You could also use a large saucepan if you like and all we're going to do is we heat up this oil to about 170 degrees Celsius But if you don't have a thermometer Don't panic all you need to do is drop a tiny little bit of bread into the oil and if it Fizzles up and goes nice and golden and crisp within about 10 seconds the oil is perfectly hot So we're just going to put some of our curry puffs into the oil like so I recommend only doing about six at a time because you don't want to crowd the wok too much But basically all we're going to do is allow these to cook in the oil for about Maybe three to four minutes until they're puffed up and golden and gorgeous looking Then you can just gently transfer them onto a tray lined with some kitchen paper We'll get rid of any of that excess oil and then just continue on with the rest Yeah, looking just about done so So just lift them out allow them to drain for a second And then place them onto the tray Golden and puffed with that little hint of spice These beautiful curry puffs will be a big hit at your next party How gorgeous are these little babies?
