 Today on Starbucks Crazy, I'm gonna have you seeing a red. Hello, my name is Nancy and by now you know that I'm Starbucks Crazy. Today we're gonna be trying out a raspberry white chocolate mocha. Today I'm back at the late night Starbucks here in Huntington Beach on the corner of Yorktown and Maine. It's the morning and I wanted something special for you guys. I wanted to get you something that wasn't on the menu. So I ordered white chocolate mocha which is regular white mocha with four shots of raspberry syrup. It is a raspberry syrup that gives it that nice red glow. Alright everybody, we're at the late night Starbucks here in Huntington Beach and I wanted something special. I ordered white chocolate mocha with raspberry syrup. So see how it tastes. Hi to everybody, I've had it. I've had this before actually and it tastes mood like a white chocolate mocha but it has its sweetness of the raspberry syrup. And I really like it. There's coffee in this and four pumps of raspberry syrup and of course the coffee is two shots of espresso which is what's normal on a rendezvous. I ordered it late which queen. That's why there wasn't that much on top. I'm trying to watch my weight and of course I got it with low fat milk. But that can be customized to your taste and to your needs. This is what happened to have been my need. I need to lose a couple of pounds for Christmas. Anyhow, if you get this, I hope you will enjoy it. I remember when they were doing the sand flavors for the frappuccinos. They did use a lot of raspberry syrup and it is quick good. I enjoyed it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you from Nancy at Starbucks Crazy.
