 This is a demonstration on how to make a citronella and lemon grass soil candle. I've taken a piece of candle wick, then pushed it through the metal sustainer and clamped it with a pair of pliers. I've secured the bottom of the sustainer with a little bit of silicone to the bottom of the glass. Add your soil wax to your pot and a lot of melt over low heat. Once your soil wax is melted, you can add your citronella and lemon grass essential oils. The next step is to pour the wax into the glass holding the wick upright. We've waited about half an hour. You can now move the wick into the centre of the candle and it should stay there.
