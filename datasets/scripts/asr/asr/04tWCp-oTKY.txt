 So we just get our milk to a simmering point. Once it's up to heat, we just drop our smoked cod in there and we just start to get it up to simmer again and then we can let the fish sit in there for about six, seven minutes and we drop the egg in a couple minutes after for four or five minutes and get a perfect poached egg as well. And the milk has that smoky flavour from the fish so your eggs get that flavour as well. So we're going to have this like egg-spended egg to tie it dish with a smoked cod, serve it on a muffin and then we will make this holiday sauce which you can buy from Fish Munger, finish with a few chives. It's incredibly tasty and really simple, all in one pan.
