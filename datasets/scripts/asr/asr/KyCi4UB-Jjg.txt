FEGENIC MUSIC There's a lot of vanilla production in the world, which is mostly traditional production systems in the tropics, but to really control the environment and to know what set points actually are better or more controlled than in an open field has not been done before. It is important to challenge the vanilla sector to develop. It is important for greenhouse horticulture in the Netherlands to find new earning models. It is important for the market as a whole, so we work in our consortium as a grower that uses geothermic heat, so very sustainable heat source. So through that and in that we just further make a sustainable product. We manage the growth of vanilla here through indeed a good balance of irrigation, of humidity, of overhead sprinkling. So you see those air routes they need to get nutrition and water, but you don't want to over irrigate it because you'll get a lot of molds in the greenhouse. Well that balance was the trick and was the focal point of our research. I think we managed to grow a very uniform product. It is more controlled, definitely in the supply chain. We can be a reliable partner. We have a better expectation of what we produce in terms of volumes and quality, and especially when you trade with Western partners, we are an easier partner to work with.
