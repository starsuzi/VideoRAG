 Hello youtubers this is the guaranteed way to get rid of your gofer and mold problems this is what they have really destroyed my yard just look at this that's one that's two that's three four five six seven eight nine they've really destroyed my yard ten let's go around the fence and you see where they're coming from those are some huge ones going out to the street end up tried poisoning them I've tried flooding them pretty much tried everything grab worms poison catching them but they keep on coming back I realized one way to get rid of them for good and this is sorry for the animal activists but this is the best way to do it I'm using my truck it's a 1971 Ford F1 F700 so hooked up the pipe right there right on the exhaust it's coming all the way then you have to find find one of the gofer mounds kind of like this one right here you have to dig in all the way make a big hole and keep on poking in the in the in the on the surrounding hole until you find where the tunnels go could could be going this way could be going that way or this way so what I found out is they come from that direction so you just have to follow the pattern you see that one right there that's one two three that's kind of like they're out so I found out the tunnel it goes this way so I dug a big hole and then inside I found the tunnel and I hooked up this pipe going to the exhaust and you know this is one of those old trucks 1971 so they really have a lot of carbon monoxide you know so it goes in it because they are right in there and then I make sure I seal the hole going into the tunnel so I just let the car run and the exhaust fumes will just keep on going in the hole for some time so you just gotta leave it for 20 30 40 minutes depending on how bad this gof is are they will destroy your yard that's for sure they will destroy it if you don't take care of them right away at first I saw the one way over there that's where they started I was really lazy I didn't do anything then I saw another one right there I didn't do anything now they keep on advancing into my into my yard and this is my last this is the last hole so this is where you begin the last hole into your yard that's your first line of defense right there so you you are guessing going into your into your yard and then you guess them going back where they came from so so you have to guess those two times the one going into your yard on the last hole and the one the one going coming for the origin going on the other side and I did this about two years ago they did not mess around in my yard for the for the last two years now they came back now I got to deal with them I've spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars with grab warms traps you name it everything that I could try even flooding them that nothing nothing really worked but my my big beast over here is what I use for for gassing them and it's really been helping me and it's just been sitting here this is my land life first line of defense because they keep on coming from that side or that side of the street so my truck is always part here I don't drive it much it's it's only used to kill gophers that's it so my first line of defense is right there that's where my truck parks every year and I tackle them and I make sure they don't mess up my yard that is my yard right there and I will never want to have a mess up my yard so this is my first line of defense and I've declared war against this gophers and I will win that is for sure and they will not come back again for the next who knows hopefully forever but you know that's not true they will come back again but this year I will this is how you kill them just gassing but you need a car that has a lot of carbon monoxide especially classical cars or older cars that's what's gonna get them good luck on your on your gophers killing gophers problems if you have gophers problems that's this is the best way to do them and it's guaranteed you can only spend gas maybe $20 and that's it okay good luck
