 Hi this is Skogget and today I'm going to show you how to align the bottom of a spring form pan with parchment paper. When it comes to doing this it's not hard at all and I'll show you the way I do it do it in my way and show you how I go about doing it. A spring form pan is one of these pan's what has the little latch on it and then has the inside here and let me go ahead and show you how I do this my way and it's easy I mean it's not rocket science and this is way always do it. Now you have your parchment paper here and your spring form pan. Well you get the parchment paper and what you need to do is just line the bottom of this pan here so it's like well how do I do that do I push this down in there or you know do I how do I how do I do it well most people will take the like a pencil or a pen and draw a circle and draw away around to fit the bottom of the pan then cut it out all the way around and put it inside the pan well that's fine it's nothing wrong with doing it like that but I'm going to show you in easier way the way I do it. What I do is I take take the bottom of the pan and put the parchment paper just on on top like this then I take the pan and I line it up on the bottom just like this gotta make sure that it locks in and it locks in just like this then I'll what you've got to do is take it and you can just if if you want to you can take it nice and go around the bottom of it just like this or if you don't have have a knife you can also pair it around just like this there you can see that it's on the bottom just where you need it and it's also held tight because the paper as sealed it let me get a camera the paper has also kind of sealed it so when it's locked in then it's the stuff won't leak through sometimes it leaks through where this paper will keep it from doing that and that's why I do do it whenever I want to line up springform a foreign pan you can do it however way you're used to doing it this is just for me it's an easy way to do it I thought I'd share it with you guys and of course you can do it your way this way I do it this is my way appreciate all your viewers all your subscribers out there and y'all take care
