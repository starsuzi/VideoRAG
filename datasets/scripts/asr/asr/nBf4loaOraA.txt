 What's up everybody today? I'm showing you 10 fun and really easy ways to ice and cupcake My name is Laurie and you're watching My Zartus So we're gonna be making 10 different cupcake designs using five different piping tips to kick things off We're going to be making the classic swirl and the short twist For these cupcakes, I'm using yellow buttercream icing and a number 829 piping tip The classic swirl and I placed my piping bag onto the cupcake and start swirling around Now this cupcake is gonna have heights. You want to keep swirling as you're kind of moving out the cupcake As you get to the top you want to release the pressure from your piping bag and then just pull away I love this cupcake. It's almost like a classic bakery cupcake look and it's super pretty For the short twist you're doing a very similar thing except we're not gonna have as much height So you're just gonna start at the cupcake and you had to swirl around once and once you've got that first swirl You want to just kind of come around and start your pressure and pull like big off your cupcake Still has that really classic look without all of the icing Next up, I'm gonna show you guys how to make the perfectly round and the dollop To make these cupcakes, I'm gonna use some light blue buttercream and a number 809 piping tip But the perfectly round and just gonna place the piping tip onto the cupcake and just kind of swirl around Very similar to the short twist You want to stop the pressure and just burl the stuff of the cupcake This again is one of the classic bakery cupcakes. I love how traditional and beautiful it looks For the dollop, it's really just that you just want to squeeze a dollop of icing and then release off And you're just gonna have a perfect little and then icing on your cupcake Next up we have two of my favorite cupcakes designs We are going to be making the beautiful rose bat and the one and wave For this, I'm using some light pink buttercream and a one-in piping tip For the rest of that, you want to start in right in the center of the cupcake And you want to start applying a little bit of pressure kind of swirling around You want me very careful as you're swirling around keeping it as centered as you can and when you're done You're gonna have almost a beautiful rose on your cupcake That cupcake is beautiful by itself Or you can always do it in a cupcake Okay, because it really does look like a pretty flower For the one and wave you want to start very slowly So you're just applying pressure and allowing the tip kind of doing the work for you Swirling around the cupcake that going very slowly, so it allows all of those like ruffles kind of wave out on you I love this. It's kind of like a soft kind of messy look, but it's really really pretty to make it even more classic You always add a little bit of drojase or you know those ball things that are called drojase Next up is something a little bit more fun. We're gonna be making the ice cream swirl and then the petal For these two cupcakes, I'm using a light purple buttercream and a number two A piping tip For the ice cream swirl, you just want to start on the side of the cupcake And you're really just swirling swirling swirling going all the way around the cupcake until you reach the top This design also works perfectly if you guys want to add like a couple little bees onto it and use yellow buttercream And make like little beehive For the petal cupcake, I'm going to make little dots and kind of bring the icing towards the center So making a dot and kind of pulling my bag and we're going around the cupcake and then doing that on top of that as well It's kind of like the classic petal technique that you can see on some really pretty cakes And lastly, but certainly not least we have spike And then the babies swirls But these two I'm using green buttercream icing and number 22 piping tip Which is really just a small little star tip First spike you want to start onto the cupcake and then push down and release off Pushing down and releasing off your adding pressure to your piping bag and releasing off Creating these little spikes that are going all the way around the cupcake I think this one is really fun and the kids really love it Especially if you add like two little edible eyes and make it into like a monster The baby swirls you just doing that you're making little baby swirls going all the way around the cupcake So let us swirls and let us swirls and little swirls kind of layering on top of each other Now there are so many raised you guys can ice cupcakes So this is just a couple of them for you guys to get a new idea of the few things that you guys can do I will leave all of the links to where you guys can buy any of these piping tips as well as which tip goes with what cupcake All down in the description box will know along with all of my recipes And of course everybody knows the best way to eat a cupcake is to pull off the bottom a little bit over on top and to make like a little cupcake sandwich Hmm I have guys really enjoyed this video today if you did I'd love for you to give it a thumbs up and you guys can check some more videos out over here If you're not subscribed to my channel you guys can click this floating head that's over here And you can subscribe because I put out new videos every single week Thank you guys so much for watching.
