 Hello John Lard here and today I'm going to talk about weeds and the thing about weeds people it's one of these parts of gardening that a lot of television gardeners and gardeners and book they sort of skim over as if they did not there's something they're sort of like this family secret that should be kept secret that no one should know about but weeds if you allow weeds to control your garden you will spend all your time weeding and very little time gardening so you should you should be root to split weeds because they will take over if you're not careful you have to be root and you have to know your weeds and this is a perennial I just I just happened to see this weed here today and see it in there at green now this is the spanned flower heads of anaster small little aster and the weed is called Voikia Crackett is Vetch and it's a climb it climbs it has little tendrils and it's closely related to the peat it's a type of pea really a Vetch and it has a seed quite a big seed but half the size of the pea so it's got a lot of energy and if the seed happens to fall beside the plant it has a lot of it has a lot of resources to get to get established and be able to pump heat with the plant and once it gets established it starts to run at the root it runs underground then it comes back up again and then it runs again and if that was left believe it or not if that was left that was the ignored in ten years time it will be here it will be grown through the hedge it will be through the grass it will be in there and it would have seeded all over the place it would start coming up over here and up over there so we're going to knock it on the head because I've been cut with this plant before I've had to take board as a part to remove this plant before so we're going to get it dirty we're going to have a look how to do it now we're going to use a fork it always is a fork because a spade splits a spade breaks up the roots the long roots and you want to try and keep the roots of the weed intact it's much as possum now two forks you have the little small border fork and you have the normal digging fork and we'll we'll keep quite a border fork we have a look see what we're doing now this is going to be tricky and we have to follow this is very tricky and obviously can't use weed killer maybe we use the bigger fork can't use weed killer because you killed a plant so this is old fashioned now we have to take the plant up now you can see the problem if this was lacking out a hand this was going to get out how would you control it it has to be got now looking here a few grobes nothing in here got some little grobes in another you see them but we we leave them alone not doing me any harm so we won't do them any harm now when we see can we get the base this is actually almost impossible to get out so much caught in with the roots so what we're going to do is we're not even going to bother we find get it out but we're not going to bother even putting this back we're going to take a piece from here and put it in there we're not we're not even going to bother that's a serious of this see how can't even find it it's in here somewhere and all we're finding is these grobes as I say nothing plants any harm we won't do them any harm and the bike here there it is there but I think it's so caught so caught up with the plant that we can't get it out with the pitty because it has a very long very quite root and it's very very distinctive but what we do instead the little gap here and weed is all gone we just check get down a bit deeper to see if there are any weed roots no looking there but we just maybe dig a little piece up here that's it and that's now an elevator weiser and that will go into the compost heap because we don't want this weed to go anywhere else but that's that was a stitch in time saves nine
