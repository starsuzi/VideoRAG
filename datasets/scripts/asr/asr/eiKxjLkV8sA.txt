 Yo-yos. No, sad. Let's talk about that. Good Mythical Morning! As I'm sure you already know, it is National Yo-yo Day. And you may say, I don't care. I don't care about yo-yos. Yo-yos are stupid and yo-yos are for dorks. Well, yo-yos are still cool. I don't care what you say. I mean, have you seen Zack Garmley? I mean, that kid is like a machine, a yo-yo machinist. And now we are not that good, but we are still pretty amazing at yo-yo. So, I know this probably comes to news to you, or it comes to news about you. Or it comes as no surprise, because we got yo-yo arms. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Go out and they come in. They go out and they come in. Just like a yo-yo. Is that what you meant? You meant that they can toss a yo-yo and retrieve it. It's spin-leaf. Here's the thing. There was a brief strata of time when we were in grade school. I remember this. I think it was after baseball cards went the way of the uncoolness. And yo-yos became popular at Bowie's Creek Elementary School. Yeah. And that made us really popular. No, that made us get into yo-yos. I think we were just, it was just in you. Do you remember now? No. Everybody brought yo-yos to school. I would trade yo-yos. My favorite yo-yo was a glow in the dark, Duncan Imperial, which now they don't even sell. Oh. And I'm like, hope you still got it. I was looking. I was looking to buy a new one, and it didn't happen. But we have some of these. Let's do some yo-yo and for old time's sake. Let's show them what we got. We're going to demonstrate some yo-yo prowess. And just make sure that your mouth just doesn't say gaped open too long, because you might not be able to shut it. The first thing you want to do is see a little bit loose. Okay. So, I'm going to demonstrate, you know, the classic one for people who don't have pets, walk the dog. The yo-yo is the dog. That's a fancy yo-yo you got there, right? It's like a pet. You see that? I can walk that thing all the way to the dog park, and then let it defecate. And then, of course, I would clean up after it. All right. What you got, Link? First of all, I have a light up yo-yo. Oh, that's classy. Yeah, that's the way I can see it in the dark. If I'm like walking down the street and the dark, and people are like, is that a yo-yo? No, it's a pedestrian with a yo-yo. I'm not going to hit that guy. That's the first thing. And that's not a trick. The trick is, of course, you have the forward toss, because anybody can do that. Anybody. But then, you got to think, around the world. Wow! Wow! Around the world! And what about, she's second. And what about for people that don't have children? Now you do another round of world. To it, don't round the world twice. Whoa! Oh! You should have put what you're in. Oh, man. And what about for people who don't have children, but still want a baby? Well, they can rock that baby. Rock that baby on that long. Okay. And then it goes right. See that? I mean, I really get back into this. Really? Just, whoa. I got a little stuck. Okay, there we go. All right. What else you got? Link. Now, first of all, I'm going to give you another, double around the world here. Oh, did it! Boom! Boom! I'm switching it up. I'm switching it up. You're switching it up. Water. What? Yo, yo, how about this? I got to go with my Arlin and G. Go right here. Slip knot. I'm like the heavy metal band. I like some slip knot underneath this. All right. So this is what I like to call the shoot the moon. I didn't name it. Someone else did. It's like, bam. There's the moon. Oh, nice! Yeah. How you want me to do that one? This is not wasn't seventh grade. We were going to get it very excited when we did it. There's the moon. Whoa! Nope. Rubber recovery. You try shoot the moon. Shoot the moon? Oh, yeah. Try one. It's like a sunching. You got to pop it up, too. I was going to do a shoot the moon. I can't do shoot the moon. I did the babies in the dogs. What about the one where it comes back on itself? Let's check this one out. What's it called? Man on the flying trapeze. Oh, this is a difficult one. Oh, I'm going to get it. Okay. What? There you go. Oh! That wasn't good. Yeah, we know. That was all. That was man on the flying trapeze. The man on the flying trapeze went around the world. Okay. So, as you can see, we're a little limited in what we're capable of doing. But that doesn't mean we can't invent some new tricks. So now it's time for... Oh, new yoga tricks! 24D! Sometimes when you walk in your dog, you're like, well, that's my dog got to be on the leash. Well, I can't my dog be free like he was before he was domesticated. And that's what I'm about to do right now. My new trick called Unleashed the Dog. There goes your dog. Oh, doggy hit a wall! Is your doggy okay? He's under here. He wanted to get away. Hey, doggy. He's still good. He's still good. He's still good, see? Hey, press your friends. All right, next trick. My trick's called the hip-yo-tist. It's a version of therapy involving a yo-yo. Check it out. First, you sleep your yo-yo, and you bring it up and you say, oh, you're getting very sleepy. When I say the word zesty, you're gonna act like a chicken. And then when I say the word, been a dick, then you're gonna snap out of it. Been a dick. You're gonna do your trick? Oh, yeah, I don't have one. I just... I blew it, man. Why don't you just go? Really? Yeah, as yo-yo dead, I just want you to go. No, I just want you to go. Okay. You have another trick? I do, I got another one. Everybody likes yo-yo, dirt. But, why do you gotta use a spoon when you gotta yo-yo? What are you calling this? Dibbaruski. Yo, get it, everybody. Let me get a little yo-go down the yo-go down the yo-go. Let's get up. Get up. Oh, that's good. Keyline. Can I try that? Get a little bit of Dibbaruski. What? A little spin. Yeah, look at that. That little spin. That little accident on my pants. That's what happened sometimes. Okay, this is called the slow-mo yo-yo. Now, the thing is, I'm doing this in real time. But it's gonna look like slow motion. That's the tricky part, okay? Now, like I said, I know this appears to be happening in slow motion. But really, I'm doing it in real time. That's the trick. It's just very slow. 2014. Yeah! Next trick. Okay, for this one, you need two people and two yo-yos. It's called Yo-yo Fusion. Here it is. Very challenging, all right? One, two, three. Oh! A brand new yo-yo! Yo-yo Fusion 2014! Look at that! It was two hard yo-yos. Now it's a red yo-yo! I don't know how it happened, but that was some zesty stuff, man. Hippi-yotus. Buh, buh, buh, buh. Buh, buh, buh, you're chicken. You're chicken, just try and try. Get your whole list. Oh, chicken. Benedict. Yo-yo Fusion! We did it, man! Thanks for liking the comment on this episode. You know what time it is. Hi, I'm Lester. And I'm Lizzie. We're from Somerset, England. And it's time to spin the Wheel of Mythicality. We've got an all-new ear biscuit for you to listen to with your ears. Our good friend, Joe Barretta, is the guest. So listen to that. Also, we're pleased to announce we're going to have Saturday videos on this channel now. Saturday morning cartoons! The Wheel of Mythicality animated outros from IndieMals have moved to our channel every Saturday starting tomorrow. Who knows, maybe this one will be animated. Link confesses his undying love for Link. Right? Yeah. You know, there's something about playing with Yo-yos and being in his environment, kind of going back to a younger age that's really made me feel very vulnerable. I feel really vulnerable. You want to confess something? Well, exactly. I feel like I could confess something that otherwise I would never say. And that's... All right? Okay. It's better be good. I am in love with me. I love myself. You know, if anyone... I guess that's important, though. If anyone else wants to love me too, they can. Well? But I do love myself and I'm fine with that. We can make some phone calls. Find somebody. I feel so much better now that that's out there. I love me. I believe that there are a few things in life that you should be careful how good you get at them. In no particular order, you're going.
