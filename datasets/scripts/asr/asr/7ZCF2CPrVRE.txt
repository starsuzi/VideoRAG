 Hey everybody, I decided I needed a vacation so I'm taking this week off But I've left you with a project and this is a project that I started two weeks ago and well two weeks ago being today By the time you see this today will have been two weeks ago And I'm gonna finish it up two weeks from now on the day that I post this video So future Steve will finish it up. So I'm not sure what it's all gonna look like But I do know what it's gonna look like today, which is yeah two weeks ago in the past You can see why I need a vacation I I could drop in these three eighths inch bolts that cut out some pieces of cardboard that I hope will kind of absorb some of the moisture from these All right, I can just sandwich this all together I've got some fairly large wingnuts to tighten down should give me plenty of grip So I guess I'm just gonna see how tight I can get this So I'll set that aside for two weeks and take it apart and see what it looks like then I hope there's a big reveal moment where I go I could finally use this picture frame and made a few weeks ago I've cut a scrap piece of plywood and I'm just gonna paint on a simple background And And I'll see you when I get back. Boom! And just like that, I'm back. Did you miss me? Well, now, you know, the neat thing about this now is that today, you know what today is? Today is today. And I feel well-rested back from the vacation. And you know, the only thing I thought about the whole time was this flower press. Well, let's take a look at it. Let's see if we have the big reveal moment. Oh, yeah, that's not bad.
