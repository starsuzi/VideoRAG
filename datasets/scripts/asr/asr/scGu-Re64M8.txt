 Even though slime is all the rage right now, Nickelodeon has been sliming things up since the 1980s. I'm Laurie from TTPM, but now kids can make their own version of the network's iconic goo with Nickelodeon slime, neon, and glow kit from Crazy Art. The slime in this kit is made from white glue and a special slime making powder, plus it comes with neon and glow in the dark colorants. All you need to add is water. Fill the instructions to stir the glue, water, and colorant together in one bowl, and hot water with the slime making powder in another bowl. Then mix the two concoctions together. Once it cools down, you'll have a slimy material to play and experiment with. The instructions even include a few experiments to get you started. Kids are gaga over gooey slime these days with videos on how to make your own slime all over YouTube, but with this kit you get everything you need in one box for making multiple batches of the stretchy, squishy, and slimy slime. The instructions are easy to follow, and kids will have a lot of fun creating their slime and then playing and experimenting with it. It's for ages 6 and up with adult supervision.
