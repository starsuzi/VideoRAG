 Hi, I'm Cindy from BDownSwear.com and today's video I'm going to show you how to take some tool and make a bustle It's a great little sophisticated look and it's easy to do. So what you want to do is pick out what color you want to use Get your base piece This if you put it on a pillow or something so it stretches out so you can kind of see where it's going to go We're just going in the center of the short So for today I picked a short and I picked some ivory tool I cut a long piece and then now I'm going to fold it in half Don't worry about if the edge is a little messy. I'm going to lay it down and I want a second layer Of tool also I picked a little bit heavier of a netting for here. I'm going to lay it down and I'm basically just going to take it and gather it Gather it up Just keep going in and out in and out in and out Now I'm going to take a needle Think about tool you got to remember the needle the The end is going to want to pull through so don't let it go all the way through without feeding it back through Behind the knot and then just weave in and out I'm using the gold thread, but obviously you'll want to use a thread that'll blend in I'm going to tie it off And then cut the end I Won't want to attach it like this so first thing I'm going to want to do though is clean up the end make it even So where the sewn piece is I want to go even all the way across So you don't end up With it looking funky while it's on Sometimes you'll get some little stray ones just trim them away And then you're going to want to place it into the center I remember you can go little in the back or you can go even wider in a pen it Just watch how it gathers up when you go back in and sew it down And I'll straighten it out And then this is where you'll go in and you'll decide what length you want and it's really simple You can just trim up the edge Easier if you lay it flat and do it, but it's just simple to trim it up And if you see any little spots that point it down just make sure and clean them up And then you'll do the same with the second layer Now you can keep it closer to the body or with tool if you separate the pieces and Fluff them up It'll give it a poofy or look Remember then you can even take a rhinestone piece and place it across the back You can do some pearls some chains All kinds of fun stuff just take a look at it see what you have and then add to it Make it look really interesting Thank you for watching our video if you enjoyed it make sure and subscribe because we're going to have some great videos coming out On hacking dance costumes Don't forget to check out our website be dancewear.com All of our pieces are made here in the US There are over 200 colors you'll find all the basics you need to make an amazing dance costume And if you have any questions or ideas for future videos please leave it in the comments below We'd love to hear from you and remember be inspired be original be dancewear.com
