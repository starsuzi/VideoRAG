 My name is Debbie. I'm a registered nurse in the state of Oregon. So this video is how to use the Instant Cold Pack. For any time you have inflammation from a spraying or a burn or an insect bite. So what you do first is you squeeze it so you fill the inner bag pop and then you shake it or rub it and then you can put a piece of cloth between you and the pack, apply the pack and if you want you can wrap it with a bandage and keep it in place for 15 to 20 minutes. This video is one in a series of how to use your first aid kit brought to you by America's disaster relief. I encourage you to read the included manual in your first aid kit. You can also watch these videos of how to use the items in your kit. Alert 911 if it is a life threatening or major injury or illness. Otherwise you can use the items in your kit while you're waiting for personnel or to treat minor injuries. A good first aid kit such as the one brought to you by his America's disaster relief can be helpful in reducing pain and injury from common accidents as well as potentially saving a life. I highly encourage you to have one at home in your car and at work. Please click on the link below to find out more about this first aid kit. Remember a first aid kit is not a substitute for getting qualified emergency or medical care when you need it.
