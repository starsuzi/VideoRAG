 Hi, it's Kaya from Pantry Prattice here. Real honey should crystallize. That's how you have know that you have a real product. Sometimes speakers call this set honey. Well, this particular jar of honey is from a farmer's market. It's as hard as it can be. So if you want it back in its liquid form, all you have to do is use your ex-calibrate hydrator. So what I'm going to do is I took out all the trays of my dehydrator except for one and I was just using this for hot peppers earlier today. So I stopped and cleaned my trays from that. One tray in here and that's because I really want air flow under the jar as well. And I'm going to place in its heavy but it's okay. Your tray should be fine in that break. We also sell the stainless steel trays as well. So I'm just going to put this jar in the center of my dehydrator and here we go. And then you can't see and that's just fine. But what I want to do is set it to 110 degrees which if you have an ex-calibrate is still in the yellow section on the dial. I'm going to decrystallize this honey in about two to three hours and we'll come back and take a look. So I have been gone for maybe three hours. But the thing I think I love the most about my dehydrator is that it's not important so much how long it's not like baking something or if you don't get back at burns. So I've been gone for probably three three and a half hours and if you remember our honey I could turn my jar upside down and it wasn't going anywhere because it had crystal out of its door set. And can you see this honey now is very liquid. And so I certainly can't turn it upside down. I just want to show you that my honey is no longer crystallized. I had it set for 110 to 115 in my dehydrator for about three hours and I again have liquid honey that I can use for baking or for other purposes.
