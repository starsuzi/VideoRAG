 Hi, this is Mariette, welcome to my kitchen. Today I'm going to prepare a very popular Mediterranean salad called taboulet. For this dish we need four bunch of Italian parsley finely chopped. Two firm large tomatoes finely diced, half a bunch of fresh mint finely diced, one bunch of green onion finely diced, two lemon juice or lime juice, most will work out well. Three tablespoon of fine borrower soaked in four tablespoon water, salt and red pepper, extra virgin olive oil, and two virgin cucumber finely diced, one Roman lettuce washed. You can prepare these hours before but you shouldn't mix it unless you are ready to serve. I usually prepare them and put them in the top of the wire, cover them and put them in the fridge when I have guests. In the last moment maybe half an hour earlier I mix them all together. We add the mint on the parsley and tomato mix and then the green onions. For the cucumber, the borrower, some salt to taste and red pepper. I use a lot of red pepper, top it all with the lemon or lime juice and mix it well. And as much oil as you like, this dish takes probably half a cup of olive oil. Easy. You prepare the dish that you are going to serve in. What I do is I take the Roman lettuce and I just put them around the plate that I'm going to serve this way and I press it so that they stay in place. Then I spoon the taboulette on the lettuce. I take the shape of the plate and I put the heart in the middle. You can eat the taboulette with the lettuce like this. You can taste it. You can eat it with pita bread or French bread and you bread that you like. I hope you like taboulette and see you soon.
