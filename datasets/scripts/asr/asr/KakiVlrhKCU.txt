 So what I have for you next is a dessert type of martini, pretty much like an adaptation from Lesson 1 that we learned are cream drinks. This is going to be the chocolate martini. It's real rich, it's decadent and delicious if it's made right. So the ingredients we're going to be using for this is going to be vodka, always going to be using vodka. Takes on the flavor. We're also going to be using chocolate liqueur. So let's go ahead and start making our martini here. Take my glass, peel it down. Up next fill up our cup all the way to the top of ice. We're going to be using an ounce and a half of vodka. Half an ounce of our chocolate liqueur. And go ahead and give this a shake. This is a basic recipe. There are many more different types. Go ahead and pop that off. Go ahead and pour out our ice. And what I'm going to do here before I pour my drink is room this up with some cocoa powder. So we get a nice, sweet and sort of bitter taste to it, which cocoa powder has. Let's go ahead and pour in our drink. There you go. Here is our chocolate martini. And it's basic form. Delicious.
