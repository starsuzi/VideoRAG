 Hi, Jay Kavness with the Asbestos Institute. We get a question pretty commonly here from homeowners, and the question is, if I have popcorn sealing in my home, should I be concerned about asbestos exposure? Well, there's a couple things to think about if you have popcorn installed in your home. First, it's fairly uncommon to have asbestos containing popcorn installed in a home around after 1980, or thereabouts. Now, there's no drop dead date when contractors stopped putting asbestos into homes, but by 1980, it was a fairly uncommon practice. The materials should still be tested if there's a concern, regardless of the data construction. Second, it depends on what condition the popcorn is in. EPA would call it a hazard if the popcorn is what they call friable, meaning that it can be reduced to powder by hand pressure. So, if there is popcorn installed in a home that was built well before 1980, and the popcorn is falling off of the ceiling and creating dust and leaving evidence of dust in the home, yes, it may be a health concern. If the paint is good and the popcorn is in good condition, there's really little concern for health issues. But if you have any more questions regarding popcorn in homes, please contact us at the Asbestos Institute. Thank you.
