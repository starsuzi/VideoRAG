 This is Chris the Idaho Painter. In this video we're going to give you five tips to painting a bathroom So it looks just like a professional painter did it so stay tuned to this video So I'm here in this small bathroom right here and painting a bathroom doesn't have to be this really long gone out process Where it takes a day or multiple days to do a bathroom like this can easily be done in just a couple hours But one of the key elements they're painting a bathroom and making it look like a professional painter did it is actually Have tools that a professional painter would have now I'm gonna give you a list of the tools and some of the items that you're gonna need to get this project done So this is tip number one when it comes to painting a bathroom and that's actually having a paintbrush and a paint roller That's actually gonna give you quality results and if you try to save money and go cheap on a paintbrush and a roller You're just not gonna get those straight cut in lines You're not gonna get the quality finish on the walls and it's just gonna take you a lot longer to apply the paint I typically when I'm painting interiors I like using an interior brush That's a three inch angled sash brush. I like a wider brush because I can paint a lot faster with it A good quality brush is gonna give you nice, crisp, fine, clean cut-in lines It's gonna hold a lot more paint and you're gonna be able to go a lot farther So you're gonna paint a lot faster with it the brush that I typically use on interiors when I'm painting interior walls and doing cut-ins I like a pretty brush. It's called a clear cut brush and this is the actual brush I use that brush is really good for doing cut-ins It's really good for doing the layouts on your walls and edges It doesn't leave a whole lot of roping. It's an excellent brush The next thing is is your roller you got to have a good quality roller and when I'm rolling the walls I use a three-eighths inch nap. That's the depth of the roller So use a three-eighths inch nap and I like the white woven rollers from purty Now if you go cheap on a roller the first thing you'll notice you start rolling on the walls It leaves a length on the walls which just doesn't look good the length that's actually the The stuff the fuzzy stuff on the rollers so cheap rollers leave the length on cheap rollers I have a tendency to splatter so you're gonna get a lot more mess on your floors use a high-quality roller and You're not gonna get a lot less splatters are almost none the rollers we use I use a pretty white-dub white woven Roller and that roller is excellent. It doesn't it hardly ever leaves any amount of splatters and it also holds more paint And lays the paint out a lot better and it doesn't leave very much stippling a cheap roller or cheap nap It's gonna stick with your walls really bad and you're not gonna get that good quality finish So the tip number one is by a good quality paintbrush and a good quality roller So when you're there at the paint store getting your roller and paintbrush a few of the other items You're gonna need you're gonna be rolling your walls So in a small bathroom like this I just use a 9 inch roller So you're gonna need a 9 inch roller three eight inch nap and get a roller frame to go with it And if you go cheap on a roller frame the cheap ones have a tendency to Flax when you're rolling the walls which will lead trailing edges on your walls or what we call lat marks So buy a good quality roller these tools though all of them will last you a lifetime The brush is gonna last you a lifetime the rollers and if you clean up your naps properly I got a good video on how to clean Roller nap and a brush out on my channel via your whole painting go check it out But they should last you forever so don't try to save a couple dollars on them get the quality stuff So buy a nice heavy-duty 9 inch roller you're gonna have to have a metal pan I like just putting those cheap liners in them which were like 50 cents that way when you're done You could just throw the liner when you don't have to worry about cleaning out your pan So you got your roller your pan want to get a drop cloth to put down on your floors If you got some old sheets around the house those things will work But really a good quality drop cloth if you do spill any paint it is it's gonna absorb the paint a lot better than just a sheet Will so now you got the tools to actually roll the walls you got a roller a roller frame You got your pan got a drop cloth. I like to have an extension pole So I don't have to climb up and down ladder so buy yourself an extension pole and to me that the little the two to four Five extension poles are the most versatile versatile extension poles you can buy So get yourself an extension pole then you're gonna need the items to do your cut-ins and I typically have a two gallon Cut-in bucket which is just a flat bucket It has a one gallon grid inside of it and then I got my paint brush And I do a video that shows you how to do cut-ins like a professional painter gives you I probably got like six or seven cut-in videos Teaching you how to do really straight cut-ins and it shows you the exact tools I use in that video if you want to see the exact tools I use so tip number two I got all my tools gathered together Tip number one was buying a good quality paintbrush good quality roller tip number two is buying a high quality tape And the best tape that I've ever found for doing my cut-ins in around edges around door jams around my baseboards All my trim the best tape I found is frog tape You want to get a tape that the paint's not going to bleed through to give you edges where the paint's bleeding throughout your trim Frog tape is the very best I've used every tape out there on the market There's nothing better than frog tape But I also use clear coffee in along my my frog tape Which it will actually give you just laser straight lines on all your trim around your door jams your baseboards window trim Around stuff like your your showers and bathtabs and stuff like that So tip number two is get yourself frog tape I like I don't use anything but just one inch frog tape I do get a lot of questions too about how to go about using the frog tape and clear cocking I do have a video that explains that and that too It's a really good video on how to use cocking and frog tape to make laser straight lines on a wall Like if you're painting a stripe or something like that So you can check that out later too, but we're gonna move on to tip number three now So once you're all already to paint you've gathered all your supplies the first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna Come in here and just put a drop cloth down to keep anything from paint from spill on your floor You're gonna unload open up your paint can load up your paint roller stuff get ready to paint and then You begin running your one inch masking your frog tape around all your baseboards door jams window trim Sinks all that stuff that's actually gonna have your cut ends you're gonna run your one inch tape around there as a Extra measure. We actually just run nine inch paper with a hand mask around all the edges to To just help protect from splatter to your drop cloth if you tuck it up against everything That will help but your sinks and stuff like that We just run paper from our hand mask and we're just using one inch tape nine inch paper on that hand mask But you're gonna get all your tape run around all your edges and then you're gonna start the painting process So tip number three is actually getting into the managing of This project and actually getting it done in two hours and tip number three is once you get all your masking done You want to get a first coat on these walls So this first coat will begin drying and that first coat you don't want it to be heavy like you're trying to cover it in one coat Typically when we're painting and rolling into your walls We always figure on putting two coats and our first coat is what we call a skim coat So we're gonna put on roll on here a light coat on there enough to just get a nice good thin coat on the walls And then that will dry in about 30 minutes So tip number four is part of the next process We've rolled our first coat on the walls. That's tip number three. Get that first coat on there a skim coat Get that stuff on there nice and thin so dry fast turn on your fan That will suck out some of the extra moisture in your bathroom that the paint is actually creating because the humidity is actually gonna slow down the dry time Crank up the timber turn your house get it up to about 75 degrees That will help it dry fast But tip number four is actually doing your ceiling cut ends Now I'm gonna go around and do my ceiling cut ends and I'm gonna do them and try to do my ceiling cut ends Still they will cover in one coat So I'm gonna put them on there pretty heavy on a cut end and then I'm gonna back roll it with my with my roller my four-inch roller That's in my pocket get those all done It's a small bathroom I can do the cut ends in here and about 15 minutes And then I'm gonna move on to the next process Now I'm gonna move on to tip number five. This is the last tip and this is doing your cut ends and rolling your final coat So you've done your ceiling cut ends now and now we get it want to move down to doing your cut ends along all your trim Wherever your one-inch tape is you're gonna cut all that in and then roll your your second coat over the top Were those overlapping those edges so you're keeping a wet edge You're gonna roll all that and then you're gonna pull off your masking So I'm gonna run around put my clear cocking on all my tape Then I'm gonna cut my cut ends in with my paint and then I'm gonna go back and roll the walls and fill in the walls Now this process can be a little bit confusing I get a lot of questions on it and a lot of people are wondering You know about whether the the paint or the cocking is gonna dry and peel off when you pull the tape off If you can't move fast enough and do this whole bathroom do all the cut ends and roll the walls before Where do you did your original cut ends are if that dries before you get to it and roll the walls and pull the tape What's gonna happen is the paint's gonna bridge from the wall to the tape and it will peel off So sometimes you know if you got larger rooms larger bathrooms You might have to just roll or work two walls at a time you'll run your clear cocking Do your cut in roll your two walls your second coat and then pull the tape off and then move to your next two walls But this is a small bathroom So the process is gonna be I'm gonna run my clear cocking all around all my edges that only take about five minutes or less Then I'm gonna do my cut ends with my my brush and my roller around all these edges Which will probably take me about 10 minutes to do the cut ends 10 15 minutes And then I'm gonna begin doing rolling my second coat on my walls and the second coat is gonna happen really fast And here there's got a lot of walls You'll probably take another 10 minutes and then I'm gonna just pull off all my tape You want to make sure you pull off that tape before the paint or the copying dries So then once you've rolled the final coat on the walls You're gonna immediately go back pull all that tape off When then let your walls dry that all your cut ends dry Then you'll just go back typically on your cut ends because you're trying to do this one coat You might have some light spots. I just go back do all those those touch-ups on my cut ends Usually the walls there's gonna be you know nothing more you'll have to do the walls Because you got two coats on the walls in your projects.
