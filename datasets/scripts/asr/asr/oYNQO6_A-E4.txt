 Hi, I'm Sunday with Natural Sunday and I'm going to tell you how to make a natural insect repellent. And these days it's really important because there are a lot of very harmful chemicals in insect repellents. Now, your natural insect repellent can come in two different types. You can either use a water-based product or make an oil-based product. And of course, the water-based product you can use a little less. Break hand here, fill it with purified water and essential oils. And the essential oils that are best at keeping those insects away are tea tree, lavender, lemon grass, and of course, the ever-popular citronella. Now, either one of these oils or a combination of these oils will work just beautifully. And like I said, you can use it in two ways. You can either fill a four ounce bottle with water. And then I would add probably about a hundred drops of essential oil and shake it up and then spray it on. And they definitely, honestly, they don't last as long as the chemical varieties. But it's worth it to get the natural part of it. I'm more than willing to accept that I have to apply it more in order to get a more natural product and more healthier product for me and my family. Real quick, the second way is to make an oil. And you can do any kind of a carrier oil, grape seed oil, apricot kernel, even sunflower, or great. Take a one ounce bottle of a carrier oil and add from six to twelve drops of any of the combination of the essential oils I mentioned. Lavender, tea tree, lemon grass and citronella are wonderful. Add it and then of course just rub it on your skin. And it's very, very gentle. And again, you might have to apply it a little bit more often. But it's worth a trade off from putting all those nasty petrochemicals under your skin. I definitely would take the lavender root any time in the essential oil route. So keep it natural and I guarantee you that you'll be thankful. I'm Sunday with Natural Sunday. Thanks.
