 Every week on HorseTalk TV we answer a viewer question. This week Bridget writes, My horse is difficult to bridle. She won't open her mouth and she puts her head up in the air. Can you help? Fossing a bit into a horse's mouth without preparation is a common cause of bridling problems. Do not try to push a bit in without getting a horse to open its mouth first. Metal bits on teeth hurt. Do get a dentist to check your horses teeth to make sure there's no physical problems. Make sure you've gathered up your nose, band and strap to make it easier to slip the bridle on. Horses have no teeth between the front incisors and the molars, so it's safe to insert your finger. Tickle the tongue with your thumb or finger and the horse will react by opening its mouth. For a stubborn horse, a finger pushed into the roof of the mouth will get the horse to chew. Once the mouth is open, lift the bridle up with one hand and pop the bit in with the other. Gently pull the horse's ears forward under the brow band. When unbridling, hold the top of the bridle and let the horse gently spit the bit out to avoid an nasty bang on the teeth. Following these steps will make for problem-free bridling. Thank you for your question and for your great effort you've won these prizes. From Sharp Lebaratres, a 900 gram tin of divedallact.
