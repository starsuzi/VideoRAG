 Hello and thank you for looking at my video. So I thought I'd be able to show yourself how I was able to find more time within my day. So what I have done is I wrote down on a pen and paper. I thought this was quite important for me to actually be able to look up what it is that I do in a day or and actually in the whole week itself. So firstly we get 168 hours okay. So what I did is I took off the time for the sleeping and then I also took off the time that I spend during my working hours as well because obviously I've got a full-time job and that's quite full-on and a lot of times I get quite tired but what I was doing before was I'd come in cook some tea and then I would maybe watch some TV programs and actually if didn't actually give me anything from watching these apart from just some pure downtime and what I was actually doing is on these TV shows I found that they weren't actually giving me anything at all. In fact some of the times I just thought like what a little rubbish that I'm actually watching. So with the actual TV shows these shows that I was watching before they approximately less about 30 minutes and they're on I think it's four maybe five nights a week because I don't know I haven't done it for a little while and what I would do is it was literally my habit of doing that and I found that actually thus like two two and a half hours per week on watching rubbish and then not only that the next actual program would come on and I'd watch that as well and then someone coming the room and going oh what you're watching I've got done I always just on and I think really I was spending my life just wasting it so it's amazing how these little programs can just add up so what I've done is like say firstly I would say write down the hours okay let's say go through and then look at the hours that you actually have left then look at where you're spending this time okay is it that you spend on a weekly basis you spend three hours chatting to someone which is a quite a long time but really is that necessary is it really that important that you watch these soaps or is it just a habit if you're looking to actually go to know what I want to start going maybe into the gym or I want to start doing a class or I want to do some more revision just kind of go well do you know what where am I actually putting my time at the moment now I have written a blog post all about this it's on my website and I'll put the link in the description in the little box underneath so it is www.blit www.inspiredbyt.com so if you want to check that out that's great there is an actual blog that I've written up on this so like I say all I've done is literally just looked at where I was putting my time that's it um and then what I've done is eliminate the things that actually gave me no fulfillment and they were just bad habits like I say I was watching some soaps sorry my house really like fluffy and um it's because I'm straightened it so it's kind of like gone so so uh and again more time I kind of saved a little bit of time there um not straightening my hair um so like I say just literally go through what your actual week involves or maybe it's every two weeks that you do something in particular um so and that's the way that I actually was able to to find the extra time to be able to do my social networking making videos um doing blog posts um and and actually now I even find time to be able to cook um many many good foods all from fresh which is something that I never used to do um so which means that we're eating much healthier than than ever before um and I really do enjoy um putting all the different foods together and before it meant coming in putting some dinner on um and then just literally it was the old habit of just click watch TV and like I say gave me nothing maybe you know do a few posts and now I'm able to be much more focused so um like I say I actually think some people have had a food diary um to help them to see what foods they're eating because they're looking to control their weight and I would suggest doing the same but with your time time management so um hopefully that this video in you know might help you to be able to sort of look out what you're actually doing um sorry like I say keep going everywhere um so hopefully this video will be able to help um and for you to be able to focus um and be able to find some time um to really invest in yourself because I think that's so important and if you hear people say I haven't got time for this I haven't got time for that they have generally speaking oh don't get me wrong you're gonna get the odd um few people that you know what some serious stuff's happened in their lives and they are completely using every single minute every single day um and that's sort of beyond their sort of control but in general I would say if you hear people say oh you know I've got time for this I've got time for that general school shit um if I'm honest um just means that they can't be asked um so um it's up to you whether you want to go around making excuses or whether you're a doer and going to general I actually I'm gonna focus my times my energies because this is what I really do enjoy and I want this to work so I hope this helps and like I say please do have a look at the website that um it's all written up there and hopefully you might gain something from it I do hope you do um if you like this video um please do give it a thumbs up I'd love that and um come back for more thanks and bye
