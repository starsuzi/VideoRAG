 Welcome to the New Wentz in the Kitchen! Today we're making sauteed red cabbage. Let's get it started! For your ingredients all you need is some extra version, olive oil, salt, garlic, carrots. I'm using some basil leaves and your cabbage of course. Here you go, that's my red cabbage. Now with my peeler, I'm going to... Now I'm going to chop the basil. In a frying pan, I'm going to add 1 third cup of oil. Red cabbage. I just lowered the temperature to let it simmer. The carrots. Mix it all in together. Add the basil leaves. 2 pinch of salt. Cover it, on low temperature, don't forget and let it simmer. This is 20 minutes later. All done. All you have to do is plate and serve. Thank you for watching.
