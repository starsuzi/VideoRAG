 Okay, here we are, Kenny. Pulling yourself up on the... Yeah, awesome. I love it. Look at how sweet this is. Honey, I need a tree house, especially one with pulleys like this. Oh! So awesome. I totally have to bring my kid over. The kids are crazy and they pull 20 out of here. Huh? And then they will bring themselves off of it. Oh no! I will not do that. Oh my goodness, that is kind of scary isn't it? And I love how you've woven the fronds of the ponds. That came from my childhood online. Oh really? Really? Wow. So awesome. Very cool. I love it. It's like the Uber tree house. Well, and you know I was driving down the wrong street getting over here. Oh yeah. And there's a kid on the other block that's working on a tree house at his own. Yeah, just been on the roof. Yeah? Two, four, three. There. Oh, your neighbor's backyard, awesome. I love it. Sharing. Very cool. You know people are always wanting to thin their bamboo. Yes. And so let's take a look at these bullies. So sweet. Look at that. So I told you about my children. And so there's a girl, but they can jump out and swing. And the color can't go to the top. Oh nice. Oh that's their physical fitness practice. They touch the top. Oh I see. Oh my gosh. So awesome. I love it. How long did that take to make? It's one of those things like Mike thought about it for two years and made it in a weekend. Oh, there you go. It was probably more than it was probably a couple of weekends. And then you added on as you went. Of course. No? Put it all up. But it was like this years of ruminating. Look at this thing. Oh, see? Well I haven't been designing in my ruminations, but I have been begging. Please, please, can we put up a tree house?
