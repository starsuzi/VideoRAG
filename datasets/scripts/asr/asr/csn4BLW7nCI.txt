 Hello and welcome to another episode of How You Can Do It To. I just want to do a short little video. I'm standing out here in my yard about some wild, I call them green onions, I don't know what they actually call, but actually my brother kind of pointed out to me. I never knew they existed in my yard. They grow wild and they were planted in no seeds or anything, but let me show you what they look like and are quite tasty. But this is what they look like. It's like normal grass just growing in the yard so I got some over here. There's kind of an ant bed. Got a few over there. But this is February here in Florida, but here they are. Let me get my knife out. Get around here. Let's see. See if I can get the bulb. I always just take my knife out and kind of pull up under them. But see, yep, see I got the little bulb on here. And then generally what I do, right here in the yard, I'll soak them in some vinegar, some voleslamic vinegar, but this is what they look like. They're getting they grow wild and just kind of clean it off trying to do this all one handed little hard here. But I just want to show you that and this stuff is kind of interesting. Let me turn the camera around here again. Hold on just one second. But yeah, this is it right here. Actually, I cut up the little green part too. Put them in salad. But really tasty. But hey, look around your yard. You never know you might have sent yourself excited. No for years. But again, just wanted to do this sort of little video and have a good day. Thank you.
