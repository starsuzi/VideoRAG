 Okay, we make it open. What was that? The shelf is tilting down. Why is everything breaking? We make it fried okra today y'all. Nice and crunchy. It's got that beautiful corn dough pressed on it. Fried okra, fried okra. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we got some fresh fried okra here today. I like to use the frozen or the fresh doesn't really matter. These are really good in season in the springtime or the summertime. Look at that. Beautiful. We just kind of trim the tips up with a knife just to make it nice and smooth and pretty because it's sometimes tough and brown and ugly. So what we're going to do is we're going to soak the okra in some buttermilk. I've got some buttermilk here. Just pour it into our shallow dish. So what I've got inside of here is just some self rising flour. For every reason you don't have any, you can do this with all-purpose flour and some baking powder. I'm going to do like a cup of flour to one tablespoon of baking powder. That kind of a ratio. So I'm going to actually add some cornmeal in that because I like that crunch from the cornmeal that you get. My daddy used to make this. He didn't add cornmeal but I kind of like the extra crispy cornmeal flavor. So we're going to do some cayenne pepper. Little bit of heat action. So attach to that. We're going to add some smoked paprika. This is a Spanish smoked paprika. Try saying that five times. You can use any kind of paprika you want. You can use a smoked, a Hungarian, it's a little bit spicier. You can do it every one. And some garlic powder. Easy, easy, easy. We're going to use our whisk here. A little tiny whisk. And we must season. Less speed for cat. And we'll salt at the end too once it comes out of our oil. All right. So really this is as easy as it gets. We're going to take it from the raw stage. I'll do like five. Give it a shake. Give it a shake. And with your hand, just grab them. Give it a little bit of shake. Roll it in that flour. And cornmeal. Crest. Yum. I'm going to fry these bad boys until they're nice and golden brown. All right. Drop it. Like it's hot because it is hot. Drop it. Cool. I'm going to keep working on this. So I'm going to add these okras to our flaming hot poppin oil. So a couple of times you don't want to crowd the pan because I'll bring down the temperature of your oil. Just move them around. Let them get nice and crunchy and crisp. This takes about three minutes. Literally until it starts turning golden brown, it's cooked. It doesn't take a whole long time. Whip them out. Do. Do. Do. I hope they're done. It's going to pull them out. That oil. Stack them on tat. Nice golden crisp. Yes. All right. Cool. Let's add our heat off, give it a nice season of salt. All around, that looks good. Yes. Woo! I gotta give this a taste. Oh, got flip. Oh yeah. Banging, banging, banging, good. That's so good. No way, it's not overly slimy. It's not like that slimy taste that you get. You eat ogre, it's nice and crunchy and firm. And it looks so pretty. I'm gonna put it up on Snapchat right now. Look at that. Oh yeah.
