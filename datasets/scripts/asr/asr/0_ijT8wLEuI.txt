 Everyone knows slime is awesome, but today we're taking it to the next level and customizing our very own versions. We've got two slimes here. We've got real next slime and then we've got a batch of homemade slime too. We also got add-ins, we've got eyes, all kinds of crazy stuff, and we're going to combine them all, just mush them up. Yeah, let's get to it. Oh, yeah, give this a try. Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah. Oh, I'm into this. Look at that deliciousness. It's gonna get messy. Get in there. I get your hands in there.

This is pretty legendary, I gotta say. But I think mine looks better. I'm gonna take a picture of this for myself. Do it. That's how we customise it. I'm gonna put it on the bottom. That's how we customise our slime. How will you make yours? The only thing better would be sliming somebody with it. Maybe you can't. Oh, no, no, no, no. I'll get it over there.
