 Music Alright my man Ryan is about to go on a downgrade year coming up. We're going down shifted. What? We're going down and we're going down and going up. You ain't going nowhere right now. You will be going down. If you look at that ahead, there's that Lincoln monument. We stopped that the other day. Oh that's right. Remember we went up the mountain. Alright so he's about to go down and show you guys how to do it. You know safe. Safe these number one. Alright. So we're going down shift to eighth gear. We're going to shout down shift to eighth gear before we start the downgrade. You see guys? There's Mr. Lincoln. Alright my man so get ready to start down shift. You see that sign on the left if you're looking ahead. Alright. So you want to start down shift and right now reduce speed sign ahead. You see? Yep. Down shift. You want to slow down? You see what that speed limit sign is? You see what this other sign on the right is? What does the sign on the right say? Alright slow it down. You got this car on your right. Yeah. Alright let's slow it down one more. So is this car pass as you? Actually let this car get over to my car. Alright start watching our PMs. I need you to dodge before it drops. Alright slow it down my man. Slow it down. Slow it down. We did down shift Ronnie. Slow it down. Take that signal off. You're going to get points on the test if you get that signal. Alright now shift. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down my man. I need you to go to eighth. Come on Ronnie. You trying to go to sixth or eighth my man? Alright I need you to down shift my man. I need you to down shift. Why is she like this? Look how you grabbing the stick my man. Come on. Eight. Get in there. Oh for sure. Ronnie we need to be in the gear bro. Like slow it down. We need to be in the gear like ASAP. Slow it down Ronnie. Slow it down. Slow it down. Engine break. Engine break. Slow it down. Give it a little step. Watch your RPMs. You should have been down shift the man. Yeah what happened. He was going in the sixth. Alright slow it down. Down shift. I mean no down shift. Give it a little step. Alright just keep that RPMs at 14. Put your four ways on. You need to watch that man. You can't be going down no mountain. Cruising and thinking you're going to. Well you were grabbing it the wrong way. Just watch the RPMs. Give it a soft and firm tap. Alright if you got a chance if it's not too much to ask I need you to watch your mirrors. Alright. Oh yeah. Everybody's in the line. 14. Bring it up down. Yeah. Some whole little tap. When you get up to 14. And then your RPMs. Give it a little tap. Bring it back down. Yeah bring it back down. You good. You see him. You got your four ways on. Alright man. You need to look. Don't wait for me to tell you. Show me you got it man. Just the way you was grabbing the stick man. You should have been. I don't know why. I don't know either but. Just going to let you know that the examiner grabs the stick on the test. Well you're going to slide the big fail on the forehead. Oh man I got this. What's your RPMs man. I shouldn't have to tell you Rodney. That is something you should be doing man. Just going to let you know that. Yeah. Yeah. Listen man. Get ready to step. Alright I need you to watch a trailer man. I mean your mirrors because these guys holding butt up past us. You need to watch them. Make sure they're staying in their lane. We got four ways on. Anytime you go around. Slow speed. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Why do I have to tell you to watch RPMs man. Huh? It's like. Bro. There's no excuse for that Rodney. I told you every time so far. What's in my mirrors? I'm staying on the play with my hands. 5% grade? Alright. It's good. Good test man. I don't even know this. It's the first time I've taken my motorcycle. You've taken others. You just don't realize it. Remember you want the RPMs to get up to 14 and bring it back down. Yeah. Soft and firm. Stab. You know what I mean? We're doing good speed. Soft and firm alright? Not soft and soft. Yeah. Just like that. Make sure that you see that the speed goes down. Yeah. They got at least go down to 5 miles an hour or 5 miles I mean. Alright. That's good. Remember you want to be on the lower gears before the down gear. You know earlier I don't know what happened. I mean I know what happened. You wasn't grabbing that stick right? You wasn't putting the knife. You was trying to put it in 6. Because if you're the grind, it's a real sharp grind. That means you were totally missing the gear. Going to the wrong gear. Alright. You see it's going. Yeah. Let off the engine brake. It's going slower than you need to. Let off the engine brake. Let it get some speed. I mean there's nothing wrong with going slow but you want to go too slow. You know. Alright. So this is the RPMs. Get up and hit the engine brake again. Because if the truck is being held back with just the engine brake, just hit it. You know. You know. You try to avoid pressing a service brake or the brake. You know. You want to hit them up. You know. But if the engine brake is doing the job, just let the engine brake do this thing. If it's going too slow, let off the engine and then let it get speed and then hit the engine brake again. The engine brake will not wear down. I had a student one time telling me that an instructor told him that the engine brake wears down. Go ahead and watch RPMs. Look at nothing else but RPMs. The RPMs are not coming down with the engine brake. I need you to stab them. Alright. Alright. Think about it, man. You have to watch the RPMs and the speed and stuff. Because next face, it's going to be all you, baby. And if your uncle's on here waiting on you, he's going to write you a fat ticket. I'm just letting you know what's going to happen. Alright. You see how we're starting to let off the brake kind of? Yeah. You see he's starting to go straight out. So now you can go ahead and upshift. Alright. Go ahead and get the RPMs back up. You know, give a guess. Don't take the four ways until we get up the speed. Alright. If you look ahead, we're pretty good. That was an expense. Good. Just next time you got a beat? Yeah, you got a shell. But you see when we called it, 8th gear, the RPMs shot up really high? Yeah. Because you would speed this catching up, man. But if you catch it before, you're good, you know what I mean? You can control it. And that's what we want. You always want to have control over the truck. That was good, man. That was good experience because I don't remember. I think that's the first 5%. No, we went defensive aint in all that. I don't remember. It's just, I remember climbing and I remember going up. Or it was more of a stalls. Yeah, you came down, it was just, you know, you handled it different. You know, every mountain is different. Yeah. Summer, steeper than the others. Yeah. But this was good, man. That was good, man. Just remember, guys, you want to downshift prior to the downgrade. And get the engine brake going. Engine brake does not wear it down. All right.
