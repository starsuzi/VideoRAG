 Hey, what's up? It's Vince Leah. There's a lot of non-dairy ice cream alternatives in the stores these days, but what happens when you want fresh, soft, serve ice cream? You can't get that here, but I know just a spot. I'm at yogurt this morning, and we're going to get a behind-the-scenes tour of how they make this soft serve. All of our soft serve is made in-house, starting with the almond milk. That is huge. We're cutting some lemon. We use them in our strawberry serenity and in our tantric tart. Hey! How are you doing? I'm doing good today. I don't know yet what do we have today? We need to use greens one of my favorites. I'm in a better problem. I get everything in the cup. I think I can have one on a go for green tea trinket. You going to rent me up? I'm going to drink some Christmas. The great mountain top with the snow caps and the I want to eat it, but I have to eat the camera eats her. It's okay. My food can go cold. Oh, really cool. Oh my god, it won't come off. Super booted on. I got everything. I got everything. Is it a redeemable one? Just doing her Instagram thing right there. Yeah, question is. There's just so many ways you could do this. It's a texture I'm looking for today. You know what? You just let the wind decide.
