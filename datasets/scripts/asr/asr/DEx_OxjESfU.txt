 Hi, I'm Allie with the Potomac Beat Company and I'm going to show you how to make wine glass charms to hang from your glasses. I've already made a set here and what we're going to be using is ring memory wire and you want to cut the ring memory wire so that when you're looking at it you have about a turn and a quarter. Just enough and not too much that will be easy to get on and off your wine glasses. What you're going to do is take a round nose pliers and you're going to make a little loop on this end. I've already done that here and sometimes it's hard to get it round because the memory wire is very very stiff. On that loop end then what I've done is I've hung a little charm. This happens to be a little pink cocktail glass. Most of the ones that I've done already have little wine bottles on them and then different color beads. What you're going to do is just take a headpin and make a loop at the top so you can link those loops in together. Simply then slide on whatever beads you like right down to the end and then on the opposite side what you're going to do is repeat the same steps that you did at first and you're just going to make a little tiny loop. That way when you have it on it your beads won't fall off and you have your wine glass charms so that way you can take them. They're great party favors to give or holiday gift ideas. Ring, again ring memory wire and just a couple little charms and some cute little beads.
