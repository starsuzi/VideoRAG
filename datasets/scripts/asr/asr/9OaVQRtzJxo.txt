 Hi, today's recipe is apple cinnamon oatmeal in the slow cooker in the crock pot. I'm really excited about this. I've never tried it. I actually don't typically like oatmeal but I started eating overnight oats that I make in the refrigerator. I need them cold in the morning and I really enjoy those so I'm giving the crock pot oatmeal a chance. So I already have everything in my crock pot. It's 10 o'clock at night. That's why I'm talking kind of quietly. And by six o'clock in the morning, these should be ready. I'm going to cook them eight hours on low and I'm really excited to see how they turn out. I used steel cut organic oats, almond breeze, unsweetened almond coconut milk, pure maple syrup, ground cinnamon, pure vanilla extract and two granny smith apples. But you could use any apples that you prefer. I chopped and peeled the apples and put them in two cups of water and added the steel cut oats and then I added the cinnamon and stirred it up and the almond milk and stirred it up and then I put it into the crock pot in a separate dish. This will prevent the oatmeal from sticking to the inside of the crock pot which makes a huge mess and it's really hard to clean. So if you put the dish inside the crock pot, you could then fill up the edges of the crock pot with water up to about an inch below the rim of your baking dish. I cooked these overnight for eight hours on low and then in the morning to how smell delicious like apples and cinnamon and my breakfast was ready. It's perfect to have breakfast ready right when you wake up. Enjoy!
