 Hi everyone and welcome to Cooking with Cricket. Today I'm going to cook some salmon patties out on the black stone grill It won't take long at all, but I just thought I'd bring you along Now salmon patties was my husband's one of his favorite things They has mom and his grandmother used to make when he was growing up I never would make it or eat it again There's kind of a story you could even just go up to my sister and say do you want a salmon patty? And she's probably making the same look that I'm making now I'm not gonna go into that story, but that will be why I'm not gonna try it so anyway, I have one can of pink salmon I've drained off the liquid and and when his grandmother would come and spend some time with us I Would ask her did she mind cooking it for Ricky because I wouldn't even cook it or attempt to cook it So anyway, I'm going to take as much of the skin off and take the bones out as I can Okay, I got most of that picked out And I'm just gonna kind of mash it all up Now this is the way that she taught me to cook it Richard's grandmother So I'm always do it the way that she taught me because that's How the men in my house like it and now the seasoning it just a little bit of salt I use kosher salt and some black pepper I'm gonna sprinkle in just a little bit of garlic powder fit in just about a handful of some dried parsley flat not a handful Paddy teaspoon of dried parsley flakes And I have a little bit of onion that I meant stop and then one egg I'm gonna mix all of that up Now I'm gonna put just a couple of spoonfuls of flour And go baby And give that a mix and then see if we can form it in the patties Hang on baby if it gets too dry you can always add a little bit of the reserved liquid Okay, that looks good to me So let me get my hands washed and I'll bring you back Okay, you can make your patties any size So I'm just gonna I have my pan lined with some fold and I've sprayed it with some nonstick cooking spray just so I can Transpare to eat just so I can transport it easily out to the griddle Just gonna put a little bit of my hand and just form it into a patty Hang on baby And then I will meet you outside at my griddle Okay on my salmon patties on this side of the griddle it's As low as it can go because on this side of the griddle I'm cooking fried cabbage and that video will be linked At the end of this one so I am Gonna put down a little oil and when I do then Ricky's gonna take the spatula and kind of smooth it out a little bit So I'm just gonna put my patty on All right, I'll bring you back when it's time to turn it Okay, I'm gonna turn my grill up just a little bit About a medium high And I'll bring you back when it's time to turn it Now the one reason why I'm cooking these salmon patties out on the griddle is because I was already cooking something else So I just brought it out here too with this big griddle. It's easy to kind of cook your whole meal out here So anyway, and even if you have the smaller one or the tabletop version, it would be perfect too. Okay, it's time to turn them Perfect I Wish that one down flat help me Okay, it won't take this side long at all to cook and I will meet you inside with the finished product Hey, Alex and Ricky are gonna try the salmon patties. I will not Taste like salmon patties. Oh good You like them they're good Alrighty then there you go And if I was frying them inside I would do the same thing So anyway, thanks for watching if you like this video, please give me a thumbs up comment because I love hand-fremmy How do you do your salmon patties? Please let me know and until my next video. I hope you enjoy. Bye. Yo
