 I had a favorite white shirt for about a year. I wore with all my suits and it quickly became a staple of my wardrobe. But over time I realized that my white shirt was looking more grayish blue than white. More dingy than sophisticated. And you know, I just wasn't clean cut. Then I discovered how to make my whites even wider than white. Here's how. One of the biggest keys to remember is to wash your whites on a regular basis, especially when it comes to perspiration stains. You'd want to eliminate those as soon as possible and prevent them from ever setting in. If you wash them often and use a stain treatment on the underarms, or anywhere else where yellowing might occur, then you will be leaps and bounds ahead of the dreaded yellow armpit stain. Okay, I'm good for right now. Another tactic to use when preventing yellowing is to add half a cup of baking soda, a time-tested whitening agent to a regular wash load to give it your bleach a boost. Now, with this method, you want to reduce the amount of bleach you have by half. One of the other time-proven methods is to use cascade or any other disdetergent in your laundry. Even dingy sweatshocks come out white when you soak them in a solution of half-cup lemon juice, or two tablespoons of automatic dishwasher detergent in a gallon of super hot water. Soak for 30 minutes or overnight if they are very dirty. There are multiple effective ways of whitening your whites and preserving the brightness of your whites. Whites in essential color in any wardrobe, whether that be a casual or professional one. And you need to make sure you're looking that sharp as you possibly can.
