 There you go. Little update on my tree. My bottle of tree. I went ahead and painted it up. Now it's brown like a tree. But as you can see, they're green. All the limbs are green. Brown and green. So now it looks like a tree. Brown and green. Put a few more dials on it. Now you're getting some bottles to put on it. And see what it looks like. Y'all hanged out. Y'all. There's my bottle tree. This is from the road. The view there at the road. I think I like it pretty cool. It's kind of in the shade right now. Let me get a piss bank. See if that's any better. Ah, there you go. Munch of my bottles and stuff I had. My aunt. Give it to me. And I. I just had them in old bottles. I actually did. And I thought, well, I'll get them things out. Put them all here. I don't think it looks pretty neat. And Carolina Creasy right. And then big old wine bottles. They look a lot better. Better because they're better, you know. But I don't have them all. I got these little little beddies once. They might look like hearts. I've actually got the lid to this one. That's an old time and liquor bottle. It's got like a square end on it. It goes on there. It's pretty neat. It plugs right in the end there. I guess if I had a ball or I could like you care about it. I could fill it up with some good old liquor, moon chimes or something. Well, yeah, I find I'm thinking about building some, uh, or just buying some M downtown. I'm a little, a little plastic, uh, flyer boxes. Put them in right there. Put some flyers on it. I think I'd look pretty good, wouldn't it? You know, once flyers right there. Here's my little apple trees. Here's my poor old fig tree. Every year I think it's about give up the ghost. I get right up there. It's got green on. Right there. You think that it did? It's about three years old, bloopers, not. I don't know. I'm going to have to give it some, give it some more love. Garden does good, but me and fig trees, we're not doing so good. Here's my little apple tree. Right next to my whole shoe pit. I can see it real good either. It's in the shade. Anyways. Take my whole shoe pits. Here's one. Well, I'll pick seed or not, but I'll say. Here's one. Another one right up there. 40 foot. Pulled a pull. I put some sand. I dug up out there in the woods. You know. There's my whole picnic table. I do a lot of my melcoals. Stuff like that. But anyway, y'all. There she is. In the glory. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Well, that sun hits up this right. It's going to be pretty. The scams can't see me too. Just wanted to make a bottle tree. I don't know. I had some old lumber sitting around. I thought, well, I'll just nail that stuff together. I think I ended up buying six of them. A little dowel. They're about four foot long and they're about a half inch round diameter. There's a $1.60 something plus a check tax at the lows. It worked out pretty good. Y'all give me a like if you like it. Come back, say me. Here's the camera's going to say me too. I appreciate it. Hey, and if y'all will go to my library on the left side of the page. And you can click on the. I have video sections like some from my cookin', some from my. You know, like my Dutch heaven stuff, barbecue, metal attack, and arrowheads. I got mail call videos. They're all in like groups. And this is going to be in my group for all my projects and stuff I've done over the years. So, well, over the last year. Anyway, this is Cal's Corner, say me too. I appreciate y'all coming back and say me and like, subscribe, comment. And I'll catch y'all on the flip-flop.
