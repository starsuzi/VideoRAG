 Hi guys, this is Kunaal and today I will show you how to perfectly set curd. To get curd, we have to boil the milk after that we have to cool it down. To get the right temperature of the milk, we have a very simple way. Our hand's surface is very sensitive. We have to add 1 or 2 drops of milk to the milk. If it's cold, it means we have to heat it up a little bit. If it's not hot enough, it means we have to cool it down a little. That's it. The milk is our lukewarm. Now we have to add it in a bowl. In 1 liter milk, we have 1 large spoon of curd. We will mix it well. The simple logic is that the curd we have added in the milk will be more fermented and curd. We have to keep in mind some things like the curd is not going to get burnt again and again. The second thing is that the temperature should always warm. It means that you can cover it in a hot or hot pot in a hot pot. And last but not the least, the curd you have to be strong. So, we will keep it aside periodically. Now, we need to cover this and keep it in a warm place. Like I said, if it's winter, you can wrap it in a bowl. And after a few hours, the curd will be ready. We will cut the curd. It's a good curd. It's a nice creamy, wobbly curd. If your curd is very thin and not thick, then it has some bubbles. This means that the milk was very thick. And if the curd is not thick, it means you had curd in a very cold temperature. So, be very careful. The curd is very simple. Follow these steps and you will never fall down. All the best.
