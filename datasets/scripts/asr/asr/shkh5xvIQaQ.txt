 Hello you too! In this video I'm going to show you how to clean any car tires with Coca-Cola, just Coca-Cola and see if it's worth it. This is the first time I try it and I don't know what the results will be. The only things you're going to need for this is you're going to need a bar of Coca-Cola, some type of brush and water to rinse the tires. Okay, so let's go! I'm going to pour in one liter which is half a bottle. Now let's see. I want to say that I'm going to clean the tires, some of them in the springs because I will not soak up they would never have worked in a same feeling. The tires have dried up. I should also mention that I used a towel to dry up the tires. That could have taken away some of the dirt and grime. From 1 to 10, how would I rate Coca-Cola? Well, I would give it a 6 or a 7. Just because the tires are clean, they're not dirty. But I also should mention that there are better products to clean your tires with. Okay, and this was how to clean your tires with Coca-Cola.
