 Now what we'll do then when the cup is full simply give it a little twist it comes straight off or just simply tip it out. So afterwards give it a little wash and we can pop it back up ready to go for next time. Now if you're worried about this being plastic and I'll show you it just how strong this piece of plastic really is. I'm about 82 kilos give it a step as no bending no problems and you can see that's more than strong enough to last you say 10 20 maybe 50 years okay if you want to clean the filter completely there's three simple steps grab a Phillips head screwdriver and there's two screws that are the back here give it a little twist give this side a little twist and that just pops out. So what we have to do is grab these screws at the back give it a little tug see how that is pop off and this filter itself actually comes in three parts so we've got the oil bowl which collects all the oil we've got the mesh filter which separates the oil in your in your fumes and we've got the oil guides which guides all the oil into the oil cup so all of these parts a dishwasher safe so you can chuck it in dishwasher or you can simply just wash it by hand. So when you come to put it back together notice there's two little grooves at the top here these two little grooves mark the front of the filter all do is slide the front in first into these little slots at the front and for the back just simply push it up hit a little click and that will hold it into place grab your screwdriver push the screws back up give it a little twist until you hear it click this side of the little twist until you hear it click and grab your oil bowl with the oil bowl just line up the grooves in here onto the filter itself once it clicks in just give it a little twist and there you have it and that's how easy it is to replace the filter on a row band rangewood.
