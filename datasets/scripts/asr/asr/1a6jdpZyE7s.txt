 Hi everyone, it's Robin and welcome back to Happy At Home. I'm so glad you stopped by today Because I'm going to be sharing with you how I fake the look of expensive slip covers for my living room sofas I'm living with my F2 sofas both of which I bought secondhand for a grand total of fifty dollars Which is a total steal because both of them are in great condition. They're super comfortable They're long enough for me to stretch out on and watch the Netflix or read a book The only problem is that the fabric on them does not match the style that I have going on into my house It's they're both very busy floral prints That just doesn't work with the style that I've got going on So the ultimate goal is for me to sew a slip cover for both sofas, but One of the sofas I've already had for two years and still haven't taken the time just sew a slip cover for the other one I just bought this summer this spring had it for maybe two or three months at the most and Life is busy and I want to work on other projects other than Making a slip cover because it's a very for me anyways Sewing a slip cover is very time consuming in the meantime I fake the look of a slip cover and it is super easy to do and very inexpensive if you've seen any of my decorating in the past You will know that I use a lot of white in my household and then I just add pops of color for whenever season I'm in so when I'm at the thrift store I'm always on the lookout for sheets quilts matlady coverlets blankets that are in the color white and those are the items that I use to slip cover myself as Typically when I'm shopping I look for either items that are in the twin size or a double size Because I find that the twin size you can use two items one for the bottom part and one for the top part to make a slip cover or a double size quilt blanket coverlet whatever We'll go from the floor Up over the cushions and to the back quite nicely was not a whole lot of both So those are the two sizes that I look for when I am looking for something to use as a slip cover So now let me go ahead and show you how I actually use these items to slip cover my sofa Starting with the arm of the sofa I first straped a white sheet over the side of the arm letting the edges skin the floor And allowing a couple inches on the backside to wrap around the corner Next I smooth the fabric up and over the arm and down the inside edge to the top of the cushion tucking the fabric in slightly then adding three to four inches from the edge of the cushion I use some scissors to trim the fabric to size Moving once again to the back corner of the sofa I wrapped the fabric around the edge and used a couple of pins to secure the fabric to the sofa Unbolt the top and bottom edges I then smooth the fabric up and over the arm tucking the edges down between the cushion and the arm until the fabric lays nice and flat And moving to the front side of the arm I fold the fabric sort of envelope style towards the cushion and tuck the top section in The excess fabric at the bottom can simply be tucked up under the cushion itself The top section should look like this And the bottom should look like this notice how the fabric almost touches the floor in the corner Once the cushion fabric is positioned and folded down it will cover the tucked in areas and should look like this To cover the main part of the sofa start by laying the fabric over the cushions and draping it down towards the floor Work with it until the fabric just skins the floor and then smooth the fabric over the cushions until it's nice and flat Next I'm one end of the sofa I wrapped the excess fabric down and around the end of the cushion Making adjustments until the fabric lays nice and flat I'll then repeat the same process on the opposite side of the sofa She covered the back of the sofa I removed one cushion at a time and tucked the fabric down a couple inches at the backside of the bottom cushion I then straightened the excess fabric and out nice and flat over the bottom cushion and replaced the back cushion on top of the fabric I'll then repeat the same process with the other remaining cushions Next I'll flip the fabric up and over the back of the cushions tucking in around the backside I'll then make adjustments to the fabric we're needed to make sure that everything lays nice and flat Then finally on the ends of the top cushions I'll tuck the fabric in around the curve of the outside cushions for a finishing look I then like to add some throw pillows for some pops of color and that's it I'm done All right so that is how I inexpensively slip cover myself as as you saw it's quick it's easy and if you shop sales or the thrift store for your supplies it can be very cost effective All right so that is it for me today.
