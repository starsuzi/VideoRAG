 So to then I'm going to teach you how to make your very own home made hamster treat. So first of all you will need any help of scrap people on your own. But I would suggest you to use the phone because Newspapers ink on it and you will also need some treats. For this case I use some carrots, some pumpkin, some sunflower seeds. So let's get started. So first of all you just have to say like this piece of paper where everything is too big you just tear it up. Okay so I'm done tearing this paper out, tearing this piece of paper into a mix and you will need to make a for any of the treats just small amount. So for this case I took some of the carrots, didn't the carrot, the bright colored one and even the pumpkin. So I'm just trying to put them into the middle. And let's sprinkle them into the middle. In mix you will have to like wrap it up so it should look something like like this. Is your hand is looking like this? Yep so I'm going to show you. I'm going to keep this to my hamsters now. Okay so just cookie. Cookie. Sí›ˆai can see why you eat it. She just involves the homemade treat I always make for her. Oh yeah, and if you think that one year is not enough, you can actually put more liars, this case, um, I think one, two. Anyway, so yeah, thanks for watching.
