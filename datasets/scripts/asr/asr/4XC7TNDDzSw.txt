 Hi, this is Mike Rommel from DevTookStinner.com and this is out of butterfly chicken. Let's start with some basic chicken and an enemy. Here are the wings, the breast, the legs and drumsticks, and this is the backbone. The key piece of equipment, a pair of heavy-duty kitchen shoes. The backbone is what we cut out to butterfly the chicken. The backbone also is the guideline. If you follow right along the backbone, it's easy to cut. Once we're through on one side, spin the chicken around and cut through the other side. If there's going to be a hard part, it's when you hit where the thigh bone meets the backbone. Make sure you cut close to the backbone so you go through the joint. If you get into the thigh bone itself, the cutting becomes very difficult. Like that. There we go. There's our backbone. Now, spread the chicken out a little, then flip it and push down hard with your hand. So you hear that pop that will flatten it out. Talk the wings behind themselves. And there you have it. One butterfly chicken. One butterfly chicken. One butterfly chicken. One butterfly chicken. One butterfly chicken. One butterfly chicken. One butterfly chicken. One butterfly chicken. One butterfly chicken.
