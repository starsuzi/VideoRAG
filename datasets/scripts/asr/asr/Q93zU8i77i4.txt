 This is Chef Tony Morola, the executive chef at Palsam Family Fombs. Tomatoes, tomatoes, grape, vegetable to work with. We work with it as a vegetable, but tomatoes are fruit and they're virtually sweet and really nice to work with. What you want to do is you want to get a nice color on your tomatoes and keep them out in a refrigerator until they come up to a nice tender touch. If you want them to come up a little bit faster you can put them in a brown paper bag with another tomato. Okay so what we're going to do is we're going to take a paring knife and we're just going to run the paring knife around the core to get the core out of the tomato and there we go. So we have the core out of the tomato which is basically unedible and it's a little chewy and that's not something that you want to do. The next thing we want to do is we want to slice this tomato. I recommend a serrated knife, most inexpensive serrated knife basically work great on a tomato. Again once you want to stand it up on its on the side and what you do is we're just going to take a slice right off and then just run your fingers down a little bit so that you take get your slices to our slice evenly enough and what we have is we have a beautiful slice tomato. Thank you so much for watching this video and I hope you enjoyed it.
