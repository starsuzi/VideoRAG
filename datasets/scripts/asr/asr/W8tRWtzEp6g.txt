 I'm finally getting around to completing a video of the spawn cover which is actually also a deck and the key is that I've got this split level patio here that raises up about eight inches that's a quarter inch steel but what this is is a rail that the patio cover rolls on. Look over here you can see that now you have access to the patio with steps down and then I buried this spot about ground level and then the deck just sits right on top of it. The lifting mechanism is controlled by a ratchet that's a reversible ratchet as well as a ratchet pall so you lift this turn that out of the way and then it falls down. It's a pan over to here and you can see the chains are relaxed now. Tighten this. The chains are coming around and tightening up this part. I'll put that down for now. You can see it's lifting the cover and around. Another feature of my patio renovation is the use of these new brick lights and you can see that it's embedded directly into this center block. These brick lights are rated at 30,000 hours of burn time so they'll probably out last year lifetime or at least mine. They have a thin flange on the edge here and the way they're designed to work is that they slip under the ledge of a center block like this and then you have an exposed edge but I didn't want to have that step out edge so what I did was I took the center block and I just looking down at it. I wanted to slice it right here and here and then I cut the center block with a concrete saw here and here and then tilted that plane back so that when I installed the brick light it's flush on the top and there's a recessed face to it. It made it look more like a sconce than just a steplight.
