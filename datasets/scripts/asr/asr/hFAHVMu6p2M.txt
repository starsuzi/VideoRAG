 Hello friends, how are you? And welcome to this week's recipe for Peruvian Salchita Ronas. I actually promised this recipe to be a recipe for you to make this recipe. It's a Sophie thing, the Instagram, and I don't think I forgot. So, to this famous, I made this recipe using Capent Setup, and also a promissive burning. It's just the pot. It looked a little bit, how we say, golden at the bottom. But everyone in my family liked it, so I think it came out all right. Let's go see the recipe. Tattami into medium pieces. Cover with salt. Boil in a large pot with water covering the meat. Add the experiment. Let the water be consumed. Let it fry in the fat that is released from the meat. Serve in a bread bun with fried sweet potato and onion sauce. Thanks for watching this video. I really hope you liked it. Don't forget to visit www.wchallah.com for more on this post.
