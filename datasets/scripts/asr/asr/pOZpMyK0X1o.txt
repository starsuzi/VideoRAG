 Hey, what's up yo? Hey, I was asked to do a video about how I bend this metal when I build these octagon pits and hexagons and all that type of stuff and a guy asked me if I could do a quick video on it right of a high bend it and without using a break and What I do is I score it and then bend it up and it makes it easier and you can get a pretty thick metal like that doing it Probably get up to a quarter inch. You could probably get three eighths of you, but you're gonna have to gap it out pretty wide So in a way, I already got a piece cut right here that I'm doing a barbecue pit for I'll probably do the video on it next and So I'm gonna show you what I'm doing on it I got a piece of steel cut out right there. This 10 gauge eighth inch and I got three of the lines on it already This will make a What was it 23 by 25? Save barbecue pit they got one of the rack and it's about 24 by 22 cooking space in it So I cut this out to do it and Anyway, I got the first three lines drawn on it and what I'm gonna do is use these cutting blades These are 045 cutting blades by the finish you can get and I'll score down that line Some are close to halfway through the plate. I mean you just got a you're not gonna get it exact You just got to get a good little score line on it and then you can start to bend the thing So I have to do more lines on it to keep on going down, but this will get me started right here and with the oxygon when I bend it up I already know that I got a bend each one at 45 degrees So I mean it's pretty easy with the oxygon if you were doing a square You know you'd have to bend it at the whole 90 so I mean when you get into other shapes like a hexagon I think there's 60 degrees if I remember right there's 60 and Some other ones I'd have to I'd have to figure it out, but I know this octagon is 45 degrees So I'm gonna score these lines and show you how I bend it up Okay, you can see I scored them you can't really tell the depth of them Through the camera, you know, but it's around halfway. You just got kind of estimated now if you're doing Like I said, this is a 10 gauge eighth inch and I only need to go 45 degrees if you bend it up And it don't go as far as you want it to go then don't try to force it you need to come in and widen that gap after After it stops bending come back with your cutting blade and run through it again while it's still bent and Not a widened it up and then it'll bend some more if you're going with a thicker plate say 3 16 so quarter eight quarter inch And you know you're looking for at least a 45 degree bend Then go ahead and bend it when you when you score it go ahead and gap it out some they have a water cutting blade the knees to And you can use this one first and then come back through with that water when I don't like the water ones I don't think they're good for much else besides something like that, but It just needs to be a wider gap if you bend and thick a metal because once it butts up It's gonna stop bending. So I'm gonna show you how I go through that process right now All right, first of all you're gonna need something heavy Good solid piece of steel. I use a piece of four inch channel iron right here and What I do is I get this score line right up to the edge of my table and Then I put this piece of channel iron. It's the only reason I keep this channel iron around here The only reason I hadn't you got used for anything else But it up right to the backside of your score line right there Then you're gonna need to clamp that down Make sure it stays there That's giving it something to bend against Then after that you're gonna need another heavy piece of steel And when I use it as four inch three-h flat bar It's another thing that stays around here just for that purpose And then clamp it to the plate as well I Like the back side this would help if it was the same link is what you're doing It would help for that, but I don't cut it down because I use it all kinds of stuff Then once you got something heavy that gives you a Stress point all the way across it instead of just where you have your clamps there or where you're bending it That helps it to have stress all the way across the thing And then you just start bending it up If you have something like this I could push it back against the table if I know it's 45 and put a triangle speed square But I'm gonna get my angle finder just to show how to use it Alright with this angle finder I Know it's not gonna focus in on the numbers But it's mag it's got a magnet on the bottom I can stick it on there and see what we're sitting at and we're sitting right at 45 degrees on there So that'll let me know I can go into the next bend and I'll do the same thing I'll move this stuff up to the next one just pull the sheet down Move it up to the next one and bend that one and just keep going around like that. So let me show you that right quick You All right, so that's three of the beans so far got five more to go and I gotta say you still see it sitting on 45 when you get to the end of whatever you're doing if you're Folding a box if you're folding the arc to gone whatever you may have to tweak it a little bit and I mean that's just part of the game, you know and if you feel like Sometimes you make score a little deep and it feels like it's not wanting to hold it shape right there So when you make your bend and you got the angle you won't run you a couple of tags on it and that's gonna hold it in that position Until you get ready, you know until you get finished bending it up and you can come back and Well that out if you want to on the inside, you know if you feel it's necessary I don't always feel it's necessary so I don't necessarily weld them out all the time And you can see it gives you a good crisp bend on it Because you're already Put that score line on it. I don't think you could get it that crisp if you use heat, you know And if you try to use a torch to heat it man it would take forever to heat that thing and keep it hot and Trying to chase that red spot So that's what I like to do. I'm gonna finish bending that thing up It's almost dark out here now, so I'm gonna give me some lights hooked up out here finish bending this thing and I need to go on to get this thing down. I got a lot of stuff to get done But so anyway, I hope this helps somebody a guy asked me how I was doing it and That's about the best. I think I can explain it, you know You put your score that line you put your good heavy piece of metal clamp it down right there That's given you a a being point and then when you put something on the backside That's giving you a stress point If you scored it deep enough you might not even need that on the backside it might just bend right up But oh Once you get your shape come back put your cup of tax inside there If like I say if you want to weld it out if you don't think it's necessary to weld out then don't you know But anyway, I hope that helps somebody I'm gonna go and get some lights hooked up before it gets all the way dark and bend this thing out If you like these type of videos, please like and subscribe come back for the next one Which will probably be this barbecue pit that I'm doing right now Let's see how deep
