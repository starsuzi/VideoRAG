 Hi, my name is Christina with Christina Amador Beauty and today we're on location at Solonday to Mane in Copag, New York. Today I'm here to show you how you can do a cute and simple look for a teenage girl. So the first step we're going to do is we're going to apply a little bit of lip gloss and a nice soft pink color. Okay, blah. And then we're going to add a little bit of blush. But not too much. You don't want to overdo it. So you want to start at the apples of your cheeks and then work it up. And always do a little at a time because it's easier to add them to take away. Next we're going to add some shadow with an eyeshadow stick. So we're going to apply this to the lid and then use your index finger to smudge. And then we're going to finish off her look with some mascara. Okay, so my shoulder. Perfect. And that is how you can do a cute and simple look for a teenage girl.
