 We can determine the pH of soil more exactly when we use an indicator such as an universal indicator. Then to pour some water into this test tube and shake the soil with a water. This is to let the salts dissolve in the water because you know we can only test pH if we have a solution. Because in acidic soil we will be because of an excess of hydrogen ions and an alkaline soil because of an excess of hydroxyl ions. We have got two types of soil and we are going to see if the pH is different or not. That makes and there we have got our water. I am going to pour off the water with a sedicant and then we are going to test. There we have got it. Right. Now let's see. We have got our universal paper indicator and we can drop it in there and give it some time to settle. We are going to do the experiment with some solutions just now. Right. Okay. The solution. You see any color changes yet? Okay. Let's put in the universal indicator solution. We will give it a little shake. Leave it down to settle. Now remember the fact that we don't see any spectacular results is also a result. What can we deduce from this color change? Can you see something happening there at the bottom? Okay. It's wet at all. It's got a good mix. Give it some time. And there we can see the color change and if you compare this color with the strip and if you compare this color with the original color of the indicator solution we can see that a change occurred. And if we look at this strip the color seems to indicate that the pH is more or less 3 which means that it is an acidic soil. Now if we decant this one there you can see the greenish color and that will indicate and if we dilute it a better idea that perfect. We'll give a very definite indication compared to the strip of a pH of between 5 and 6 in other words just under neutral, garden soil.
