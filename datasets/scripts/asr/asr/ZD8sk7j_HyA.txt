 And then we will see<|en|> Hi, welcome back to Doys Kitchen. Today we are making a turkey cupcake and today my friend Ali is here to help us. Hi, okay so the things you will need? The things you will need is a face. None of the butters. You don't have to know. You need these or you need the eyeballs. You can have any kind of muffin. It doesn't have to be chocolate. But some sort of cake or muffin. Yeah or donut or something that's chocolate. And you need twizzlers. Okay and you need candy corn. Oh and icing. Well if you make it stronger then it will stick more. But the eyeball is going to be stick. You can put icing on the back of it and then you stick it to the nutter butter. The nutter butter is going to be the bottom of the turkey. And you stick it on a cupcake. Yeah and then you need little feathers on the bow. You need this. You need a spatula or an eye for whatever you want to use. Just go here and talk to your spouse. You know anything, right? Well icing is just use it. I think it's just use as a glue. So you can have any glue. It's not glue. We're not going to eat glue. So this is what it's going to look like. You can use little licorice. You just cut them and then they look like little bearded. It will be your set that you can have on the side of the turkey. You just cut them and you put a little icing on the back of it so it can stick better. And you're going to put it just right there. Close the eye. And this is what it looks like. Okay. And then you use the utera little piece of the candy corn. You tear it. So you tear the top of the point part. And then it's easier so you don't have to cut it so hard. And you put it like where normalness would go. Normal. And this is what you have so far. Is what you have so far? And this is what it should look like. But ours is not that similar. It could sometimes be messy and it's okay. It's messy. Okay. So the next part is you take the turkey body or the nutter butter and you stick it in the cupcake. And the cupcake is going to be basically the ground for the turkey. So it's going to look like this. This is my weird chicken. And then you take more of the candy corn. And you stick them in. And you stick them in where the pointy side is inside the cupcake. So it looks like little feathers. And you add the pointy part so it can stick down there and it can break through the nutter. Mine is a normal one and hers is the chief. Mine is blowing chief. See you later friends. I'm Say hello to my big fans in Chicago. Mason. Bye. Bye. Let's keep high five. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
