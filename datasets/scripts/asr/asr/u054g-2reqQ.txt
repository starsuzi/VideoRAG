 Hey guys, Mays here 78 here. Welcome to our first tutorial video on 78 gaming. Yes, sorry, this is getting my new screen recording software soon enough, but for now I'm using this. So today I'm going to be showing you a tutorial on how to get hot, hot, hot, hot, hot to get hoppers to go upwards, which is a common thing that everybody wants to do because hoppers just don't do that. So here it is, here's my solution. So the solution is pretty neat. So what happens is that anything that this in here gets put into this dropper, which drops it upwards into this hopper, putting it into this hopper, which means that for tests are there. There's some butter. So this is pretty neat system. I mean, to build it, it's really not even all that complicated. Just like that. It's a little bit hard to get this right to get that right now you want to put a block here. Put that there, put that there, and you are done. Almost, I'm stupid. So like that, I like that. You can use, you can really use any kind of posing system you want, but I prefer this one because it's my favorite. Oh my gosh, I'm an idiot. So here you go. So it's neat, organized, and super compact. There it is. So with this, you can build something of this sort. And this just basically an enlarging version of that. So it goes here, here, here, here. And eventually into this chest. So that is that very, very compact. None of that stupid water systems, guys, are safe from that water system. So thank you all for watching the 70 came in. My name is Mrs. 78. And I'll see you guys next time. Bye.
