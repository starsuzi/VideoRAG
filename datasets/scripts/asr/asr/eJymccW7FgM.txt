 Hey guys, today I'm going to show you how you can reuse old candle jars in less than five minutes. Stay tuned You're going to need a candle jar, obviously. I don't know what happened to this sticker But I just cleaned it off anyway. It's okay if there's still wax inside because we are going to clean it up Make sure your water is really hot because this is actually going to help break down the wax and it'll be a lot easier Just scoop out afterwards. Please try not to burn yourself because I burned my fingers a few times and it really hurt Also if you wanted to keep your sticker on make sure you're not getting it wet because it will come off Unless you want it off then by all means get the whole jar away Now with a spoon you're going to scoop out all the soft wax just keep scooping until it's all gone Yeah, no more wax now you're probably thinking a lot this is still so dirty How are you gonna get that off? Well my friends watch me drop this first I was so scared I thought it broke Anyways, you're going to get a spider and a little bit of dish soap and you're going to clean the edges again Try to avoid the sticker because it will come off After that you're going to want to get a paper towel and just wipe down the entire jar And yeah, you're basically done Woo so pretty so basically and now you can just throw whatever you want in there pens pencils Bobby pins the list goes on anyways, thanks guys for watching and I'll see you in my next video. Bye
