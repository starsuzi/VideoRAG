 Your roof is your primary protection from the elements. When it's not maintained, you're in store for more than an unsightly roof. Dust and dirt build up over time, giving life to fungi and algae, which form a visible layer of lycan. Left to grow unchecked, lycan gets into cement and clay piles, reducing their lifespan and allowing moisture to penetrate through the roof. This leads to leaks and wood rot, and the extra weight from the moisture can cause the roof to bow, a costly problem to fix. Pressure cleaning is the simple and cost effective way to rejuvenate your roof. Done regularly, it stops your roof falling into disrepair and could potentially save you thousands of dollars. Before problems arise, call pressure cleaning perth now to maintain curb appeal, save money, and keep your clay and cement tile roof functioning the way it should.
