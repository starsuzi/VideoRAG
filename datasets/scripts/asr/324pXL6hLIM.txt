 Hi there, I'm Chef Eric Crowley, owner of the culinary classroom in West Los Angeles. And today I'm going to show you how to julienne an onion. A julienne is basically a matstick shaped piece. For other vegetables like carrots and potatoes, it's literally going to have a rectangular shape. But with an onion, it will have the curve that is natural with the onion. But we still call it a julienne. I wind up taking the onion and peel it, cut it in half right through the root, use my chef's knife, and unlike other cuts where I actually keep the root intact for the julienne, I'm going to cut the root off. And I can save this to throw into a stock pot, for example. Then I turn the onion 90 degrees and you can see where the stem used to be and where the root used to be. We have all these lines. That's where you want to make your slices parallel with these, as opposed to making them crosswise. I'm going to take my knife, middle ring and pinky finger around the handle, thumb and forefinger around the blade. Knife is going to lift off the cutting board and I'm going to start to make some parallel cuts. Holding my onion with my fingertips curled underneath, forward and down. And the more narrow or the thinner I make my slices, the finer the julienne is. And without the root there, the layers start to fall apart. And this is what we call a julienne. That is how you julienne an onion. You'll actually see at the very first couple of slices, you could actually run your knife over it a little bit. And that is how you julienne an onion.
