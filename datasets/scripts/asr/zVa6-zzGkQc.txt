 Hello, I'm IVX Tuike and today I'm going to be explaining two of the slightly more complex features that came in the Late-stop date for Minecraft Xbox and soon be Minecraft PlayStation and that is Crouch Placing and the Hopper so they kind of go hand in hand together so I Big Dead explain them together and just quickly before we start video is it doesn't black one I could see look lovely in this lighting. Let's get straight into it shall we with a Crouch Placing? So Crouch Placing is a really cool solution for a problem that not many people have that was but that was kind of Unsolvable before and that problem was if you have say a furnace you know sat down here perfectly normal thing right furnace with You know nothing in it and if you want to place box onto that furnace like you know either an awkward slap or whether it be like a chest or something When you try to do it it will open up the furnace so an awkward snap just conduct try and place a torch on the furnace Can't do it because open up the furnace and it's kind of a big problem because the only way to fix it is you'd have to like place Blocks around it then place the blocks next to those blocks and it was a really big hassle It was a lot better and I figured you know that the hop like the crouch-placing is a really cool solutions that because what it basically fixes is it means that when You crouching now when you place on top stuff it doesn't open it it puts the thing there So I can have a hopper going into a furnace I can have like free crafting tables on top each other if I want to I can do anything I want to like that and in fact I can have a crafting table a little a little crafting table man right here It's T-shaped crafting table man So you can do this sort of stuff if you really want to and it's cool like that place some torches on there and you get the point So crouch-placing really cool way to put blocks on other blocks if it normally won't let you and I think you know It doesn't come in that useful that often But it will save you a lot of time and it does facilitate more ideas like you can't make crafting table man unless you really believe in yourself That's why you need crouch-placing just to make crafting table man So to move on to the hoppers because as I said they're very closely linked Crouch-placing is so useful for hoppers and they really wouldn't be very possible about it Like they would have been possible but insanely difficult to use so hoppers in a nutshell or an item that take Whatever it's oh, let's uh am I in adventure mode? I must be So hoppers in an upshelter an item that take whatever block you throw into them and So for instance if we throw an awkward stab here like on top of this they'll actually end up inside the hopper They also take blocks from underneath them They take a few blocks from up places and that's their most basic function and you might be thinking Oh, why do I need to put blocks in something else that doesn't really achieve anything Because that's just the tip of the ice because basically if you you know if you connect up multiple hoppers Or you connect up poppers to other things so for instance you can see here. I've got the hopper in the furnace Oh, like I can actually do if I want to is I can have Like a few blocks of coal in it up. It's just gonna go straight in there and it end up right inside It should end up right inside the fuel slot if there's some ingredients in there So now if I want to I can have my furnace automatically refueled by putting these in there Which is a cool way to do things and in addition that you can take this a step further You can have a for instance, you know a chest So yeah, let's say we have a chest then we have a hopper connecting that chest to another chest So this will allow me to transfer stuff from one chest to another so this could be it like as many hoppers as I want it to be So it could be all the way from Skylimit down here and I can transfer items So that's same all the way up there. I've got some arrows and bones I can transfer them all the way down into this chest down here And that's a pretty cool thing you can do like you can have as many of these in the row as you like in addition to just You know chest a chest or you know hopper to something else You can actually go from chest to like a furnace or a dispenser. So just quickly show you for instance here's His chest to a dispenser if you want to you know refill the dispenser whenever it gets empty you throw in You spawn ex apparently you throw them in your dispenser and there they are just ready to be used in addition You could do something quite cool like let's say you have Let's see how a chest here you have that hooked up to a hopper then that this hopper is hooked up to a furnace is Output which is then hooked up to this hopper which is then hooked up to a chest So what you could do here if you fuel the furnace with the real pork drop straight away is if you put the Co-blocks in there it will take the fuel and the you know pork drop automatically from here once they're in there it will put them in the hopper Put them in the fuel base and as soon as anything smells It's automatically taken into this hopper and then put in this chest So if as long as you keep this chest fueled this will give you a continuing source of food So as you can see that's just automating the smelting process You can all make pretty much any farm using this and hoppers are just incredibly cool feature because there's no limit to the imagination You can use you could be like okay what I want what I want is I want to have a chest here for instance And then I want to have a hopper and then a hopper and then a hopper and then this is very imaginative But you have like as many hoppers as you want it For instance if that's what you want just over here and then you know for instance over here You have a little house what you can actually do because awkward snaps like as you can see They'll actually still go through the block end up going right through the chain of hoppers You could have like a full on house over here So let's just pretend we've got a house and you can't see anything else and you're like This is the magical part of the house where you just drop ingredients and they go missing so you're like Okay, so let's throw some way a minute where did my blocks go and if you want to you can confuse people by making your stuff Go away or if you want you can just have like a drop of point that puts stuff in chest So if you don't manually go to the chest if it's too far away You could just be like okay, I'm gonna drop up my slime balls Don't want them. They'll end up in the chest over there and as you can see they'll go right through this long long chain of hoppers And end up in this chest over here You'll see the slime balls start to arrive here now and it's incredible like that They're basically pipes and Minecraft but they do so much more than just pipes and I think they're one of the best features that will Brought in with this list updates So hopefully this video helps you and better understand crouch placing, you know, which is quite essential for hoppers as well as hoppers Themselves because these are just a few situations for hoppers But there's still so much potential like you know look at this my chest is finger Four jobs look at this my chest is feeling with the slime balls that I deposited and as I said this is the tip the ice Burk let me know if you like the idea of hoppers or if to you it's just more redstone You don't want to do because I know a lot of people don't do redstone in Minecraft and I'm curious You know if this you this matters to it all basically So let me know with a like on the video if you did like it share the video if you really liked it Subscribe to see more to you 19 stuff and doing so many videos because I want to show you pretty much like every Cool that there is to show not just like oh here is how you's born in the horse on to show you you know cool stuff And hopefully you're enjoying that too, so thank you for watching the video and I'll see you guys in the next one Oh
