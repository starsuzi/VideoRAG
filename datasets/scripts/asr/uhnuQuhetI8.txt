 Hey guys, it's Carolina from The Hamster in New and this video is how to make homemade hamstered toys. So I'm going to be using toilet paper and if you are going to be using toilet paper, it has to be at these three squares long. Sorry, the videos are bit shaky. So you can either use computer paper or you can use tissue paper. Next I'm going to use some of your hamster food or hamster treats. I'm going to be using my hamster food. I'm going to put it in the middle. Make sure it's not a lot because when you're wrapping it up, it will fall and make it harder to wrap it. And you might as well break the paper too. And you could also just combine the treats with the food also. Next you want to put it like wrap it like A and Vogue. Then wrap it up like Q. As you can see, some of it already fell. I'm just going to put it inside and then throw it away. And now put it back as it fell in the core. As you can see, it might be a bit harder to wrap it up like a candy than a computer paper. But I think it's better to use toilet paper and computer paper because it is softer. But if you want to use computer paper, that is totally safe. I mean it's a bit better if your hamster is a hard chewer. But toilet paper is really good also. So that's basically it. Thanks for watching guys. Subscribe, like and request. Yeah.
