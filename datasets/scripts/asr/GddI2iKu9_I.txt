 Hey all, proper Pam here. I'm going to be dehydrating figs today. We forage these yesterday. Look how soft they are. We forage yesterday and found quite a few trees. There's a green fig and there's the purple fig. So I'm going to be washing these. I'm going to cut the little stem off. I'm going to cut the stem off. And then I'm going to just rinse them off in some cool water. I'm going to cut them in half and I'm going to lay them on the dehydrator. It should probably take, I don't know, 12 to 14 hours depending on the thickness of the fig. Okay, so I just have a bowl of water set up and I'm going to put a few figs in just to get the road dust off since these were foraged. And I know they weren't sprayed because they were way out in the forest and the weeds. So I washed them off and I'm just going to cut the tip off. That's it. I'm going to cut them in half. There. That pretty. And I'm going to lay them on the tray. Okay, there they are. Beautiful stuff. So these are the ones that I chose not to use. Some were really icky inside, some have brown on them in the inside. I choose not to use those. And this is why I washed them. This was their water from the ones that I washed. So I'm going to put these in my dehydrator. Just color that. I'm going to put them in my dehydrator for about 12 hours. And then when I reconstitute them, I put a like a strainer over a pot of boiling water, kind of like a double boiler thing, put the dehydrated figs in that and put a lid on. And you can reconstitute them beautifully. They're nice and soft after that. If you want to use them for cakes or whatever you want to make. So look at the colors. And these are all foraged. And I keep a bowl in my car just for emergency forage purposes. So if you have any questions, put it in the comments. Proper Pam out.
