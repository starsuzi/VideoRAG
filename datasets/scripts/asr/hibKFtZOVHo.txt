 Hi there, this is FixedD, I just cut myself shaving and luckily I found myself some some so called blotters which I haven't had a chance to try yet because I don't cut myself that often and let's see how well they work and I only need to get me glasses so I can see what I'm doing, it's a bit of a mess, alright so let me see, let me call out one of these things, there's a number of the blotters in the packet, it's nice and small and compact, clothes is quite nicely, so let's stick that on there, I'll just give that in Suffolk water first okay just wet that blotter and stick it on there it works, wow, it absolutely works, let's just stop leaking, I can thoroughly recommend these, I love it, I've been playing with them a bit more, but it's a huge improvement because all of these things bleed for ages and the book is to stop and it cut myself very often when I'm shaving and that one's quite a nasty slice, that one's quite a nasty slice and it's bleeding profusely, but this stuff really seems to have done the job, obviously good for this also be really useful to ladies for when they cut themselves doing their legs and other bits and what has got this sticky stuff just to wipe off, but it definitely has done the job, hope you like the video, thanks for watching, bye!
