 So what is the name of this drink? This is the Moscow Mule. This is another Moscow Mule. Okay, this is a different version. Yeah, yeah, so... Okay, so... Shot. A couple of ounces of vodka in there. Okay, let's see what this one tastes like. It's ginger beer instead of ginger ale. But ginger beer is not beer. You buy this in the soda pop-up. Apparently the carbonation comes from yeast, but they don't ferment it long, so it's not alcoholic. So you got your vodka in there. We're going to squeeze a little lime juice in there. That's what makes it cleansing. Make three things ice. Cheers. Camergirl likes to drink on the weekends for weekdays. And since that is part of the weekend, what are you going to make today? Camergirl. We're going to do a version of a Moscow Mule. Have you ever had a drink that you were dissatisfied with? Yeah. Have you ever had a second drink that you were dissatisfied with? No. Two ounces of vodka. Well. And five or six ounces of ginger ale. It's like mostly sugar, right? Yeah, it is, mostly sugar. And then you'll both. All right, so you've graded a little bit of fresh ginger in there. I know, you don't like lime. Good luck. Now it's a little more refreshing. Taste it. Even you're going to like it. If you want to taste lime, oh stop. You made my eyes burn just looking in there. You can taste the lime. You can taste the bits of ginger all up in my villa. What's wrong with that? It's like somebody's working on a sealant like they were doing construction. And now you're going to add more lime. This was sugar. I was sugar. Two ounces of vodka. About a six to eight ounces of ginger ale. Yeah. A little bit of green. Ginger. That's really refreshing. It's the... Just need to drink it. This looks like the edge of a pond out behind an apartment complex. Wow. I like the ginger. Which do you like better? Straight ginger ale. It's sort of sweet. It just tastes like sweet soda pop. It's good, but. Yeah, it's just too much. I like this better. Yeah. It might have something to do with the vodka. Okay. There you have it. I'll call Saturdays with CG. Well, this is just the beginning. CG, the amateur bartender. CG, watch her get a drink made. CG, the amateur bartender. CG, watch her get a drink made.
