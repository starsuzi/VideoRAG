 Brian's to make sure we're clear for everybody. We've here butchering, we hear slaughtering. Would you talk with me quickly about the process that gets us from a hog to a piece of bacon ready to cure? Slottering is the killing and eviscerate nor removing of the internal organs. So almost like deer hunters when dressing a deer in the field. Okay. Then you take the portions and you cut them into the sections of meat that you want. That is the butchering process. So you're going to butcher and cure at a different time than you slaughter? Generally speaking you need about a day 24 hours and it depends on the temperature too. If you are butchering in the light fall early winter you need that time period of curing six to eight weeks. Let's just say for it to be entirely done. And so overnight generally if it's outside in a cool place it's going to be good to go.
