 Hi, this is Yolanda Van Vien and in this segment we're going to learn all about how to grow calendula and it's a gorgeous perennial or annual in some areas that is from the Mediterranean. Calendula aficionalis is also known as the common marigold, the pot marigold, or the scotch marigold and they're originally from the Mediterranean. So any of the areas in northern Africa or southern Europe, they are native and they're easy to grow as a garden flower as well and you just start them by seed in the spring and they'll bloom all summer and then fade away in the first freezes and then you just start them in the spring again. So when you start your calendula by seed make sure and plan them out after the first chance that there's going to be no freeze so it should be at least above 40 to 50 degrees at night when you start them. And you start them inside earlier too to get blooms earlier in the season and then just put them outside as soon as it's at least 70 or above and they'll bloom all summer long. So calendula are actually an herb so they're a very very popular plant as an herb they have a lot of medicinal qualities as well but they're an easy garden plant to grow too.
