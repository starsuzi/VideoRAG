 Hi everybody, my name is Victor from Victor's Foods. We do hands-on cooking events and interactive catering events nationwide in Australia. Everyone always wants to be a star. The most important thing about that is learning how to do it safely and also you need an audience. Today we're going to take you and show you how to flambet. In order to do flambet, you need a pan and you need a hot stove to work with. The important thing about this is that there's a lot of dishes you can do. You can do steak, dianne, you can do crepes, sousette. Today we're going to do tequila prawns. The process is pretty simple, but safety is the most important thing. You never want to take the bottle of the alcohol and leave it near the flame. Everything has to be measured. When we flambet, basically the pan is nice and hot. We're going to add a little bit of oil to the pan. Roll that around a little bit. Get lots of heat there until it just sizzles just a little bit when we take some of our hell-uping chili, some of our garlic, and then finally our prawns at the very end. Take a little bit of chili and throw it into the hot oil. It's nice and sizzling, so that's good. Give it a little shake. A little bit of garlic. And get that going. At this point you can add your prawns. The prawns take about maybe about 10 seconds on each side. So you basically just get them going into the pan, turn them over, and you just have to be a little patient while they cook. Now I'll tell you about the flambet to make sure that you're safe. You need to stand at arms length away from the stove with your arms straight. So the next step is picking up the flamb. When you pick up the flamb, you tilt into the flamb and then you flatten out and shake, shake, shake, and wait for the money shot. So let's see how it goes with our tequila. Tequila, back from the flamb, into the pan, and then pick up the flamb. The camera should be going off at this point and you are the star. That's how you flambet.
