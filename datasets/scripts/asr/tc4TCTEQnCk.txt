 Can you smoke mint? Let's find out. Alright, I got some Harnian Suns organic mint, you know peppermint tea. I saw a video on some guy smoking tea, figured I'd try it out. I mean, it's not really tea. It's mint. It's an herb. Moctobum. But let's try it out. I figured it's a leaf. Alright, there's the organic leaf. It's kind of dry compared to tobacco, you know. So maybe I'll just try a little bit because maybe it's dehydrated maybe. Smells really good. It looks like I'm smoking herb in there. Holy mint. Smokes just like a tobacco. Oh, that's good. It tastes just like the way I drink it out. You know tea. You smoke it too hot. You get that little peppermint bite. It's actually really good. It doesn't smell like mint. It smells like you're burning something bad. I think corneal deal has a blend called crooner. It was blended for I want to say being crossbied I believe. And it had a has deer tongue in it. And I don't even know what deer tongue is. It's something kind of herb. I feel like a like a like this is like a piece pipe ceremony. The best way I could describe it is like a really really high quality menthol cigarette. I mean, you even have to like tamp it down just like tobacco. So the smoking mechanics are all the same. I think this would be good in blend in a blend actually like if you were to blend your own and you want it's something just a little bit different. So let me know in the comments below if you tried anything like this other than tobacco. Have you tried the crooner blend? Have you experimented it all? And yeah, thank you guys for watching. Stay tuned for more videos.
