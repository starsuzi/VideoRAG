 So we did win not not weak he's not putting lipstick on. I'm doing the 100 layers of liquid lipstick. We're just lipstick but liquid lipstick stuff dries and it's pretty good. Okay we're gonna get them back in color. I don't like them not being in color order. Okay so we're gonna start this. I'm gonna start this. Basically it's 100 layers of these colors on my lips. So here we go. I'm scared. Oh my god. Oh okay. Yeah it's pretty good. Just totally messed up. That is very good to do. It's really hard. Oh my gosh. I think I'm gonna need back ins well as in a sec. Or I'm not gonna get back ins. Oh I lost count of how many layers this is. This is dirty. It is too much lip gloss. Lipstick stuff. My lips feel really plumpy. It's like really messed up. It's staining my face. This gets harder and harder to hold on as it goes. It feels weird to talk to you. It feels weird. I don't want to smile. Oh no. Because it feels really weird. This is what you're going on. Five. Yeah this is a thick one. I'm gonna fix that. Oh this is so gross. Oh no. I know I can't see. It's hard applying this. It's like I had to date on. It's hard on the bottom lip because it's so dry. I am fine. I am fine. Oh look at that. Nice job. I don't care. I'm here. No I'm going on soon. Right. 14. Oh wow you're. I'll be back. I got to go track her. I'm going to try to get them. We're going to have to write back. Hold up. I look like a blonde. Why my eyebrow looks so pale. Okay. Guys this one is so gross. I feel like I can't. I can't. It feels so disgusting. I need to do my eyebrow too. I'm just riding myself. I'm riding. I'm going to go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey. You all look gross as I am skinny. I can't. You all look gross as I am skinny. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. This is nasty. Ugh. Why not? Oh. I can't eat with this one. Okay. I'm going to go. Okay. I'm going to go. Okay. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. This literally makes me look pale. All this might. Sixteen. If you want to know what you're doing, that's right. What? You should do just for your channel. I probably do like a hundred coats of lipstick. Ew. Oh, gross. Don't let you laugh. Don't let you laugh. It feels weird when you smile. I feel like my lips have like glue on them. Ew. Oh, look at that. So pretty. I am so ready. Ugh. If I were going to date a Alexa, I just could I... Oh, no. I saw that look. Brittany. Don't get me like our cream. Oh, a bit. So cute. Ooh, I'm starting to lose my face. I'm starting to lose my face. Stop making me laugh. Oh, I'm so pretty gross. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm so pretty gross. Good. Somebody tell them to fuck. Besides us. I don't have. Somebody tell them to fuck over here. I'm not. I think you're going to go upstairs if Brittany has some stacks up there now. So it's going to get kind of quiet in here. And you can get quiet in here now. Just, this is kind of fun. It's not... We do it. It's not... Take it. This is what we do on a Monday afternoon. It got in my mouth and it tastes really salty. Oh, no. I don't know. It's starting to get in my way of the things lip. It's like all around. It's not. We ran the things that this, but she went crazy. She just took a lipstick and this went around 100 times. I haven't seen that much. That's what she did, dude. She just did 100 times at one time. Like, he'll heal, he'll heal. Yeah. That sounds like her. Yeah, so we got some fun challenges. So we suggested to do this challenge. And the tattoo challenge, like a 100 layer of tattoo, 100 layer nail polish. But you didn't want to do that because you already have your nails done. So you wanted me to do it and I figured who would want to watch me get my nails done. So I figured with this... Guys, you have to watch me get nails done to sacrifice. I'm kidding. So when she did this challenge, did she use this one color? She used a whole magical color. Who? She just used her lipstick. She didn't even use it like when she just went around with it. Oh, so she went around hard. Yeah! That's what she did. Gross! Great. I don't like that. Wait, that was 20s. No, wait. We didn't do 25. Yeah, we did 24. This will be the 20s one. I'm kind of... I'm kind of confused. How's the feeling? It's in my mouth. Like it's on the inside for like... What's the thing that you still look like? I know that way. This is real. I feel like I'm thinking. Oh, this is really crazy stuff. I don't know how you're surviving. Is it a challenge where it doesn't fall off for something before it hits 100? No. Is it going to make it to 100? Or is it just going to like... I don't know. Did you drop something? Okay, well, we're going to put nail polish on you. We're going to make a nail polish on you. You're not going to be laughing when I do it. I think he's going to punk you on hunting. Huh? Huh? What? I'm standing in the sun. I'm going to hurry back. I feel like I'm like some creepy person. I'm not scared of you because that's how I love right now. I can't hear you speak. Okay. I'm so hungry. I feel like we're doing the nail polish out in a day. That's not very cool really long. This stuff tastes salty. It's gross. So we're going on to... 20th? Call me if this is going to take. I don't know, maybe 31 or more. I want 27. I'm going to eat. Oh, this is gross. Oh, D. You're right. Okay. Okay. Can you see a tongue twister with all this stuff on your lips? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. What kind of color are you wearing? I don't know. Looks like they're a lizard like... I'm going to go on any... Give me a second. I mean, I like putting on mascara and eyeshadow. I don't like it. But not this. I see. Oh, I can't tell. I like lipstick and lip gloss. I'm not this much. Hmm. And then you go on and do it and your lips look like this. You're like, Hey, I'm going... I'm going to this living room. I'm going to shopping. I need to dress up for this... This fashion show. And you should put all this on your mouth. Hmm. You look like you're listening to a fall off. Oh, good hair. Oh, no. It's like... Oh. Okay. You put all this stuff on your lips and then you end up having to go to the doctor and they're like, Oh, it's wrong with you. Your lips are wrong. Oh, my God. I'm just going to go to my room out of this stuff. I'm not much more left, huh? No, not much more. Oh, this is so exciting. I'm going to eat done with this guys. It's fun. It's really gross and hard. Oh, my God. So now we're at 99. I'm trying to see what kind of thing is done. I'm going to get this on. Oh, 99 and counting. Well, yeah, that's it. This is going to be it. So you have 100. What does this look like? I got to see this. A stroke. I can't even focus on it. What in the world? This girl is reaching it. Yes. Adding to one hundredth layer. It's a... It's still getting one hundredth. Yay! This is a good time to make some kind of like really crazy face. Well, you're applying it. I'm like that? Yeah. Oh, guys, you see those. This is so gross. Do? You. Oh, my gosh. I literally feel like I... Okay. Doesn't it look like I just did a Kylie Jenner lip challenge? Look at that. Guys, I did the Kylie Jenner lip challenge. Just kidding. Instead of doing the Kylie Jenner lip challenge to get your lips to look so big, just do this. Guys, yeah. Oh, look big and clumpy. It's nice. It's so amazing. No, you get to peel it off. How do you use it? Oh. Ugh. Thank you. Oh, look at my lip is ripping. Oh, yeah? Like this? I just thought like from right to left or left to right, maybe? Oh, it's... Okay, what are you saying? Oh, this is... Can I like, you're scraping like wax or something? All the way like that? Yeah, you just got to dig under it and just slide it over. Ugh. That's not what I want to do. Ew, it's like wet and dry the same time. It is clumpy. It's clumpy. What is up with my lip? Ew. I'm not messing. I literally feel like I'm ripping my lip off. Ugh. Ugh. This is gross. That's pretty much what happens when you put 100 layers of liquid lipstick on you. Yeah. So... My commentary throughout it was something. Oh, great. I don't know how to get stained in a bowl. So what do we do to be challenged? Somebody to do this? Anybody who dares to like put 100 layers? If you dare to put all of this on your lips, then you shall... Ow. You shall do it. You should. It's gross but... I'm interested. Oh, great. Alright, so that's about it. We gotta do some other things today. So, I guess Wednesday. Wednesday. Wednesday will be the time to check back. Oh my god. Oh, okay. Wow. Wednesday. That was a little scary there. I guess that light had to go. Literally. Yeah. How do you get this off? Yeah. You, you, the thing. You, you, you, the coconut oil? Yeah. You, you, the thing. You, you, you, the coconut oil? You can dry it. I don't have some flamsum. Oh. How all stuff to my lip? Well, I was falling with that.
