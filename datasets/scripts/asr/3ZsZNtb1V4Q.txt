 Hey guys it's Paul welcome to my kitchen you know we're coming into the holidays and maybe that's what it is maybe there's a little bit nostalgia for me about my mom's kitchen but lately I found myself wanting to cook a lot of the foods like from when I was a little guy and I'd go in my mom's kitchen and smell all those great smells and of course the food was always outstanding so I just saw today this is kind of my take and one that my mom used to make a lot that I always enjoyed you know we always whenever we went to the relations and holidays they always had this me not you know as a mean dish but was usually a side dish and so today I just want to jump right into it and show you I'm gonna do some kabasin sour crowd and it's just totally easy it's just putting those together basically cutting up the kabasin mixing it with the crowd but it always made such a good side dish and I was looking on YouTube and there's a ton of videos but they're all showing like cooking it for five or six hours and if you know me we're way too lazy to cook like that we can get a put pulse spin on it so that's what we're going to do here I'll show you usually if it takes more than 30 minutes I wouldn't be interested in doing it I guess I'm too busy or too lazy or something so this this is real quick but I'll tell you what it's pretty tasty okay you can see I've got my trusty skillet here and I cut off a little lump of butter and just start to melt that why get that melt in the low get one dot just low heat just a melt the butter a little and if you hear some snoring in the background that's just my dog he's getting on my little bit of a nap and that sometimes he does get a little loud and let's see this is what we're using today Polish kabasa now the important thing to remember about this is it's already pre cooked so we're basically just going to be reheating it now if you don't buy the stuff that's already pre cooked of course be careful to make sure that you cook it properly but we don't have to worry about this it's already fully cooked and we're just going to be basically reheating it so that makes it real convenient real quick so I'm just going to open this up and we'll start cutting it off okay so not some magical about this we're just going to cut it this is the way I like it so that's the way we're doing it here if I can show you this is about the thickness I'm not too worried about it something like that seems to work good we just plop those in our skillet as we go I just got it on real low heat just melting the butter you want the first ones to be burning before you get the last ones cut course this dish meets my number one requirements of being two things before I want to make it cheap and easy two favorite words and this dish is both of those it's really easy to make it's fairly cheap and it's softly tasty it's good any time but you seem to see it a lot around the holiday time of course my mom was full Hungarian and she married my dad was English Irish from Tennessee so I guess it makes me at least proud of him I'm here okay guys he's been cooking down a little bit and I like him when they're a little bit more done probably than a lot of people but they actually start to instead of being flat they start and they sort of like cave in or something they're not flat anymore put that way they can occur that's what I know pretty much done I just got me can of some sour crab put that in there it's cheap and easy get a meal for about three bucks tasting it it's one can of sour crab I usually put into it so not some special just plain can of sour crab it's like 14 and a half ounces I guess just where we're here I put into a home usually goes good okay you can see it's starting to cook down real nice well a little bit of the liquid in there but not too much so it's cooking off nice and you can see like him every once while one or the little sausages I'll have a little bit of where it looks like you know it's been cooked that's good so it's looking good I know I can hear the comments are racing cooking sausage and butter I didn't say this was specifically for weight loss I think they said it was Julia child's home I should look it up just came to my mind I know I think she said basically everything's better with a little bit of butter so whoever said it I'm with him I have a little bit of butter that keeps everything from sticking it's good flavor to it now the hardest part about this dish is to stop sinpling it while it's heating I'll tell you what it's good and I'll tell you what the best part too is the smells and I don't know if you hit a man that cooked like a ethnic dish like this or not but and I'm not sure this is probably not at all how she did it sure smells the same sure sure tastes good I mean probably take you 10 or 15 minutes and about three dollars for the ingredients and get a couple meals off of it so that's good just the way it is like that I'd say this is about ready to eat and sometimes I like I just put a dash or two of soy sauce in there just a little bit of flavor a little bit of saltiness a little bit of color I don't think I found much that doesn't taste good with a little bit of soy sauce maybe cake that's pretty good anyway guys you get the idea just let it simmer down a little bit and I think we're about done okay guys so that's about the finished product has a nice color to it just a little bit of juice with it and that's really tasty okay you too well I think that's a wrap I hope you'll try it I think you'll enjoy it and like I say it takes about 10 15 minutes so it's really quick and it's really cheap about three dollars worth of ingredients give or take and you'll get a couple meals of it and to me it's good as a main dish but most people use it as a side dish but the best part of course is they had a Roman that you get in the kitchen of the sauerkraut and the sausage cooking it's just phenomenal and it takes me right back to my mom's kitchen in the nostalgic type of way and so that's worth it just there but I hope you try this one I hope you like it let me know what you think in the comments and as always I really do appreciate you taking a little bit of your day to spend with me here and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoy cooking it for you so until next time thanks for watching
