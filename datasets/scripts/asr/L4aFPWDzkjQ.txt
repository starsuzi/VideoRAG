 I've seen this DIY in Pinterest and have wanted to try it for a while and I wanted to see if it actually works and it does. So let's get started. For this DIY you'll need a mason jar, glass paint, you can get a variety of types. This one is transparent, a sponge brush, and a toilet paper roll, and parchment paper and a baking sheet are optional. Start by cutting the toilet paper roll in half. You're going to use this as a prop to hold the jar off of the table. You're going to want to clean your glass jar with rubbing alcohol before you do anything, but since I didn't have any on hand at the time, I used an alcohol wipe. After it's dried off, you can start painting your first layer. You're going to want to let that dry for an hour. Then paint the next layer on. You should try to paint it in an up and downward motion. Let the second layer dry for another hour. I wasn't satisfied with just two layers, so I painted a third layer and then let that dry for two hours before moving on to the next step. The next step is optional. When your layers are completely dry, place your jar on a baking sheet with some parchment paper. If you choose not to use an oven, you can let it dry for 21 days to let the paint cure. Make sure that you follow the instructions on your bottle of paint, mind-set to bake in a cooled oven and preheat to 275 for 30 minutes. When the jar is then baking, turn the oven off and open the door and let it cool completely before handling. And you're done! Thanks so much for watching my newest video.
