 Welcome to the German sausage maker. Today we'll make carcass-like sausage. It's a polished sausage and well here is how you do it. Here we got the spices, the garlic powder, coriander, that make paprika, white pepper, curry salt and extraoses. Okay that is also in our spice set. You can order to the shop. Give it a quick mix. Okay we split about half to the pork and half to the beef meat. You want to mix it. Okay that was the beef. And now we do the pork. Put the pork in the cooler so we can work with the beef meat. Okay put the meat in the... We have to put some ice cold water in there. A little bit more. Okay. And put everything right into the world. Otherwise you have a hard time cleaning. I have to get the bigger bowl. Okay. Okay. Almost forgot. Must have teets. Still need some more water. That's how it works like. I put the meat in the cooler and get the stuff ready. For this job we need about 16 foot of casing. And I use this is caliber 2030. Okay. This is ready to use casing. Don't need to water. To check the casing we fill it with water. To open it. I hope you can see. See the water bubble? Okay. Test it go all the way through. So you can make sure the casing is open. Okay. Okay. Test it. Okay. Test it. The corner in the cup. Holders. That will work. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I'll just now brew at about 60 to 70 degrees. For about 20 minutes. Put the sausages in cold water to stop the cooking right away. That's in there for a while. And after that we dry the sausage to tomorrow morning and then cold smoke it. Okay. Going to cut one. And then we'll cut the smoke green. Oops. Thanks for watching. I hope you liked it. And I'll see you back next time. Until the gas stove. Bye. Bye.
