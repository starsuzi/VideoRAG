 Hello everybody welcome to my channel for a love of beauty. I am here to show you guys how to save your candle jars. This one is almost burnt out and now this is what it looks like. What are you going to do? Am I going to throw this jar away? Nope I will not. I am going to reuse this jar. First I am going to take the top off and I am going to place it in warm soapy water. And with this jar I am going to place it over into some hot boiling water. I am going to keep spinning it around until the candle melts. And also make sure you put that paper over into the water too because it will loosen up the heat of on the back of the paper. So the candle is melting and you can remove the candle from the jar with a knife or fork. Yes just throw that remaining wax away. And now go ahead and pull out the remaining melted wax into the trash can and what have you. And see the paper just comes right off because the hot water has loosened up the adhesive that is on the back of the paper. And go ahead and place it over into some warm soapy water and you are going to wash it clean. It is hard for me to do it with one hand. And go ahead and dry it. You know, dry. You can also leave it out to air dry after you have been dried off the excess water. And there you have your clean candle jars. What are we going to fill it with? I am going to fill it with peppermint. Yes peppermint candies. You also can decorate your candle jars. So later down the line I may decorate it. Then the next jar I am going to place some cinnamon candies, you know, over into the jar. And there you have it. Your candy jars. And you can put anything you like into these jars. So thank you all so much for watching and I have more videos to come. Thank you. Bye bye.
