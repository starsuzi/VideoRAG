 Welcome back to Sovita Everything Guys. Today, a time experiment. Check it out. After my garlic experiment video, you guys have always been asking me which one is better goga fresh, time, or dry time. And today we're going to find out which one is best. For today's goga, I'm using these beautiful bony and ribeye steaks. I'm only seasoning them with salt and pepper. Now I'm just going to be adding them to the steaks and we are ready to go. I'm cooking these beautiful steaks at 135 degrees Fahrenheit for 2.5 hours. We got our steaks ready. We hungry. Let's take it out. Well, I got to tell you, it smells like thyme, doesn't it, mamah? A lot. Like a lot of thyme. But this one right here, guys, which you guys know which one it is, is a lot harder to remove the thyme than it is this one here. But anyway, like always, I am going to pet these beautiful steaks dry and we're going to go outside and sear them. I know they don't look good right now, but watch this. My good friend, Ninja, what do you think, bro? I think that's beauty and perfection at the same time. I agree with you. Enough talking, let's cut it off and let's do it. Hey, man. Melon. He's just hungry. I don't blame him. All right. My good friend, Ninja, we have an experiment. We have state A and B, which you already stole the first one. I haven't tried it, okay? Are you ready to try this? I'm ready to try it, yeah. I want to know which one is better. Go for it, Ninja, please do. I'm going to get one. Wow. How is it, brother? It's good. It's really good. You don't want to say anything? No, I don't want to say nothing. Okay, go for the next one. It's looking good. That's a good grass that, bro. Good grass. That one is delicious. Awesome. Ninja, you like the second one better? Hell yeah. Wow, surprising. Number B. Number B. My turn. Let's do this. It's been a while that we don't eat an amazing steak, everybody. It's good. This one is fantastic. This one is incredible, everybody. Let's go for the next one. Second one. How do you call that grass? I forgot the name, but. Pine tree. The pine tree. No, no, no. That pine tree is awesome, bro. It's time, time, time. Pine tree. Pine tree branches. Wow. You can feel a lot more of the pine tree on this one, bro. You feel that pine in there, man. That's crazy. No, mom, what do you think? We're good. This is prime. Why, mom? Why, mom? Why you say that? Does it feel like prime? It feels like prime. Or heat looks for you a million. Amazing taste. Very tender, very flavorful. Biffy. Very good. Nice. How about the second one, mom? You're okay, baby. I'm not okay. Woo. Mom, mom. Is there a difference, mom? Pine tree is the key to unlock the richness. It's awesome. I like this one. Because I don't like very strong flavor of the pine tree. Pine tree, mom. Pine. I don't like the pine taste on my steak. All right, guys. Now here's the deal. We got both steaks are exactly exactly the same. But here we got fresh thyme, aka pine tree. And this one we got dried pine. In your opinion, Ninja, which one do you prefer, A or B? Go to the park. Cut that tree down. Bring it to your house and live for a week in there. And there you do it. So you'll dry, dry thyme for your customers. Hell yeah. Mom, which one do you like better? I prefer the fresh. Mom, I'll prefer the fresh. Guys, I gotta be honest with you, this one is a lot stronger. Yeah. Pine tree taste. Nice one. Nice flavor. It's not like overcoming. No, it's not over par. It's really nice. So there's the result, guys. If you want a light thyme taste, this one is fantastic. But if you want a strong pine tree taste, go with this one, right Ninja? Give it a try, man. You might go with Dow one all the time. Yeah. I see what you did this. I see what you did that. It's good. There's your result, guys. Both of them are great. One is just stronger than the other.
