 And while I'm here, let me introduce you to Billy, our cat. Billy arrived to us. We went over to the cat's protection leg over at Dundal and got Billy. And kept us up the whole night, the first night, because we thought we needed to lock them into the kitchen. And it wasn't a good idea. Meow the whole night. But once he has the run of downstairs in the house, he was quite happy. And after three or four weeks, you're allowed to let them out. And we thought that whenever we let Billy out, that he might sort of disappear, not know his way back, but he knows his way back. Because he knows where the grub is. But this is a pyramid sleep area that we bought at Christmas. And we didn't think that Billy would be awfully amused by this. But actually, he has taken to it like a duck to water. And he jumps into it and turns in. And I think it sort of remains about being in the womb or something like that, you know, being so enclosed. It's warm and cozy. And even whenever the hoover's on in this room, he knows that he's safe in his little pyramid. So that's Billy the cat. He's about... ...yet years old now. Not right, Billy. Billy by... Orange Billy, of course. And I know some of you out there are cat lovers. So I'll just add on the sweet bit of very belly. Billy is some pup. He is scared of his own shadow. He walked past a mirror the other day and he jumped in fright whenever he saw an image of himself. Are you good boy, Billy? Yes! Yes! I was a little worried down on the road and Billy got scared. So Woffe goes into his territory. This stupid Billy cat. He does bring a lot of fun to the family. Billy!
