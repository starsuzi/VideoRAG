 Hey friends, everyone loves brunch and one of the best things to take brunch to the next level is a wicked over-the-top cocktail. A classic Canadian brunch time hero rock star cocktail is a Caesar. It's spicy, it's savory, there's a huge garnish action going on. It's a little over-the-top, it's super awesome. It seems like we've got a lot going on here, but really it's pretty quick and easy to throw together, and it's super impressive at your brunch table. So we've got our scratch-made mix ready to go, the exact measurements are in my cookbook, but in here we've got clam juice, tomato juice, horseradish lime juice, smoked paprika, hot sauce, and Worcestershire. All mixed together, it tastes like an explosion of awesome. So next we want to get our glass ready to go, take a lime, we want to rim the top of this glass with the lime juice just to get it nicely covered, and that way our steak spice is going to stick properly. So you want to dunk that lime into the steak spice, get it nicely coated, it's going to taste awesome, it's going to look fantastic. So after you're done with the steak spice, hit the glass with a nice bit of ice. So with ice in the glass, hit it with about four ounces of mix, this is going to get the mix nice and chilled, next hit it with about two ounces of vodka, and then it's time to garnish up. So for our garnishes, we've got some nice celery stocks here, we're going to go in with the celery stocks, we've got some nice caramelized candied maple bacon, candied vodka, with a little bit of lime zest, and maple syrup, it's super incredible. We're going to go in with a nice pickle, and last, but not least, the PS2 resistance, we're going to go in with a crab leg, and that friends, hot damn, that is an epic brunch time cocktail.
