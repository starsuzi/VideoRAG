 Hi everyone this is Anna Veriano from Perfect Resonance Natural Health Counseling and today I'm coming to you from my beautiful backyard to share a tip with you about how you can dry herbs. Whether you're picking the motor of your garden at this time of year or you've just bought a batch at the grocery store it's a shame to let any unused fresh herbs go to waste so I'm going to show you how to dry herbs a really easy way and today I'm using mint because that's what I have coming out of my ears right now I have tons of this in my garden so every once in a while I'll pick a nice bundle of it and what I'll do is all attach it with a rubber band so I have this nice little bouquet and I'll hang it up somewhere to dry. You can hang it in your house at this time of year I like hanging it outside in the sunshine preferably under some kind of roof where it won't get wet if it rains and it takes about a week and then it will dry out so here's the batch that's nicely dry and you'll know and it's ready because when you touch the leaves they should just crumble apart and I put it in a bag and I scrunch it and I rub it until all the leaves come off and eventually what I am deaf with is all of this lovely dried mint. Now mint is great fresh I like to add it to vegetable salads fruit salads I have a really nice recipe for mint to seeke on my website at perfectresonance.com you can find it in the recipe section or just do a search for mint in the search bar of my website and mint has some amazing health benefits primarily it's known as an anti-spasmodic herb an anti-spasmodic means that it reduces clamping which is really beneficial for digestive issues so if there's any gas or bloating or issues with bowel movements you should try adding some mint into your meals and snacks in fact there's studies that show that mint has reduced the symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome so another really great way my favorite way actually to use all of this dried mint is to make a mint tea and mint tea is really really soothing to the tummy and it's so simple to make once you have your dried mint tea you put about a tablespoon or two it doesn't really matter about a tablespoon or two into a pot of boiling water and you let it sit seat for about 10 minutes and then you have a gorgeous tea that's not only delicious but offers you the health benefits as well so I hope you'll try that out and a very annual perfect residence natural health counseling partnering for a healthier more vibrant you
