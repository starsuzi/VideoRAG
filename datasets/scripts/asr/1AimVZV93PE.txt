 Hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I wanted to give you guys a little review on this bag right here along with some ways that you can use the bag a way to shorten the straps without a fuss so it won't be too long because I know that that's like number one concern for a lot of people and I wanted to also do like a mini what's in my bag because I've been using it pretty much all a week and measurements just details and what to look out for what to watch out for pretty much if you are interested in this bag this is the video you want to watch and if you are new to my channel hi my name is Gina I really hope you end up enjoying this video and if you do I will love for you to consider subscribing I'm gonna get started with the details of the backpack itself then I'm gonna jump into measuring the bag for you because I know that you know the measurements are on the website you can find it on the Louis Vuitton website but the measurements are not always accurate so I'm gonna measure it with you and then I'm gonna tell you guys or show you guys briefly what's in my bag if you guys want to want to have like a more accurate video of what fits inside the bag and I can start juggling all my stuff let me know in the comments down below and I'm out for sure to like a more detailed what fits in this bag video so let me know if you're interested in that but I'm gonna just show you guys what's inside this bag and then I'm gonna throughout the video show you guys much shots of what it looks like on my body frame I am 5 to and about 118 pounds give or take 20 pounds something like that but I'm gonna show you guys that and show you guys how to shorten these straps to a shorter setting just because when I wear it in the shortest setting available with the with the four straps in total it's still a little long I think in my opinion used as a backpack so I'm gonna show you guys that as well all right so this is the pump springs mini backpack I believe there are three sizes in total you have the mini the PM and the MM which is the largest if I'm not mistaken this currently only comes in the monogram but they do have like one two three four different kinds of monogram so you have the regular one you have the one that's black and red then you have the world tour which is where you can customize it and put your own stickers on it and or little patches on it and then you have the reverse style which is like it's the opposite of this so instead of the brown is the khaki and you know the other way around so you'll probably be able to find all that in the internet this backpack has the black left treated leather which is super convenient because I don't have to worry about canvas so I really love that aspect and I also love the way it looks with the brown and the black I just feel like it gives it that modern twist to it and I absolutely love it this comes in the gold tone hardware so anything with the hardware it's all in gold and this is what the side looks like this is what the back looks like and then this is what the other side looks like that's what the top looks like and the bottom okay so as you guys can see there's padding going in the back and going down I feel like this is really helpful not for comfort wise but because when you start putting your backpack in or when you start putting things in your backpack this prevents it from bolting out because if you guys know what canvas feels like literally things could start sticking out bolting out it kind of starts getting dented like that it gives it like that dented look right there because I have kind of stuff in there and the zipper and all that so this gives it like that firm look which I think that it's like a really nice touch and then same with the bottom because obviously if you're carrying this backpack you don't want things to be kind of bolting out and sagging you have the the four rings on the top you have two on the top two on the bottom and this is what obviously makes it into a backpack so currently I have it in the lowest setting and I'm gonna actually insert a clip right now showing you guys what it looks like on the shortest setting in my opinion it does look a little long on me but I'm throwing it on the side with both of the straps hanging I think that looks really really cute so you know not using it as a backpack per say but you know if I have it as a backpack I could throw it over my shoulder and kind of look use it as a shoulder bag I think that's a really cute look I'm gonna show you guys some tips that you should look out for if you are I guess picky obviously if you're not picky then that's that you do you but I'm gonna show you guys what I look for when I purchase this backpack so a lot of people were actually complaining about how this is not aligned all the time and it's kind of hard to find the perfect alignment luckily when I got a call saying that this had arrived I was lucky enough to find one that had like that perfect aligning and also another thing that I learned through research and watching other videos and all that is that this sometimes comes a cricket or it's not aligned with the monogram going around it itself you also have to look at that this will never match up just because you have this slight top right here if you guys see the dome it kind of curves down so obviously this is not gonna match up but one thing that you can look at is that this kind of looks similar to the other side but honestly that's just not a big deal for me and then in the back that the stitching is stitching down right in the center of that but anyways it has like these little leather patches right here which you have to be careful a lot of people were having trouble with these things sticking out because it kind of shows a lot more wear quicker not everybody really cares where it's made of but what I've seen is I've seen some made in France made in Italy made in Spain and made in the USA so these are pretty much made anywhere and everywhere so if you are picky about that then it's kind of hard hard err to find your perfect piece but as mentioned in the beginning of the video I really want to show you guys how to shorten this drafts because I only watched one video that actually shared that I don't remember who made that video but it was really really helpful if you're watching thank you for making that video and showing us how to shorten the straps in an easier way I'm gonna try to find the name of the youtuber and I'll link it down below if you guys are interested in watching her video as well but thank you if you are watching anyway um so I'm gonna measure this bag with you guys right now I have the measuring tape right here so hopefully it's just not gonna be too annoying the sound of the measuring tape but the bottom from I'm gonna measure from this line over to that line and it's six inches three and a half inches and all the way up to the top of the pocket it is four and a half inches the height from the lower part of the dome it's about eight inches oh sorry guys the higher part of the dome so that's towards the back it's about eight and a half inches so those are the measurements for this bag and I'm gonna get into what's inside of my bag I've been using this bag for like the last week or so two weeks on and off I switch out on my bags a lot guys so this little pocket right here is very inconvenient I'm sure you guys have watched other videos reviewing this backpack and they are pretty much the same thing but it is it's very inconvenient not because of the size of the pocket because it's a pretty decent size but the problem is is the opening the opening is really tight and it's small so for your hands to fit through the opening that's when it becomes a castle so I don't know about putting change in there because you will take forever to try to reach your change to be honest with you maybe bills you can probably do bills because you just kind of slide it out what I put in here so what I put in this little pocket is just tissues because honestly I don't really reach for tissues that often you see what a hassle that was but I just put up a little bag of tissues and I just keep it in there obviously if I need it for emergencies I know that it's always going to be there but the opening is just a hassle it's really really tight so just to fit your hand in there it's just it's a hassle but it's useful because you can store cash in there you can store you know your tissue of lip gloss your buds or stuff like that you can fit in there but I want to recommend you put something that you have to like constantly reach to because it's just going to be annoying so that's a little bit of that the zipper is really really smooth I want to give you guys a tip that my essay told me about this zipper I noticed that people open try to open it like just regularly and that is going to give you a struggle because you have this little lip right here that's sticking out to kind of even out the the front so it's gonna be a struggle for you to open it that way what my essay gave me as a tip is to always push this backpack in outside and that is going to make it a lot a lot easier to open versus versus just regularly so you know kind of push it in and that's when you close it to it's just smooth very smooth and when you open it same thing you push this in and so much easier so that is one tip that I learned and I really hope you guys you know if you guys didn't know there's a tip so the zipper is really really smooth I don't have a problem with that I really like it but for me if I'm running errands or whatnot I usually keep my backpack half way I leave it halfway just you know big enough for me to kind of reach in and out and obviously if I know I'm not gonna be needing my backpack for a while they'll just keep it closed but typically I just leave it that way so now the inside has like this black cloth material lining it's somewhat wipeable I hope with my research I was told that it's very easy to wipe down and I'm gonna show you guys what's in my backpack once again this video is not going I'm not gonna go in and show you guys like what fits and takes the file takes put the fit if you want that kind of video let me know and I will be happy to do it I just didn't think that I wanted to make this video super long so I'm just gonna show you guys what's inside and then I'm gonna show you guys how to work with the straps and all of that so this is what it looks like so when you have to reach in you kind of have to fold this down and reach into your items and I don't have it super super packed but I will tell you guys that a long wallet does fit but only towards the back so laying down flat towards the back and it'll fit like perfectly but anyways so what I have in here is my Demir a Ben card case and in here I have one two three four five six seven cards currently I also have my key pouch with my key fob and my perfume and to show you guys a little bit of what it looks like it's exactly like close up that's what it looks like so it's about the same size obviously you don't want to put that in there and then I have a receipt from Target and then I have this is where I'm currently keeping my cash and my coins this is my Armas Bastille absolutely love this piece and it's just super convenient I like folding my cash I folded two ways and I just put it in here and it's just it just fits perfectly as very convenient my coins fit in here and the days that I know I have to use cash I just take this and it's just like I said convenient and then I have my little Chanel perfume this is chance and I absolutely love this and then I have my mini pushet and I shared this in my blog video that I posted so this is one of the items that I picked up and I absolutely love it I'm so happy I'm so happy to have it back in my collection and in here I have I have the lip gloss that I'm currently wearing which is a benefit the gloss what color is this LG 15 and I have some lotion at Bill spray hand sanitizer spray from the honest company I have some Neosporin and Ibiotics band-aids and this is what's making so much noise so I have like a little thing of band-aids in there so that's what I have and that's all I have I have my sunglasses I had my sunglasses in here but I left it in the car but it fits in here as well and then in the back you have that little slip pocket which is also made out of same material and mine is says Bluey Vuitton made in France which I was extremely happy about because you know here in the States or here in California it's super super hard to come by on maiden France piece of the fact that I was able to get this from the store made in France with the perfect alignment and everything it was just to die for I was so super stoked just to give you guys an idea of how deep the pocket goes I'm gonna show you guys with the card case and put it all the way back there and you won't be able to see the card case because the card case is pretty much like right there so if I go like this you can see it so just so you guys can idea of how deep the pocket and the back is if anyone if anybody was interested in that so you can use this backpack four or five different ways the first one being top handled like this I feel like this is one of the ways that I use it when I'm kind of in the rush here going there I don't want to like you know use a crossbody or go through the hassle to you know throw it in crossbody or backpack or whatever and I'm just literally in a hurry running out of the car I describe it like this and this is how I carry it it's very convenient and I really love the fact that that's there then you have the backpack way which is how it is right now the other way that you can wear it is you take out one strap just clip both of these on the top deereings and it becomes a longer strap obviously you have to adjust this according to your settings the way I adjust mine is I'm actually going to play with this one since I took this one out this is what it looks like you have like these little safety things where you can just loop it through and it just kind of stays intact and you take it off so you have a short strap and then you have a longer strap and you have two of those you have two of these and two of these and it has like that little nob sticking out so you can hook it up with the holes so for backpack like I showed you guys it was in the shortest setting for this my perfect setting I am 5-2 is 1-2-3-4-5 so I use the fifth so from the bottom from the shortest one I go 1-2-3-4 and I click it on the fifth so that's what my perfect setting is as a shoulder bag and as a crossbody so I'm gonna show you guys what it looks like on my shoulder and I really like that look I think the look the drop is perfect and it's very comfortable I don't have any problems with the leather being like digging into my shoulder it is nothing this black leather it's nothing compared to the Demier Aben type of leather because the Demier Aben leather it does kind of dig into your shoulder a little bit but this one I find that it's a lot softer so I don't have that problem with that and also you can wear a crossbody and it's also the same setting and I really like it the way it looks crossbody it's actually not too long not too short it hits on my hips and I really like it I feel like it's very comfortable and it just I love the look of how it looks like and then you also have it where you're able to get take one of these out you keep one on this corner and you click it diagonally and that gives it that I don't know if you guys are familiar with this but long time ago like old school back in day they came up with backpacks that kind of looked like this and you kind of throw it on to crossbody and your backpack kind of had like that slanted look so that's the look that it gives I really don't like the way that looks with this backpack because I feel like this backpack is too small for that but once again like I mentioned earlier I love it throwing it on my shoulder kind of like using it as like a shoulder bag but with both straps as a backpack but it but I feel like if you have one and one that it kind of that gives it a little bit of a different look and I think it's a pretty cool look as well so now I'm gonna get started with showing you guys how to shorten this straps without being too long and actually I think it looks better that way as well so I'm gonna show you guys this and hopefully you guys will be able to see so I still have the two straps the longer ones and the shorter ones are down here so to be able to shorten this strap I'm gonna get rid of the shorter straps completely because I'm not gonna be needing them so let's take those out so I took those out and now I'm just stuck with this right with this so this is what you do you grab one of the straps and you're gonna do the same thing on both sides obviously you want it to be a backpack so you're gonna try to put this through the loop without using that so what we do is we loop this through hold on let me let me know you loop this through the outside and you see how that is a little too high for the steering so what you have to do is kind of go towards the oh this is gonna be hard to show so it's you have to go towards the side like this and you have to put in your back like this little flat area will go in through the steering first and then it just it would be a lot easier if I had a hard surface all right let me do this again so you put it through and you have to get this part a flat area first so that's what it looks like on the side do you guys see how I did that so that's what it looks like on the top that's what it looks like again and then you just push it through like that you see that so then this this part right here obviously you you want to kind of you want to kind of see how short you want it I use it so I leave one hole on the top and I use it on the second one like this and I just clip it it's little thing and then you put it down to kind of hold it you guys see that and that's how it becomes a shorter strap I'm gonna show you guys what it looks like on with the shorter strap it looks a lot better and so this is what it looks like it's just shorter and that's what it looks like folded so I'm gonna do it again on this side so again you grab the the loose strap and you make sure that it's from the outside you're going into the bag so you're not putting it this way but you're going this way okay let's see if I can show you guys better so that's what it looks like you push this through and like that did you guys see how I just did that let's hope so and then I fold this over to my second hole setting and cover it so that's what it looks like and it's so much shorter it's very convenient it looks a lot better I really like the way it looks I don't think it's bad at all I think it's it's actually really really smart and maybe it was meant to be used this way I don't know I don't know why not so that is all I have for you guys thank you guys so much for watching if you found this video helpful please give me a thumbs up I really hope that you guys were able to learn something especially if you are doing your research because you're contemplating whether or not to get this bag or not but thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys on my next one bye
