 Here's some tumble glass that we've processed in a rock tumbler. Take a look at how gemmy it is. But we think we can improve the appearance a lot by burnishing it. That's running it in a soap bath in the rock tumbler for a few hours. To find out if your rocks or glass or whatever you've tumbled will be improved by burnishing, you can try the buffing test. Get a piece of whatever you've tumbled. Place it on a soft cloth such as a shirt sleeve and give it a good buffing for 15 or 20 seconds. Buff it fast enough to build up a little bit of heat. Let's take a look. This is the side that's been buffed. This side hasn't. You tell the difference. For burnishing we use an ivory bar soap. Some people have great results using powdered soap such as tide or ivory snow. What we do with the bar soap is we get the bar and cut it so that it makes some small pieces. Then when we load the barrel we place about one tablespoon of soap chips in the barrel for every pound of rock. Here's our material loaded in the barrel. What we're going to do is add a couple tablespoons of plastic pellets, shake them down. We're going to add some water up to about the level of the top of the material and then we're going to add our soap chips. Now we're going to seal that up and tumble it for a few hours. We have the glass lid on the tumbler so you can see what's happening inside. It's just getting started and out of soap hasn't dissolved. We just opened the barrel from burnishing and you can see how it's a white foam. What we're going to do is get the material out and clean it up and we'll be right back to show it to you. Here's our end result, a nice, jemmy glass with a very bright luster.
