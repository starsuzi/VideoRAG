 Hey good morning Chuck here with AppleGrains. Today we're putting in the downspout drains off of this house. We're gonna come down along this wall, pick up the second downspouts, continue on out there by the fence. Water's getting in this crawl space coming from these downspouts and from yard. Okay so we've got our trench pretty much completed as you can see coming off of the downspout turns. We're gonna take our excess soil and actually mount it up here along the side to help this water flow away from the system. We'll tie in that downspout and then it just runs right out to the back. We're gonna put a cat spacing right here to help catch some of this water that's coming down this hill right into our cat spacing about right here. So we've added a cat spacing. We decided to move it down the hill here because this is a low spot coming down the hill up there. Water will drop into here and maybe it'll help it from coming around this corner. You can see our downspouts hooked up all the way down, covering it up. This is gonna discharge right out here at the end of the yard. Hey this is Chuck with AppleGrains. You know this is a job that I hope learned or could do themselves. It's only took us a couple of hours with two guys. Of course we do have a really great trencher but you know basically you can see this water that comes down this hill and it comes right up into their cross base and of course the cross base has been getting wet. So what we've done is we've added downspout drains one there one at the front with a cat spacing here on the hill to pick up the water as it comes down and this charges out by the fence. We took our excess put it up here against the cross base and graded it away so that water has to flow away from this foundation and into the cat spacing. Hey this is Chuck with AppleGrains reminding you that if you believe you can do something I guarantee you can do it.
