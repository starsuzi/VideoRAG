 Hi, I'm Raymond and I want to introduce you to the American Classic Fosette with a brass side spray. The faucet and the sprayer are both constructed of solid brass. The Victorian spout has a high 12.5 inches from the deck and also can swivel 360 degrees. The faucet includes a single handle, ceramic disc, cartridge. This faucet can be installed in a 2-4 hole constructed sink. This faucet is an old-world style with a contemporary water saving feature located in the air grid. A highlighted feature in the American Classic Fosette is the solid brass constructed side spray. A lot of other faucets come with plastic side sprays but this one comes with a brass solid constructed side spray that the design flows great with the design of the faucet as a smooth trigger for its preling the water. The long 48 inches braided hose is great for clean off messes around the countertops, watering a couple of plants above the window. The sprayer has a great weight to it so you actually feel like you're holding something. You'll love this popular Victorian design.
