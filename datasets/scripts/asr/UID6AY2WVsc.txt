 Hi, I'm Angie from Angie Southern Kitchen.com. Today we're going to make white balsamic vinaigrette. I do this in the quiz and art and this is our finished product. It requires four tablespoons of honey and of course there's all different types of honey. This is clover honey but you can use any kind. And four tablespoons of d'Jan mustard and this is a shallot. I really like adding shallots to my vinaigrette. A shallot is kind of like in between an onion and a garlic and you need to mince your garlic and your shallots. It takes two teaspoons of your garlic and two tablespoons of the mince shallot and then we have chives. And I add two teaspoons of the chives. One fourth cup of white balsamic vinaigrette and half a cup of the olive oil and I put it all in the quiz and art and run it. And a little bit of salt and pepper to flavor it and then you have a wonderful vinaigrette for your shallots. Again I'm Angie from Angie Southern Kitchen.com and you just learned how to make white balsamic vinaigrette.
