 Uh-oh 24 hours. I put this cream. This is probably about 5 cups, maybe 6 cups of heavy 40% milk fat cream in the oven. I turn the oven on to 320 degrees Fahrenheit, not 350, 320. Put this in there and turn the oven off. It stayed in there for 10 hours and as as directed and then I took it out and put it in the fridge and spread it overnight. And this is the result. Oh my. It's rather thick and luscious isn't it? This is the clotted cream and more that sounds lovely doesn't it? But this is what they put on their skins. The skins? The skins. Man it's thick. This is what they spread onto their skins or scones or however you want to say it. And this I believe since some I do have blueberry scones, biscuits rather that I believe will be probably the best base for making sauce like for a quick mushroom sauce or garlic sauce to go over pieces of protein from fish to lamb chops to hamburger patties. I saw to add a little bit of mushroom. I put this in the pan. I think that would work wonderfully but we'll give it a try. This is an experiment. Look how luscious and thick this is. That's so cool. We'll take that to church today. Thank you. Thanks. Well I really do want to try that with rice and horse weight. The various coming later so of course won't be available later. Yeah. Yeah we all need to know where there's coming from. That's how you do it. That's how you do it for you.
