 Chicken enchiladas are one of our all-time favorite Mexican dishes, and over the years, we've learned a couple things to make this classic really stand out. First, to keep the chicken filling moist, we like to add some enchilada sauce to it. Not a lot, about a half cup of sauce for every two or two and a half cups of chicken. It really makes a difference in the enchilada's flavor and texture. And second, it really helps to warm up the tortillas before assembling the enchiladas, so they don't split or crack as you roll them. Just wrap in paper towels and microwave for a minute or so, or infoil and heat in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes.
