 Alright everyone, go to here. I have some of my honey. It's fresh, unfiltered, raw, and I've got thinking since I have some dry eyes on hand, what happens when the honey hits the cold dry eyes? 109 degrees below zero. I mean honey gets hard to pour when it's like 40 degrees, so this is not me interesting. Okay, so it's kind of roll around, do it, zoom in, roll it closely, you're after. It's perhaps a little bit more. I'm posting zoom in. It's like trying to roll around, look at that. Definitely get stiff. These pieces are like, look at that. It's like frying an egg. It's called, see what happens when you sandwich it between two pieces. It just slides off, look at that. It's cool, cool, cool, and just cold as I can. Get her down to 100 degrees below zero. I can tell it's getting cold because it's like dragging on the ice. It's like getting high friction now. Here we are. Let's try this. Look at that. Get a good view of that. It's like shatters like glass. You want to get my face in here? Let me cool it down again. Get that off the carpet. Let's get her cold. It's taking my fingers. Just trying to try this. It's like crunchy and it gets soft and chewy and then it liquidifies. It's not bad. Kind of freezes your fingers a little bit, which is unpleasant. I've never seen how to do this. It's like glass, shatters. I can probably grind it up. I'll be something for another time. Until then, I'll see you next time.
