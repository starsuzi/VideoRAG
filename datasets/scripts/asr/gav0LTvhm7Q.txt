 The ingredients for the basic white sauce are very simple. It's 3 quarters cup of chicken broth, 2 ½ tablespoons of Shaoxing wine, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and ½ tablespoon or more of sugar. We just want to mix all of this together. Now this sauce is normally added to stir-fry after the meat and the vegetables have been cooked. It is then thickened with cornstarch. However, if you're going to use it as a pouring sauce, you will need to add some ginger, garlic and onion. Since these things are usually added at the beginning of the stir-fry process, when you're not stir-frying and just using this as either a dipping or pouring sauce, these need to be added in the beginning. Now to start, I'll just add about a tablespoon or so of peanut oil and let it get hot. And once the oil is hot, I'm going to add the ginger, garlic and onion and just stir-fry for about 30-40 seconds. Then I'm going to add my sauce. And to thicken the sauce, you would just use 2 teaspoons of cornstarch mixed with a little bit of water just until it dissolves. And as it just starts to come to a boil, I'm going to stir and add my cornstarch mixture. And I want to keep stirring until it becomes thick. And once it becomes thick, then you can remove it from the heat. Now it is ready to be used either for a dipping sauce or a pouring sauce. I'm going to use this on the steamed mixed vegetables.
