 Psst! We have other channels. Matt here, home forum ideas. And today, I'm just checking out my Rhode Island Red. She's taking a dust bath. And I don't know if any of you know the benefits of dust baths or your chickens. But it keeps away all kinds of parasites. Good organic method to keep away just tons of different kinds of parasites. A lot of people put DE like getting around the coop so that when the chickens take the dust bath that gets DE on it and it's just diatonatious earth. Look it up on YouTube. It basically kills lots of little harmful bugs. It also from what I understand. I don't know if it kills other bugs like bees and stuff. I try to stay away from it because of that. I don't know. But anyways, yeah, dust baths for the chickens really good for them. They obviously enjoy it. And a happy chicken lays more eggs. And then it'll keep mosquitoes off of them and all that. So it's good to have a good spot for them to take a dust bath. Anyways, it's not I'd share it with you guys a little quick. So God bless you guys and have a good day. Because I know red is that good? You enjoying that? Anyway, see you guys later.
