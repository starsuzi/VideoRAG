 Welcome back to DIY Thursday. My name is Nick from LHDCTB.com and today I'm going to show you how to turn one of your old T-shirts into a fashion forward tube top. Stay tuned. Here's what you'll need. In old T-shirts, scissors, measuring tape and a sewing machine. The first thing you'll do is take your measurement around your rib cage right underneath your bust. The next thing you'll do is cut the sleeves from your T-shirt. Next, cut the top portion off of your T-shirt so you are left with two large rectangles of fabric. Now, even up your fabric by cutting just inside the place where your sleeves were. After you've finished, evening up your two pieces of fabric, turn them inside out, right sides facing together. Using your rib cage measurement, divide that number in half and mark this spot in the middle of one side of your fabric. I like to use a glue stick instead of straight pins to hold my two fabrics together because I find that it keeps them from slipping and sliding while I'm sewing. Now all we're going to do is sew a straight line down both sides of our two top. After you're all done sewing, cut off the excess fabric on the outside of your stitch, being very careful not to cut your stitch. And after you flip your two top right side out, you're all done.
