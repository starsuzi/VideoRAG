 I will lose somebody who loves me who makes me feel so proud I am meant to talk about mannequins today and why your wigs cannot fit you you buy your wig caps, you put the wig caps on your head and then you take the wig caps and you put it on your mannequin and because it fits so comfortable when you head you're wondering why when you put it on your mannequin and you make your wig when you take it off it can't fit you the way it works ladies the reason why your wig cap fits your head so comfortable when you put it on your head is because the wig cap stretches it's going to stretch to fit the size of your head so once you put it on a mannequin it's going to stretch to fit the mannequin when you add glue to your wig caps it takes away some of the elasticity of the cap this is not the same size as this it's going to be extremely tight it's going to feel like me trying to fit into a size one that's just not possible all right and if I do fit into a size one you I won't be able to sit my ass down unless you plan on walking around with a ball of aspirins and your pocketbook nobody wants to walk around with a headache put my tight ass wig all day all right I know I've done you can purchase something like this this one costs $40,000 up so this can run you between 40 to 60 bucks depending on the quality of it I guess I could tell you guys the company of who made this one I'm going to let you make your own judgment if you want to purchase from them or not all right this was purchased from his and hers you know that's like a reputable wig making company they sell supplies for you to make wigs my problem with them is first of all you're a United States based company I shouldn't have to wait a month and a half to get my item and if I am going to wait a month and a half you should learn how to communicate with your customers I do however like the quality of this but I just don't know if I will ever purchase one from them again because their life can really good communication skills with their customers when I purchased this on a website it said that this particular one was in stock and then after I waited for about two weeks and I tried to email them they let me know that this had to be custom made because they didn't have any more left in stock in this particular size I don't have a problem waiting but I just want you to let me know what's going on if you choose to buy from them then you know that's your choice I'm not saying they're bad but you're going to have to wait if they don't have any stock you have the canvas block which I just showed you then you have your display mannequins you can also build this up where you can actually make wigs on these particular ones but most people use them to display their wigs and then you have your regular beauty supply store foam kits that you can purchase and you could customize this for a very small fraction of the price this is the one that I purchased I'm going to show you how your wigs want to fit perfect every single time you can choose to use the materials that I'm going to show you or you can go out and you know do what you wish as you can see this is the one that I made 3.5 for years ago very durable as you can hear that that's the sound of the mannequin foam part and then this is the part that I build up all right so this is still in very very good condition it's just that I wanted to make one that was brand new and I also wanted to share what I'd use with you guys go back in my tutorials it's the same way that I had the great duct tape I just went over it with a black duct tape just to make it look a little less ratchet yeah you're going to need your mannequin head I purchased this one from my local beauty supply store for $3.99 duct tape Dollar Tree I got black get whatever color you want I prefer duct tape over packing tape because duct tape is more flexible and you can actually manipulate it so that it can lay flat it won't leave any bumps also going to need a beanie all right it doesn't matter what color it's going to get covered up anyway shelf liners this was purchased also at the Dollar Tree this one have holes in it I like this particular one because it will still allow my teapins to pass through very easily the teapins are still able to go through pretty easily all right it keeps the form whatever form that you create it keeps that form it's kind of like a cross between rubber and foam so when you press on it it's flattened but when you let go the foam rises back up it means that one side is not going to get flat and then the other side is going to stay up it's going to keep the original form that you create these are the measurements that you're going to have to take there are small holes in the styrofoam that was created by the teapins by laying the duct tape down first this is going to hold the styrofoam together so when you put your teapins in it will minimize the size of the holes that's created underneath so that's the reason for the first layer of duct tape these are cut into small strips and I did so so they could lay flat okay so we're going to go through and we're going to take these to the mannequins right now everything look like small patches but we're going to go through and we're going to layer duct tape over top of the shelf liner so everything could be even and flat oh this is the finished product I'm going to stop right here if you need a larger size you can add your beanie to this and then add the duct tape over top of the beanie and that will give you a larger size that the beanie is just going to be for extra padding so you don't have to use as much tape you can either add more of the shelf liner for padding or you can add the beanie for padding as well but for me the project would cost six bucks because the mannequin is $3.99 for dollars shelf liner is a dollar and the duct tape is a dollar so altogether six bucks okay six bucks versus 40 to 60 dollars you pick which one would you prefer and this one is one of last me just as long ladies and gentlemen thanks for watching please don't forget to subscribe, like and share and I will see you soon bye bye
