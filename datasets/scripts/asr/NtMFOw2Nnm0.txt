 Crumble is one of my all-time favourite desserts. An apple and blackberry together is just the perfect combination and then the topping acts like a sponge and she absorbs all that fruity flavour. So once we've washed our blackberries, we need to peel and cut our apple and we want to cut them into the same size pieces so they cook evenly. So once you've chopped your apples, you want to put them into a saucepan with your black breeze. And then we're going to add some maple syrup. And we add a little cinnamon which is so nice for adding warmth and spice and I think I've put a little in the topping too. And finally we put a little water bottom of the saucepan and then we put the lid on and turn on the heat. When you make a crumble, everyone always comes back for more and that's because of the topping and I start mine with almonds. And I'm going to blend these until they form a flower. So this is what you're looking for. Almonds are great, they're a source of protein which is really important for healthy burns. Oh so classic crumble ingredient and they're also high in fibre. And then we just need to grab a saucepan and instead of butter and sugar, we're going to use coconut oil and a little bit more maple syrup. Told you I love to cinnamon. And now we just gently warm this until the coconut oil has melted. Once this has melted, we're going to pour it over the oats and almonds to bind them together. And just make sure you really mix the wet and dry ingredients together. So let's check how our fruit is, it should be perfect by now. That looks really great and soft. So we need a baking dish like this and then we're just going to cover the bottom with the fruit. And then just smooth this out before you put on your nutty oatsy topping. So there it is, it's looking absolutely gorgeous and it's ready to bake. So this is what you're looking for, lovely and a golden brown. And every bite of this crumble is just going to lose with deliciousness. So
