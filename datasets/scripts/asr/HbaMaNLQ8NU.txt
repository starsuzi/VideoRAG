 The GRK Camelian Composite Deckings Group blends in with the Decking material to hide and plane sight. The Camelian is engineered for ease of use, performance you can rely on, and quality you can expect. Saw teeth under the head along with fiber trapping rings help cut a clean hole and pull excess material into the board, preventing mushrooming and dimpling. The case hardened steel used eliminates twisting and snapping. The recessed star drive virtually eliminates stripping with its six points of contact. Seat threads enlarge the hole to eliminate splitting, increase drawstring, and reduce friction for low torque load. The W cut on the first few threads of the screw acts like a saw blade reducing torque and making install easier. And lastly, the self-tapping zip tip allows the screw to be installed without the need for pre-drilling. The Camelian's head comes in common colors of composite and PVC materials, and eliminates mushrooming and dimpling. Its code approved with structural values, and for use, entreated lumber, an ESR-3201.
