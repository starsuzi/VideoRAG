So first I take this and I Turn it on and I spray it on a saddle and then circle I Next up I use this pure needs foot oil and I oil my saddle And that's a leather does not crack See the first step just clean this. This is making it soft so that it does not break Because if your saddle breaks then you have it problem Oh Okay, obviously I'm just doing one side per video purposes, but I will clean the other side and the underside To get all of the things you understand Final step is this restore and conditioner Let the oil dry and then polish it off with the conditioner I know it still hurts from surgery Help then you just do a little squirt of the stuff and rob it in there Oh Car Okay, well My saddle is clean now Thank you for watching my video be sure that you comment what you want to see next so that I know and I can produce videos that you would actually be interested in watching What I think you would be interested in watching Um, please leave a like Maybe be sure and subscribe so that you know when I put no vanity or check out my Instagram jet eventing and Yeah, it's really the only Instagram that matters.
