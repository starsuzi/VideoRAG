 In this video I'm going to show you how to make a perfect floss octagon sealing and pillar base but also how to translate that in a perfect floss foundation octagon shape base and that you can do it with all materials. Hey there my name is Susannis and welcome back to Auction via the vault the building tips and tricks department. Yeah but why this tutorial for Sanis? Well I know I already have a video out there on how to make an octagon shape building tower on top of foundations or on top of pillars and ceilings with use of fence foundations but this time we're going to use a different technique and this technique I've seen in a video of GG fish is an awesome builder content creator and if you don't know him well you know his structures because you have seen his structures in the traders of org. Let me quickly show you the building technique to build an octagon shape base. So first you're going to place a pillar then you're going to place a ceiling on top of it another ceiling and then you connect a fence foundation it has to be on the outside so not the other one no it has to be on the outside and then we're going to go one right over there and we place a wall down another wall so we can place a ceiling there we go and now I need to connect a pillar to it so that is what we're going to do just never build it it is poking through I know it doesn't have to be perfect now so there you have it this is one side this is the other side and then you do the same thing again so place a fence foundation place another one place the wall place another wall and you can extend again place a ceiling and there you go there was the first corner pieces of the octagon shape and with this technique I made this creation and on the first glance it is perfect it is all fine what I'm worried about is with the technique yeah each time you go a section further the ceilings go up higher and in the end you end up with something like this so the last ceiling is much higher than the previous or the first ceiling and with stone it is not a big difference so you almost don't see it but it annoys me a little bit so I thought that that can be more perfect so I use this technique to check out on other materials so first we're going to check out that and that is totally worthless and insane check it out how much higher it gets with each step almost a full ceiling up higher with each step and in the end you have this big difference between the first ceiling and the last ceiling so that is not something we want then we go to wood and wood is totally different than all the other materials so this is the first ceiling we go all the way around and when you come back the ceiling is lower so with wood is the only one that goes with each step lower instead of higher so I thought well let's see the big difference well it is two turd lower than the first one then we go to stone so here we have the full stone again and when you do it in stone it is two turd higher so I thought well these are pretty much the similar but let's check out also Adobe and tech and metal well tech Adobe and metal all works the same so they are about 7-8 higher so this was the first one and this is the final one and that one is almost a full ceiling higher and you can see the difference here also with the tech one and with the metal one as well and I use metal ceilings so you can clearly see the difference better and yeah that lead me to some testing a lot of testing as you can see here well first I had to find out what makes it that the ceiling is going up higher all over with each action that you connect to make this octagon shape and wood and stone are perfect for the test now I have the perfect solution for you so I mix it up and this time like this and this is the perfect solution because check the small difference that you get now it is only this little bump here that is the difference between the wood and the stone ones and I think well it is nicely smooth and like I said not perfect but as smooth as I can get it and how does this translate into the ceilings well check it out here here is the metal and then we get a tech so with tech you can also see a little bit of difference and why the tech snaps lower I don't know I had a full circle of metal and then I changed it with tech and Adobe Adobe you can see here a little bit of a difference well with that you don't see a difference with wood yeah you don't notice the difference at all and with stone well I don't see the difference anymore there is no big difference anymore so I think we found a perfect solution and this is the cheapest solution I could make for you for a two-sealing wide sided octagon shape you don't need the metal of course the metal here is to show you that it is nice and flush and you don't need this last stone ceiling so for this basic stuff you need 8-tats ceilings 14-tats walls 14 wooden fence foundations 4 wooden ceilings 3 stone ceilings and 8 pillars and of course you can make these structures as big as you want these are now two ceilings wide you can make them one ceiling wide or even 10 ceilings wide it's all up to you so let's cover the basics how to do it place a wooden pillar and then place a tats ceiling place a wooden ceiling place those nicely fence foundations and we need one more come on yes then we place the tats walls a tats ceiling again and then we need to place a pillar pillar down you're gonna place this ceiling and then we're gonna place the fence foundations again and that is the basic that you need to do so there we go again and then tats ceiling pillar again come on you need to snap right in there and I'm flying now I know and I use the GCM command but that doesn't matter you can make a catwalk for this or whatever you want you can do this also walking by it that it is not that hard it is just that I want to show you how to do it I can also do this walking it doesn't matter so we have this one on the outside that one then we have this thing over here gonna drop down this one then we have the tats ceiling the pillar yes oh there it was and then we get a stone ceiling again and then you can do the same thing again so right over here on the outside and yeah if you have scaffolding up you have a ramp up you can easily get up here again and you can continue on building so that is not the hardest part and then just one more and then it is finished so this is the basic building stuff that you need for this octagon shape and then you can change the material to anything you like you can for example do it with Adobe it is all up to you so let us remove the wood and let's change it into Adobe and for example if you want to lose these nubs so there we go change it to Adobe and of course you can remove all this kind of things right over here so you don't need that and you need to remove of course the the wooden fence foundations as well and of course the wooden fence foundations need to be gone as well and there you have it that's all you need to do and that's it that's all you need to do and now you can finish the outside off for example with stone walls and of course you have a gap here so keep that in mind if you build for example on a flat area here just use the pillar trick to lower the pillars until for example the wall touches the ground so place a pillar and place another pillar right next to it connect the other one and as you can see they go lower and lower each time you connect one and yeah then you come to a point well maybe this is the good height and you test it out maybe it could go down even further and then this will be your starter point and now I want to show you how to translate these two foundations so you can make perfectly flush foundations in octagon shape first you need to build the basic structure again but you cannot do this technique on surface where they have enabled the structure collision thing because then you get this issue so you need to remove the wall that is still working so let's remove this wall as well and then we need to remove the pillar but check it out you cannot do it because collision is enabled and then you cannot do this so you can only do this on surface where the structure placement collision is disabled because then you can nicely make it and I know it sucks if you play on a server where the collision is enabled and yeah I really don't like the collision part at all because it takes away the creativity okay one last trick for the people that are really finicky and think this difference between the foundation system big connect the ceiling to the foundation that is higher connect the pillar to that and the pillar needs to be lower so this is only high point and this is on the lower point connect that you can place a foundation to that and this foundation is lower than the first one and yet in my opinion it doesn't matter that much it is just a small difference and there you have it ladies and gentlemen now you know how to make a nice flush octagon shape building and go out there and make something beautiful so that's it for this video I hope you all enjoyed if they don't leave a like leave a comment about the video whatever in the comment below and as always if you haven't already you want to burn refuted and smash that subscribe on like a maniac and I will see you all in the next video bye bye
