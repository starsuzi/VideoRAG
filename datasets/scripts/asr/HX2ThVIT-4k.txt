 CleanerGarBoom.com Hi, I'm Luba with CleanerGarNing and today I'm going to tell you about our CleanCantine Water bottle. If you're like most Americans, you drink lots of bottled water. While drinking water is great, all those bottles of water and shipping water all over the world can have a damaging impact on our environment. Let's say you drink one bottle of water per day for 60 days. Now let's do a demonstration of what that would look like. Oops, I'm five short. So, 60 days of plastic bottles or one of these. You choose. That's a pretty drastic demonstration of, but that just goes to show how much waste you can generate in only two months of drinking bottled water. This is a really great alternative because if you like drinking water and saying hydrated, but you want to do so responsibly, you can get rid of your ties to paper cups, styrofoam cups or even plastic bottles. You can help quit filling up our landfills by using just one bottle a day and it's stylish. You can take it anywhere with you and you don't have to worry about hurting our environment. It's single walled, so cold water or warm water is really what you should only put in there. You shouldn't put a hot water in there because it could burn your hands. It's made of stainless steel, so if you're in a bind, you can put it on the stove. Just be sure not to melt the cap or don't touch it with your hands because it will be really hot. It's dishwasher safe, which is great for moms. The cap is made of a polypropylene number five, which means it's a softer alternative. If you're clumsy like me, you will find the bumps on the trail when you're trying to find a slip, but it won't bust your teeth out. As you can see, this is a great alternative to all those plastic bottles. Don't forget, we also sell an alternative loop cap, which is great because it clips on to care beamers or things like that. We love this product and thank you all too. So why don't you give it a try?
