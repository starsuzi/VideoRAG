 Hey what's going on everyone this is Brandon and I'm going to teach you guys how to make a perfect Smoar so here's how you do it first of all you got to have a good fire like that Not too big not too small next you're going to want to Whoa next you're going to want to use jet puff marshmallows. I'm serious not the big huge gigantic ones are ridiculous You want a good jet puff marshmallow? You don't want to go with the cheap kind of marshmallow. You can go with a cheap graham cracker not a cheap marshmallow though Trust me and you're going to want to put obviously the marshmallow on the stick Like so I got my remnant my other one right there So this is not a normal not a normal Smoar this is going to be a What would you call this a reverse and inside out Smoar? That's what we're going to call it an inside out Smoar. So let me show you First of all the roasting the key is Not to burn it the key is golden brown So we're going to cook this thing and you don't you can get fairly close it doesn't take too long to cook a nice looking Smoar The fire is fairly decently hot You don't even have to have perfect coals. That's kind of a myth I mean coals are fine, but you can do it. Okay if you just have something like this Like there's a small fire and you want to rotate continually. You're like roasting a pig here You just want to get every single side golden brown Now before this I forgot to tell you while this is cooking I'll explain this you have your your chocolate You only you want to before you open it up you take the chocolate the Hershey's make sure you use Hershey's Trust me and you want to put it next to the fire and you want to warm it up You'll see why basically we're going to make chocolate frosting inside of that bag So here I am still working on my Smoar here Still working on getting a nice and toasty Brown on the outside you have to go kind of quick otherwise you'll get the inside to You get the inside to Liquid and it will start to sag like this is actually okay actually like this right here So my wife will hold this for me hopefully All right, so let me show you this first of all well, we don't really need this one. Oh, yeah, there we go perfect Ignore that Really bad if this I can't see you okay, okay, you had to take the jupy marshmallow off like so Then you take your melted chocolate that is inside this and what we're gonna do is we're gonna squirt The chocolate out of a little hole that I cut in the top We're gonna score it right onto the top Like so of the marshmallow this melted chocolate right on top You see the problem with most Smoars that you put it between two things the graham cracker and Then it like slides all over an axel awkward and weird it's hard to enjoy Instead what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a piece of graham cracker Like so that's about half of a normal half and you're gonna shove it inside of the marshmallow So you're holding like this now you've got a Smoar and inside out Smoar that you can take a bite of without getting everything all weird and crusty and dirty Amazing, right that chocolate in there and that's how you make it inside out Smoar
