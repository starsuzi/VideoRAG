 Hey guys, what's going on? So welcome back to my channel. This is another Plank Hall update for all the plant lovers and addicts out there. This one is my holiday edition. That is because you all know Christmas is just around the corner and that means when you go into stores or nurseries you will often find some of these holiday plants and I was very excited to actually pick a few of them up because I'm not going to have a Christmas tree in my place this year and I figured I want to pick up some of these Christmas plants or holiday plants to obviously add to the home not only to my collection of plants but also to give this place a bit of Christmas spirit. So I'm very excited about it and I picked up about four different types of plants, two from my local grocery store and the other two from Walmart obviously the place to get your plants because trust me they have really really good ones at a very very reasonable price. But yeah, I'm excited to do this because I've never actually own some of these plants. One of them I do so I have own in the past and we'll get to that but let's start with the Christmas cactus. So this is a Christmas cactus and it is more of a tropical cactus rather than a desert cactus so you will often find these again in your local stores or nurseries around this time of the year because they produce the bloom or the buds when the days get shorter and the dates get cooler. So this one is thriving really well. The amount of flower buds on each of the green leaves anywhere from two sometimes three of them and when they bloom they look like that one. So a beautiful cactus that has flowers and you know what I like about this is that they come in different colors. You can get them in red or white. This one is I think fuchsia or pink but yeah it looks good and care tips for this particular plant is you want to make sure it is gets a lot of sunlight but not direct sunlight so you want to make sure it's a little bit filtered or indirect. You can let soil dry out before you water it. I prefer to keep it more on the moist side because again it is a tropical cactus versus more of a desert cactus right. So another great plant and I think I paid about I think this was ten dollars of my local grocery store. There was another smaller version but again I wanted one that was already pretty much ready to bloom so it adds some color into into the place. So this is a Christmas cactus. The next one I got at the same store is actually an amorellis. So this is an amorellis and I've never owned one before and this particular plant will shoot out a bud and bloom about four flowers it is one stem and it has the green foliage and this particular plant loves a lot of bright light so you can put this in direct sunlight and again the soil is more on the moderately moist side. Sometimes you can buy the bulbs and kind of plant that six or eight weeks ahead of the holiday season so you can't time it but this one pretty much I got it with the foliage and the bud but it hasn't bloom yet but you can tell it's starting to right start to open up right there. So I'm very excited to see how this is going to look and turn out and because of the length of it you know I'm going to put this on my island and when the flower blooms and I think it's going to add a pretty cool you know again color and life into my place during this holiday season. So amorellis you're going to find these often in your grocery stores kind of the entire Walmart they're everywhere be sure to grab one. This I think was only cost me about seven dollars they were having a sale for like three for twenty bucks but I didn't want to get all three so I just wanted one and then this was the perfect one because it had a great bud as well as the green foliage with it. So that is an amorellis and the next Christmas plant I got during this plant haul holiday edition is the point setta point setia. So I don't know how you guys pronounce this but for the longest time I used to think these were called point setta and then I just realized the other day that they're actually called point setia. I don't know if that's just a fancier way of saying it but you know when you do read the spelling it does I guess it should read and sound as it's spelled so it's point setia regardless whatever you want to call this plant it is a classic it is a traditional holiday Christmas plant that adds a lot of color and life to your place and it is beautiful and one of obviously my favorite holiday plants and I remember growing up never owning one and I used to always see them in movies and used to think that they were only for the rich and famous because they really add that you know very very beautiful look to your home but no this one I bought at Walmart for $4 so of course they are not for the rich and famous they are for anybody and everybody who loves these plants. The one thing about the point setta that I know I again I've owned one of these before that and what I think most people do is after the holidays and after the plants tend to you know like the leaf starts to fall off it's people throw them away and just garbage them but these plants you can actually keep all year long and similar to even the Christmas cactus as well too when the flower falls off you can keep that plant all year long throughout the summer spring and get it to also re-blume again and you can also do the same thing with this plant and as well I think with the amorellis so that's gonna be really interesting for me because I'm actually going to challenge myself to keep these guys until the following year and see if I can get them to re-bloom but yeah another classic holiday plant and this one yeah I think this is $4 a Walmart so there you go the other plant I got also Walmart which I think is kind of my favorite is the Norfolk Island Pine so this one's actually pretty cool because first of all the Norfolk Island Pine is not a pine tree or from the Pine family so you cannot throw these outside in the winter and have snow on it because it will die this is actually a tropical plant so it's a little bit deceiving right but it's a beautiful Christmas plant and in the wild these can actually grow really really big like 80 feet tall and whatnot inside the home they can probably grow you know five six feet but yeah I got this little guy for about ten dollars a Walmart I was actually a little upset because there was another Norfolk Island Pine at Walmart that was probably three times its size beautiful well full and lush and the only reason why I didn't pick it up is because I didn't have room in my car because I was running an errand and I was about to pick up my little cousins as well too so there's no room to put that big one in my car so I end up getting this little one but that's okay because the one thing about plants and the joy of owning one is watching them grow I know and I'm excited to watch this guy grow and again I'm going to keep this throughout the year and see how he's going to look by next Christmas but this one at Walmart they put a little bit of Christmas decoration on it you guys can kind of see there it's kind of cute and you know if you guys are looking for a gift for someone is actually a perfect gift because you can they have these you know two and from tags that they attach so it's a pretty cool Christmas gift I would actually give this to someone I would love it if someone gave this to me but that's okay I gave this to myself as my Christmas gift but yeah the North folk island pine again care tips for this bright light because it is a tropical plant you want to make sure the soil is moderately moist you never ever want to let this one dry out because the leaves would just fall off and yeah that's it that is my plan haul holiday edition Christmas edition whatever you guys want to call it like I said I'm very excited to have these in the home during this time of the year because I do think it just adds a lot of that Christmas spirit in my home right now on top of that just more plants to add to my collection and I think I'm more excited to actually care for them after the holidays and really challenge myself to keep these plants all year long so yeah hopefully you guys enjoy them and let me know if you guys have the same plant in your home right now or if you have different type of Christmas plants in your home because I know there are a few more out there like the holly plant or a mistletoe plant which I haven't seen yet in any stores but if I did I'm sure I would have grabbed those as well but yeah let me know what you guys think and hopefully you guys are having a great Thanksgiving because I know it is Thanksgiving right now as I'm recording this and it's probably going to be Thanksgiving when I publish this I live in Canada so it's not our Thanksgiving or Thanksgiving is was earlier in October so I know I know it's weird but yeah I'm hoping you guys have a great time with your family and enjoy that dinner peace hey guys hopefully you enjoy this video if you want to see more of my life make sure that you hit that guy up there and subscribe and if you want to see more plant updates and videos make sure you hit that playlist because there'll be a whole bunch of plant updates here that you guys hopefully enjoy it.
