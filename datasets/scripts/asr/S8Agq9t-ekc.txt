 We use 100% European breeds raising Colombia. This cattle is from the Normandy region and Northwest France, where one of the principal producers of this cattle breed are our countries like Belgium and Colombia. The first filter is made at this lotter house where we carefully selected raw skins. After raw skins are selected we started the production process. The raw hides are fledge and fat removed from the skin. Then in order to preserve the cow high we move onto tainy where skins are processed with crumb chemicals to eliminate any type of bacteria left on. After tainy processed the cow high are placed into the dry stage, where for period seven dates and an outdoor field all cow hides are stretched to reach the maximum length and not allow the skin to shrink. One of the cow high trade marks quality is the softness and brightness of a product which takes us to the next stage condition. Where all cow hides are reigned through the drug mill where skin oils are applied to reach for high standards of softness and brightness. The three-man process is one of the last stages to reach for quality product. Here we shape out the cow high in order to fit both of our clients needs. Makeup and detailing. This is our last quality check process where we make sure the final product is revised with ready fire brands for cuts. I could take away the feel and look of our quality product. Here is our final product. Hope you enjoy.
