 Gooseberry propagation, gooseberries are great shrubs for the shade or the sun. They're very easy to propagate through tip layering. You can start them by cuttings too, but it's a little bit more difficult. Tip layering is nice because it involves just a few moments of work and then the plant does rest of the work. You don't have to worry about watering or establishing something new. So all you do is bend the tip down to the ground and cover it with a rock. You can also bury sections of the stem, but I found with gooseberries they really like to tip layer. So all you just take the tip, put a rock on it, wait down and wait and it'll send up a new shoot when it's fully rooted. I'll show you one that worked. This is a black velvet gooseberry. I love these ones. Over around this bush there's a separate variety. This one's Jans Prairie, another really good gooseberry. And you can see where this stem comes down. And last year the tip got buried right there and it's sent up this new shoot and this new shoot. So I could even take this one, bend this one down again and just keep looping them out further and further. Just bury the tip. It's a super easy way to make new gooseberry plants.
