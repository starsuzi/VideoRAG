 Seven hells. It's summertime. Okay, so today's taste test is... Ba-da-da. Ba-da-da. Coke. Coca-Cola Vanilla. All right. Now, you might ask yourself, Isaac, what's on? Why is this such a big deal? Right? Well, Coca-Cola Vanilla has not been in Japan officially for 10 years now. Hold on. So damn noisy. But I was cooking and I made hamburgers trying to eat a little healthier. So instead of getting a pizza, I made my own hamburgers and almost burned out the apartment. That's why it's so cloudy in here. So I had to open up the window. But it's really noisy and it's very hot. There. All right. Back to the subject here. Coca-Cola Vanilla has not legally been... are officially been produced and made in Japan for 10 years. And now it's officially back. So I'm going to try it out for you guys. So let's go ahead and use my official... All these free McDonald's trips I was taking. You get the free Coca-Cola glass. Let us give it a shot. A little hungry. No, hold on. Let me try my burger first. No. Okay. Shhh. Now I heard rumor. Not rumor. One of my friends actually tried this already and said that there's no vanilla in here. So I'm going to find out for myself. Come by. Let me smell it first. It has. There's... He might be right. You can smell the vanilla. But it's not as strong as what I remember, Coke Vanilla being. Let's try. No. It's there. This is it. This is Coke Vanilla. Do my wine official tasting. No, I mean it's there. It definitely doesn't taste like Japanese Coke. But it definitely tastes like Japanese Vanilla Japanese Coke. I can't imagine how much more different the American version would be. Maybe something to do with the sugar, but I don't actually see what the problem is. Smells like vanilla. Tastes like vanilla Coke. Yeah. Tastes exactly like... Now I will say, what I remember going to Denys in America, or if you get over to counter soda fountain type of, where do you know they put the vanilla syrup. That's going to be a lot stronger. But from what I remember, the vanilla Coke, this was pretty much the way it tastes. Anything more would taste a little more flat, a little more white, I guess. Just creamier, creamier. So this is pretty much it. Vanilla Coke. I'll try it from the bottle here. Okay. There we go. Not that. Okay. I think I figured out what the problem was. For some whatever reason, drinking it straight from the bottle, with your curved mouth, or whatever, or aerodon dynamics of the way it's inserted into your mouth, tastes a little different. So you can't exactly get that hit of vanilla, as much as more flat mouth, style-wide mouth style. Yeah, that's exactly it. That's it. That is weird. Huh. A very subtle but very noticeable change. Huh. Well, there you go. That's my recommendation. Coke vanilla? Okay. In a glass only. And maybe you need a particular Coca-Cola glass in order to enjoy it properly. Please drink responsibly. Happy summer, yo. Let's continue.
