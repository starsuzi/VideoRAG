 I thought I'd do a quick video of a new insect hotel but I've just completed sort of sparing off from the large one that I posted a video about last year which has been really successful. As you can see there's solitary bees all over it. I think they are torny mining bees but this one what I've done is use about ten different holes ranging from about two and a half mil up to the biggest switch I think is about 14 it could be 14 or 15 mil and I thought I'd clump the holes together rather than what I usually do which is sort of randomly put them over the wood because this will allow me to see exactly which holes are most successful and hopefully if one of the bees visits and he finds a hole that but it's filled then he can quickly find one adjacent to it and that nice bit of an experiment really but it seems to be really good as you can see there's bees all over it so I'm really pleased but I'll let you know later in the year how they all did but I'm pretty hopeful for this one I think it's gonna do well.
