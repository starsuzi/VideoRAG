 I noticed the local ASDA which is a UK chain of stores that's owned by Walmart was selling and really pushing these Uni Bond 80360 pure moisture absorber units and the way they're presenting the packaging is as a full-blown home-deaf midifier so it looks the part it's you know it's got all these swirly high-tech things about it that fit features and rather misleadingly it says more water and quicker for a stop within 12 hours which will bloom well hope so for a dehumidifier but it says effective for one to three months in a 20 square meter room that's very misleading but anyway let's say take a look at the principle of this so here is a typical one of these chemical dehumidifiers and I regard these more as a scientific curiosity and anything else so what we've got here is we've got a plastic container and on the top there's a foil seal and when you pull the foil seal off it will reveal these pellets inside the pellets are generally calcium chloride and the thing about calcium chloride is it's extremely hydroscopic it really sucks moisture out the ear and when you actually peel this off it's got a membrane to stop it all pouring out ear is now going to permeate that membrane it's going to be absorbed into these crystals in here and then there's a sort of grid that the moisture can go through and as the crystals absorb moisture they gradually get wet and wet until they physically drip through and form a liquid and it gives them pressure that you know it has take a lot of water out there I mean it has taken some water out there but you see it fill up with liquid and it you know it looks like it's done their job however these aren't really suited to small spaces and you have to consider various things like this the calcium chloride once it's wet well even as a dry is extremely corrosive it's a fairly caustic material and if you had metal objects in the vicinity and this fell over and spilled on them then the not when they would you end up with a very moisture absorbent surface if this soaked into wood or into that then it would just you know be permanently dampened absorb moisture all the time but any metal working with a Cindy would corrode because this this is very corrosive so let's take a look at the unibond version of this so here's the swirly bits for the 360 degree action and inside this lockable container with that emitting spout you get this big block and the idea of the block is let's open this up probably you're not supposed to handle it because it is quite caustic the idea of the block is that ear can circulate all around it you know it's suspended in the middle like this and then ear can circulate and it will gradually just dissolve away until it drops into the tree so let's take a look at the loading system for this you press this button at the top and it hinges down you put the block in not sure which we around you put the block I'll guess it's blue side down it could be wrong and then you hinge it back up and that's it in position and that will then start absorbing moisture the ear the way they imply in the box is that you know the ear is circulating around it and it's got some terrible action when in reality the only real advantage of this one over that this other one is that this one's got the membrane which will effectively reduce the ability to absorb moisture quickly this one is just going to have a natural ear flow through it it's going to be more exposed to that and as this block dissolves it will then drip down into a tree and through this they have made at least some efforts to try and stop it from spilling with this sort of tightly fitting container and the clips but here's the thing if this does last for as they say one to three months was it one to three months let's see what it says in the box yet one to three months in a 20 square meter room 20 square meters is quite a big room and typically with an electric dehumidifier with a standard dehumidifier I would expect that to pull out in a you know depending on the human team the room if there was a humidity issue in the first place then it would be pulling a lot out but certainly a nine-leaf man my dehumidifiers pull out typically the main one in the house pulls out two liters a day two liters of liquid and the one in my bedroom which is just typically keeps a place at 60% humidity that requires emptied round about this time of year maybe every three days so it draws about two liters out every three days and that's it and it's low setting this over the course of the time it says last one to three months will draw out approximately well this only goes up to one liter and that one liter will also have to include the mass of this thing which is dissolved in the water so this thing might be usable for a small cupboard if you didn't have anything that was liable to corrosion in it you know if there was nothing really critical but for whole room dehumidification if you actually want that done properly the only thing that's going to do that is an actual proper room dehumidifier these things are little more than a scientific curiosity and also once you've actually once it's completely drained down and you're pouring this I guess you know the calcium chloride isn't that super harmful to the environment it's no worse than ordinary salt you know concentrated salt solution but you are pouring basically a saturated chemical solution down your drain when you get rid of this which is you know it's not necessarily a great thing so yeah the literature that comes with this is just very deceiving it does it's trying to sell it as a proper whole house dehumidifier type thing when it really isn't it's just a small cupboard dehumidifier if that
