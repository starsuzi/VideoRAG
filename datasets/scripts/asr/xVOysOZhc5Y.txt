Incredible slippery. Well, the point is never pull it backwards. They all have to push forward. And all use this if you've got the view of the other. Otherwise, if this gets stuck in there, it's gonna cause more problems than you've got in the beginning. So keep that in mind. And then I'm just gonna push forward in the middle of the forest.

Okay, I'm gonna clean it all the way. There, it's clean. Okay, so here's the job well done. We have cleaned actually all the way to the house. And inside. It's coming out here.
