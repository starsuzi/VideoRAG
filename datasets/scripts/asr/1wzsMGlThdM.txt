 Welcome to this Nespresso Assistance video on cleaning your Nespresso VirtuaLine Evaluo machine. In order to create a perfect cup of coffee, time after time, we recommend that you follow these simple instructions.

We recommend that you regularly empty the capsule container and drip tray in order to avoid overflowing.
