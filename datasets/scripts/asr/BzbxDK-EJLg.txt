 Hey guys, Happy Hour Special episode! We made this! What is this? This is called the jailbird. Woo! Yeah, it's Bruno. But we fancyed it up a little bit. That would clap it up. Yeah, what you want? You want it? Yeah, get it. You're gonna get it. One, two, three, four. This is the show where we make drinks and drinks. Take desert and kids and everything. Take it and cook it and cook it and drink it. And that would be a thing. But we're only good friends. So Bruno is a fruit wine that you make in jail. People in jail make this because you're not allowed to have alcohol in there. So you make a crude mixture of sugars and yeast and hope that it comes out with an alcoholic beverage. We got oranges, we got canned fruit, we got old bread, sugar, ketchup and water. Okay? And you need a ziplock bag or a trash bag or whatever you need. What we're gonna do is we're gonna crudely combine this real quick. You see, just the whole can of peaches. We put it in a bag and we're going to squeeze that, get all those juices going. We're trying to release as much liquid as we can from the fruit. Any liquid that you can release, that is going to turn into booze, drinkable booze for you. Oh yeah, thanks, thank you, thank you, thank you. You know, we would be the best prison mates together, you know what I'm saying? You get the top bunk, I get bottom bunk, you know what I'm saying? We decorate it all nice. I feel like a vacation. I got your bag, you got my bag. Yeah, definitely man. We got to protect each other. Yeah. Because we're too pretty. Moving on, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I'm saying. Looking at my soft ass mouth. If it was just one of us, we'd be in trouble. I'd be someone's girlfriend real quick. Okay. It's chunky. But you know, most of the liquid has been released from the fruit. This is how this works. So we open this back up. And what we're going to do is we're going to take this old ass piece of bread, okay, with some sugar on it. And we're just going to tear it up, we'll put it in here. And the thought process behind this is that the old bread has like fun goals in it, okay? So we're just going to break that up, crudely put that in there. We're going to take some ketchup. This one, this step I don't understand actually. But everywhere you look, they tell you to put ketchup in it. And this is about two and a half cups of sugar, okay? We're going to put that in here. See? So what you should end up is something like this. And we're going to add two cups of water, finally. Let's mix this up. After a week, you should end up with something that looks like this. And if you notice, there's floating white particles in there, okay? So I want to say that's the yeast slash the fungus. And it doesn't look pleasant. I'm not going to lie. And somehow bugs just formed inside of the bag. I don't know how they got in there, okay? And so you need to take the time to filter it out so you get a nice clean liquid. How do you filter it? It's filtered through a sock. This is actually my sock. I boiled it in water just because I thought I should probably do that. So we have this glass. We're going to take this hot sock. Oh, it's hot. Take this hot sock and put it over the top. Man, like so. So what we're going to do is we're going to take this greeno. Take a whiff of that nose. Oh, man. That nose. Woo! That nose is, that means it's good. That means it's good. I mean, you did a good job. So we're going to pour this through my hot sock and hopefully this filter's out all the chunks. Oh, slow down there. It's good that we filter it. We need the purest pruno that we can have. This sock is turgid with liquid right now. Let's not take the time to filter it all out. We're just going to say that's good enough. That's good enough. If I made pruno, I'm giving it some other fuckers who I'm afraid of. This is like, rate me here. Take this booze. That might invite them to rate me, though, too. Because they're like, you're so nice. You're so nice. Your pruno is top shelf. Top shelf. Top that ass. Taste wise, that's not bad. Let's have a taste. You end up with something like this. It looks like a cloudy lemonade. Let's have a taste here. Pop up. The nose. The nose is like ketchup. It kind of smells like stale farts. Let's have it. Honestly, that's not bad. Right? All right. Off putting on the nose. Right. But, you could drink this. And, oh, this was made in a ziplock bag and put through one of Dennis' socks. I would not believe you. So, let's serve this properly. Okay, so we have this drink here. Let's make it nice and cool so we take some ice. We're going to throw in the bad boy here. So, you know what? Let's, we're just going to bitter it up a little bit. Pop, pop. Okay, let's see how this turns out. Oh, this is a little pale pink. Brown type of thing going on. Even in jail, you got to keep it, you got to keep it good. That is pretty good. I'm not like super into it. I don't know, it's not that bad. I don't know if I could pay $10 for this. You pay $10 for this? I might prune myself. I think it just needs like a lot of whiskey, you know? I think we just top it off with whiskey, you know, just fill with whiskey. It kind of tastes like a cheap old fashioned. It's like prune, all right? This is like gourmet prune. I did it good. I filtered it through a nice, sanitary sock. It's my sock too. Like, it's my essence in it. And that's the only essence I would like to know. I like how you smell. You walk in a room and I'm like, oh, is Dennis here? I feel the same way, by the way. Because I can smell you. I feel the same way. But like, I think it's deeper than that too, the little bit. It's like, it's not even just this... You know, I like what you did with the whiskey there. Yeah, it tasted a lot like whiskey. That's what I liked about it. It's a good quality. Here's our cocktail now. First, you're going to take a prune out and you're going to pour it into your mixing tin. How much doesn't matter? You're in jail, all right? You don't measure stuff when you're in jail. Uh-uh. The two busy being raped. A gym beam? Next. Would you find this in jail now? If you got like that Morgan Freeman character from Shawshank, maybe you get yourself some gym beam. Well, I don't know if the dude is married, but if he isn't, he is knee deep in poo. I would pay to hear Morgan Freeman say dirty things to me. Oh, you like that? I'll put it in you. I pay like 10 bucks just to hear him say those two statements. We'll look that up on the internet. I feel like that might exist. Angus store bitters. Two dashes of that bitch. Okay, this is that same crappy pink. You can eat though that garnish in there. You know, you gotta like, fuck it, two cherries. Yeah, two cherries. Blah blah. All right, blah blah, look at that right there. Mmm, that's not bad. It's not though. No, but sex, tenement. Like who's going to get it? Yeah. Oh, I don't know. Am I going to get it? Are you going to get it? No, maybe I give. Maybe I'll take it. I don't know. Maybe we wrestle until somebody gives up. One, two, three, four. Hey guys, happy hour special episode. We made Bruno. This dude made cocktails with it, right? This cocktail right here is called the key. The jailbird. It's nice. You know, jailbird, three, you're not free. Get fucked in the butt, whatever.
