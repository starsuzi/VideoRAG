 Today we are going to make a Neuron's desk. For that we need one CD which is no off use. Then we need a hard paper. You can make it easily by pasting 3 or 4 A4 Planck A4. After doing that you need a double tape, a moral and a battery and a holder. Two thermo-coil pieces, one rod, one narrow. Now we will learn how to make a Neuron's desk. For that first you have to take the hard paper and the CD. After doing that take the CD on the hard paper and trace it like that. After tracing this we need a scissors. So we will cut this and it will look like that. After doing this you have to divide it into 7 parts. Now you have to fill it with the colors of the rainbow like red, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow. After doing that you have to paste it on a CD. Then you have a thing like that which is very hard. After doing that you need the two corouts of the thermo-coil. You have to paste it by a double tape and then we have a base. After doing that we need the battery and put the holder on it. After doing that we need a motor and paste it on the top of the narrow piece. This we are going to do by a double tape. After that we need a regular tape for support. We will make it a support. Then it will not move from a position and let it let the Newton's desk move. Then we have to join it with a paper, folded paper and we have to try the paper with the disk. This will make the set complete. After that we need a device, a negative and a positive. We have to connect the negative with one terminal of the remote and the positive with yellow. When we do that it will be your Newton desk. Thank you for watching.
