 So this video will help you find so this video mostly will help you find a bad brake line as opposed to the other brake components on your car if your pedal is going soft and going to the floor and you think you might have a little leak in a brake line but you can't find it here's what you can do with the engine off press the brake pedal as hard as you can you might feel something all of a sudden give way or the pedal will just slowly go to the floor or it will just hold pressure in this case it's slowly going to the floor that's at the floor so when that happens you know there's a leak somewhere and and one of the brake lines or components gave way in this case you'll definitely be able to see where the fluid is coming from because it's gonna spray out of there and if it's just a little pinhole it will leak enough fluid for you to see it so I've already located the leak just to make it easy for this video so you can see already on the cardboard there's fluid and and that is where my leak is coming from so I'm gonna have to replace that brake line it goes under the gas tank and the exhaust and everything goes to the passenger side rear wheel so that's gonna be fun and you don't need to worry about damaging anything on your braking system by pressing the pedal as hard as you can with the engine off because if something gives way it was too weak to be a part of your braking system in the first place and it needs to be replaced I used this method on my 89 Ford F250 to find all of the brake leaks and when a brake line pops it's an interesting feeling pedal is pressing all of a sudden it goes so if this video helped you give it a thumbs up if you like the video subscribe for more and thanks for watching I also want to do a quick shout out for Carla this is a OBD2 GPS tracker you can track where your vehicle is via an app on your phone I can't actually use this because it needs iOS 8 or newer and I still using this antique device yeah you can track your vehicles whether it's your personal vehicle your kids vehicle your employees vehicle you can you monitor acceleration hard braking sharp cornering and it even gives the driver a monthly safety score this thing will actually alert your phone when your vehicles moved when the engine starts if unusual vibration is detected and even if the device is disconnected it'll also monitor your battery and let you know in advance if the battery is low etc I actually read an Amazon review where a guy got a US an OBD2 extension cable and bug one end into the car lock and the other end into his wife's car and like hit the car lock way up in the dash and he caught her cheating on him ultimately so here's the device very nice comes with owners manuals and stuff like that and it'll come with a activation code for your app I wish I could show it to you in action but like I said I can't use the thing so thank you for watching go check it out further on Amazon and let me know what you think of it
