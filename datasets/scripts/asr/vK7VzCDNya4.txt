 Hi there, my name is Dolores Venobogard and I'm a Norwek Independent Sales Consultant and I'm going to show you today how you can maintain a plexiglass shower, stall, door, or glass shower door. Anything that is enclosed inside the shower including the tile or the acrylic with the scaler, this stuff is absolutely fantastic for removing lime, rust, and hard water build up. I'm going to spray it on the surface and we're going to let it sit for five minutes. I'm going to first start with spraying it on. Helps you open it. Now if it's heavily soiled, you're going to want to let it sit on for five minutes for the first application. And if you maintain your shower stall by wiping it down with an enviral cloth after each shower, you will never get a build up like this on it. Now this is an acreage shower and acreages are known to have very, very hard water which puts a very difficult build up on the shower stall. Now once again, you don't have to be worried about it being toxic. Usually you would let the sit on for five minutes, but I'm going to just start rubbing it right away with my bathroom scrub mitt which is scrubby on one side and it's actually soft and fluffy on the other side. Just to give it a little help along, I'm just going to rub on it. I think if you can see what I can see from my side, the stuff is already working amazing. I can feel the difference as I rub over it. How all the hard water build up is coming off. I see there's some hair sprayer such on the other side. I'm going to give that a bit of a rub as well. Now I'm going to take my enviral cloth and I'm actually going to go over it with my enviral cloth. Then I'll polish this side. Look at that. What a difference. All the hard water is off. Totally clean. If you already have a Norwex consultant, I'm sure you're being very well taken care of. But if you are not familiar with Norwex's products, feel free to send me an email. Have a great day.
