Thank you so much for a new to you who leave me this awesome comment and I dedicate this video to you and this is Kiki showing you up while we're gonna do. So I'm starting with a post-a-board I got this post-a-board at the dollar store I think it's two for a dollar or like 59 cents or something like that and I'm marking both sides and making the strips of three to four inches I think three inches is better but you can decide what you want between three and four depends how big or how little your baby that the kids and you're making for the party is but three inches are perfect that's my the one that I like the most and I think you can get a kind of like ten heads and each post-a-board so it's not an expensive decoration it's not an expensive party favor if you want to give as of course if you decide to do this for your party please have one for each child you know so you don't have a problem and one is crying because they don't have it or they have it things like that and they're probably gonna take home so make it and think then you're not gonna see it again as a party favor so I'm gonna cut all the stripes for the hat and you can make as many as you want you can even I don't know like you can use another like a harder paper if you want but I think post-a-board is the perfect paper for that because it's not too thick then it's gonna you know be around the head and it's gonna fold it very easy and bend it very easy so this is a great one so with the pen I'm just gonna mark the eyes you can cut that and then you cut a machine like a creakier silhouette if you want to to even make it then even perfect or make it template to make them they exactly the same but I'm just gonna draw by hand and you know any unicorns unique so they are not exactly the same but if I was making for selling I will probably make it simply or cut it on my cricket so now the same tissue paper then I'm using for all those unicorn party stuff I know you guys must be bored to see unicorn but I made so many cool things when I was helping the party then I wanted to show you guys so I got one each color of my tissue paper that comes all together and I'm folded in half and I'm gonna fold it again and now we're gonna fold it all the way around and we're gonna have one side then it's folded in half then doesn't have open it and the bottom side heads open it and that's the bottom side then you're gonna cut it and we're gonna go leaving two like fingers at the top and we're gonna cut all little stripes then that's making the hair from the tail then we're gonna put it on the hat so you don't need to worry about where measure this just cut it by you know by eyes but just leave the two fingers on the top so now we're gonna open it again and then we're gonna cut in half so that is gonna be like two big pieces then you can cut it and we're gonna start preparing to put in the hat so now two fingers I will cut it one two fingers cut it one two fingers cut it one and that's gonna be the little sat for each of the head I do that because I like to have each color but if you want to just do pink or just do blue you can do that too but since my unicorn party everything was with this pastel colors and everything had all the colors together kind of rainbrush that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna fold it and staple to be sure that this is not gonna move around or I'm gonna lose colors and that's gonna be like a two-show hair you know like a tail so we're gonna staple all them so now I have the part that we draw the eyes on the back and one side we're gonna staple this you want to put in the back because you want this to be inside the head not outside so you don't see it and then when you're gonna put in the hat you're just gonna fold it and staple the back you can even leave a staple in or the party so people can do as that to the side they need this is the years and I made it I cut it the cricket so if you guys want to have that design so if you have a cricket you want to cut it just let me know I totally sent for you and you can cut this by hand the flower I have the video and you can the rest cut it by hand thank you kicking for modeling my hats that were very cute and the kids really really like it and you can use any little flowers paper flower than you want or you know hearts whatever you want please don't forget subscribe my channel if you haven't yet and I talk to you guys on the next video bye
