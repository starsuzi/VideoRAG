 This week on the produce nerd we're going to take you behind the scenes of a dried fake harvesting operation. Once all of the fresh fake harvests have passed the figs that are left on the trees dry out. At the start of the dried fig season large 10 to 12 foot fans are brought into the field to blow the figs off of the trees. However as the season progresses the dried figs will drop to the ground on their own. Once the figs drop to the ground there is a sweeper that goes through the field and sweeps all of the dried figs into a pile. As you see here the sweeper gathers everything that is on the ground including leaves can sticks. After a few days there is a machine that drives through the rows and picks up all of the piles. The machine is able to sort out most of the debris from the ground which blows out the side of the machine. All the dried figs go up to wooden benches that are located on the back of the machine. Once the bins have been filled they are stacked at the edge of the old where a trap comes and transports them to a sorting facility. The harvested dried figs are then further sorted to remove any additional field debris and the fruit that does not meet customer specifications. Prior to sending the fruit to a dried fake packing and processing operation. Thank you for watching. Please subscribe to the produce nerd.com where a new blog will be posted every Tuesday.
