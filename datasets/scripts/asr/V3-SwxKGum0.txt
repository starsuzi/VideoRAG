 Braising refers to cooking meat slowly at low heat in a small amount of liquid after browning it on all sides in fatter oil. To start, season the pieces of meat with salt and pepper. In a heavy bottomed stew pan, brown the pieces in very hot oil and remove them. Then lightly brown an aromatic garnish in the hot oil for a few minutes and lower the heat. Place the pieces of meat back in the stew pan and add a small amount of broth. Depending on the type of braised meat, you can also cook it in water, meat juices, stock, red wine or chopped tomatoes. Now add a bouquet gal ni. Cover the stew pan and cook at very low temperature until the meat is tender for about 2 hours depending on the piece of meat. Longer braising in a covered stew pan produces thick flavorful gravy.
