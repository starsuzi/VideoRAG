 Hey, so welcome back. I had to take a day off and I've come back and I wanted to show you that I did get quite a nice little pre-polish is what I call it. Anything before I get to 600 I like to call it pre-polishing. So you can see it's pretty spectacular piece. This is dry. I'll just get it wet here. You can see that it's gonna have some really fun play inside the the agate itself. It says like pretty spectacular colors and green crystal whites and blues. So it's got azaret malchide in it. I got it out of a area that's pretty known for its copper mines. So you can see that. I want to see the finished product. Just go to Chaos Rock and Jury and I'll have that posted as soon as I get it finished. So I hope you enjoyed these videos and I hope you learned something and I just I thank you all for for listening to me and if you have any questions, comments, concerns, put them in the comments, subscribe and go check out my page Chaos Rock and Jury. Thanks!
