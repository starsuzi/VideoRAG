 Today I'm about to show you how to take off a car window decal. Okay, it's fairly simple. Just get some window cleaner like some windex. So, we need to fix. Alright, so you spray this shit on here. You need to take a razor blade. You can just scrape it off. No, it's not going to be a glass. Nope. As long as you keep it wet. It'll work great and won't scratch a window. Keep it moist. See that? It's coming off fairly simple. And this is an old decal too. It works on new decals, old decals, and if you got glue left over, it'll take that off too. Real simple. Hope you enjoyed the video.
