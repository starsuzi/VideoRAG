 Hi everybody, this is the Little Bubba cement landscaping curb machine. It's going to do some magic here in our yard and this video is going to show you exactly what it took to get it done. You'll see we've already prepared everything, leveled it out, removed some landscape rocking and things that were in place and everything is marked off where we want the curves to be poured. So as we come around this curve, you'll see the guys at work here in the front yard already and they're actually going to do this side, the other side and the back yard. So here they are, we've got obviously the sound muted so I could do a voice over here and just tell you a little bit about it. It does about a foot, a minute and it's a two-man job. Obviously they mix up their mortar, one guy's shoveling, another guy's driving the machine around. Following the curve that they've spray painted on the lawn and it took four hours to do 175 linear feet pretty fast. So let's see how this works. Here we go. Okay, so there's the final curve. You'll notice we've got a few plants in place but we're definitely not finished yet. Curve turned out very well. You'll notice they're able to do some pretty sharp curves there and when it comes down to meeting up with a sidewalk or driveway, stop it down so it's not just a big abrupt ending to the curve. So we're pretty happy with it. I was very interested to see all this get done. Again, four hours, 175 feet is laid in place. Great we're happy. Hope you enjoyed the video. Thanks for watching.
