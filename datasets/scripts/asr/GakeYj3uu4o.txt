It smells really good. I'm glad you just did it for me. I think they just made the giants, the world's largest sucker. Oh yeah! That's a huge. Yummy. What kind of vegan that is? So do you know what a granite is? What? Nope. So it absorbs the heat. So what's going to happen? It's very average. Alright so the makeup and the face color. What do you think Audrey? Is that your face? Oh it's pretty good. It's a lot to say. Oh, it's a little orange. Oh, it's a little orange. Oh, it's a little orange. A little orange. Audrey. What is going on? So what is in the house? I am so confused. It doesn't have a good blood. Oh, it's a good blood. What? We just have to pack and get it. And then, and now we need to take it all up to the part of the table. Pull it down. We need it more. Wow. It's so bright. It's magic. I would have told you this was better. I would have told you this was better. This is no one to pull it down too much. That's why I'm taking it to the heat and save it right now. So it's a heat and to 75 Celsius degrees. You need to have a feel. Who's the type of heat? Oh, you know what we call it. Oh, no. So it's a long, turn-in flair. And can't even fucking save it. So, what's the bottom? It's nice and soft. And it's like a four-foot. It's like a four-foot. It's like a four-foot. So it happens. So it happens. And that's it. Oh, my God. It's a nice, bright, bright color. So we just need to fold this. We have the same consistency as the C-F-4. It's excited. Me! It's filling our artistic. I don't know. I'm worried that I'll mess up. I am not artist. Oh. Hey, if you're going to paint this canvas, you better be accurate. Nice. All right, we'll paint mom's. I'm trying to paint Jordan as Buddy B-L. Oh, no. She has a picture too. I'm going to paint the Elsa. Okay, now we start making demonstration. How do we make places? I'm going to try to make a dress like this. Cool. Absolutely. I still want to make a mirror. I could use too many colors. That's why I'm just going to make a smaller version of the face. So with this white, which looks really good to do something to make a lighter. And more white also from the body. Same what you do with it to make the lighter. When you mix, when you stretch, actually, you add the rubber swirls to make it more slacking light. So I'm just going to make those do it to your trans. The scrum's thin. That's your style. The slime swirl guys. Jordan, you should be very good at this. Yes. And just doing it with the pads. But if we have bigger batches making props for example of body props, we just give it a bit and just set it over there on the wall. And it's stretcher like that. Oh, okay. It's kind of challenging. So if we work out anything up to 14 kilos. So this is just a 60-way batch, so you can measure it from 14 kilos. But this is just like a 1 kilo white. And you do this change of texture. All right, now, rock, clean it. Wow. The facial's going to show us how to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. It's a special. If you change my mind, I'm going to make a nail. You're going to make a nail. I'm going to make a nail. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to make a nail like that. And we're doing the bridges of the nails as well. You want to make sure that we're pushing up. So we're getting a higher degree of, now we're just going to do the knots real quick. So you want to dig in two poles. And then using each knots real quick, we're going to slow it up. Stick in, and pull up and out. It's a great nail knot. What do you think? I'm worried. I'm worried. Okay, so that piece of candy can have a talk bat. We're going to see my kitchen. This is hot. Yes. It's not a fashion allergic. It's a fashion allergic. Oh, I love honey. I love honey. I love honey. It's a good one. No, it's just from a builder's face. I think that the face is more key in hands now. But it can work and have a neat better than this. I'm not a model. So yeah, we need to cool it down because it's still quite hot. So I'm just going to place it on the cooling wall. And your cooling tables are only in the wall, so yeah. So before you get to start, I'm going to tell you a few things. On the table, imagine what I'm going to be bringing around the locks. They'll be brought in the locks and the locks. Okay, so that's three. I'm going to make our masterpieces. Okay. The tape. You ready for this? I got one of those, but it's just like slime. Yeah.
