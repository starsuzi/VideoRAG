 If you're grabbing your cheeses out of the refrigerator, serving them cold and putting them on a board with a bunch of other cheeses, you're doing it all wrong. One thing I see all the time that people do wrong is they serve their cheese cold. Well, what's the point of doing that? If it's straight out of the fridge, you can't even taste it. People often put too many cheeses on one cheese board, and if you crowd the cheeses, then you can't cut them. Cutting the cheese in cubes before serving it, it dries the cheese out and it looks like a deli platter. Probably the most annoying, not to mention rude thing that people do wrong is they dig the center out of a cheese and leave the rind behind. Now I'm going to show you the right way to serve and cut cheese. First of all, you want to serve your cheeses at room temperature. Not only do they taste better, but it makes it easier for you if you take the cheeses out an hour before you serve them. They'll be at the right temperature and you don't have to worry about the cheeses at the last minute. Not everybody likes strong cheeses. If you have a blue cheese or another type of strong cheese, put it on its own platter. It's really important to preserve the shape of a cheese. Don't cut off the tip. Instead, cut slices that are the same direction or shape of the wedge that you're serving. You also want to make sure that you serve a different knife with each cheese. If you use one knife, all the cheeses are going to start tasting the same. If you do all these things correctly, then you're going to be treating your cheese and your guess right.
