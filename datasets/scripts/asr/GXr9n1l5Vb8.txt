 Hello everybody! So today we're going to be doing um how to make fake poop um but this is I don't really like it I don't like it at all but um I've gotten requests and stuff of how to do it and this is basically how my grandmother made it and it's just okay but um yeah and today I have my cousin Kaylee with me and um she recently just made a YouTube channel so go follow it it's Kaylee's world so yeah let's get started so basically all you really need is these many things and you just need some extra chunky peanut butter or just chunky did you use extra chunky okay she's a chunky um they just need creamy and you're totally totally and I have some butter paper so first we're just gonna start off with the peanut fire so it's gonna have some peanut butter yeah and depending on you know how much you want is how much you kind of put in what you do babe it's peanut butter here we go okay I'm dehydrated okay so then you're just going to mix it I'm not gonna do a lot I mean that's don't forget if it's you're gonna use it for a baby babies don't poop that much I know but like it looks really dark well okay and you know I hate to say it but some poop's range and okay sorry yeah that's better yeah I know that I'm still gonna need it it's peanut butter and Nutella this is what I need on a regular day it's very tasty if it just it just looks like it it doesn't mean like it's actual poop it's Nutella and peanut butter okay so now we're gonna add in the crunchy peanut butter or extra crunchy if you want to get a little bit more mushy you can just put it in the microwave but we're not really gonna do that because you should if you're going if you want to make a little bit more like mushy and softened stuff you have to probably just put in the microwave for like at least three seconds but yeah because if you put it for like 10 or something you'll just get like mushy kind of like watery you don't like crunchy I don't like crunchy peanut butter I don't like peanuts Uncle Mat loves crunchy that's why and like Celeste much crunchy muchy crunchy many more um still like really liquidy no maybe just like oh yeah if he that adds a little bit of substance to it that's that's pretty much it and then you kind of what I did for when I tricked right that day was just put a little in the bottom of the diaper and and this is what I should do it do we have a libyus in there oh yeah liby's there liby is there I'm not eating it from the diaper oh no yeah and then there you go it's really heavy I see you opened it up again so we can see what it looks like inside that looks like a poopy diaper me and my husband has changed quite a few of those in my time yeah okay but um yeah that was kind of it for this video and um Kaylee is going to do it for her people um but yeah so go subscribe to our channel Kaylee's world and we're gonna actually make a few more videos see you on the link in the description oh hashtag with the day because I'm such a slacker I like my fifth grade teacher okay um you all said this like okay oh yeah hashtag with the day is poopy diaper nasty no nasty poopy diaper okay oh yeah so bye guys
