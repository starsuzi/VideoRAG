 Okay, I'll show you a new way I figured out the girl ginseng seeds Called a pattern a natural occurrence Now last year I came up with this idea and we had 49% germination And we tried it in the woods and we're gonna try it in the pots again this year Just because I got a few seeds left. I want to just go ahead and have some extra plants. I know it a girl You can get started out with good quality seed We'll just take a put seed in the pot right on top of soil One seed per pot You can plant too if you want then you got two plants grown real close together better to have them separated All this is done outside I Talk about it in my book I wrote and that's he's not Finding another good seed Name of my book it's called it's for them Native plant conservation by following the pattern and natural currents It's available through eBay I got it on eBay or you can go through American botanicals in the Eola, Missouri EOLIA American botanicals they get copies of the book there. I'll talk about that Kinesha golden sill Aristocolia, which is for genus make root a really neat Process on that plant and the ginseng And what I did here was this is just a feet-based potting mix mixed up with a rodent cedar tree needles and We just cover it up cover the seeds up and what you want on this mix is it you want something that won't crust over Here we notice like a garden soil crust over and green beans won't come up through it Same process with ginseng if it crust over that ginseng seed will not push up through there and Also a heavy leaf cover the seed won't come up You know had to be pretty all right and get the seeds planted you watered in watch the water go right through that compost That's what you want Just like it does in a good part of the woods so right into the soil Get them good and wet It's simple we cover it with scrap plywood or any kind of wood you got It's simple And check them out through the winter make sure they're not dried out Sometimes if they're uneven the box of float off like this part here's a little Little water just keep that wood wet And that's it Come springtime keep checking him just look and check him see if any seed coming up And you'll see it and his first time you see any seeds coming up take off all the wood and and keep them moist and no grow And I actually they'll keep growing Here's some plants from last spring of 2013 these came up at just the first part of May I've described in my book and I kept them watered all summer long. I got hundreds of them Now if you leave these flats sitting on the ground they will go they will grow to the ground So it's important to move them and and plan them These I'm leaving them in the pots for a reason and when you do plan them You don't like break that block of dirt apart and see that the soil Is on there I put a little rotten leaves at the bottom so the soil won't wash out the soil and the mix at the top Now inside there's a root ball You can plant that in the woods and it will grow Thanks for watching and get a copy of my book. It's for them on eBay or at American Botanicals Thank you
