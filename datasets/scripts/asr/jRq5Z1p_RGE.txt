 Hey guys, I'm gonna show you a quick video about how to make sun tea. This is the tea that I'm drinking right now and it's just tea and water and a little bit of lemon and liquid sevia. This is the sweetener that I use. I usually use four drops per container of tea. A little bit more if I'm adding more lemons so it's not so long. Better. So here is my large ball jar. This holds four cups of water. So I'm gonna add four tea bags. The flavor that I'm making this time is Hibskis Pineapple Leechy. This is what's left over from my farmer's market last year. I had a lemonade, an iced tea and popcorn stand. So I'm just putting in filtered water and I put it all the way up to the top. I'm not gonna make you stare at that. But just for the sake of the video, I'm gonna cap it and put it out on my porch. Whoa! And there it is. I'm gonna let it sit all day in the sun. It usually sits about anywhere between eight to twelve hours. And it'll sit there and brew the tea and I'll enjoy that for most of the week. That's it! Thanks!
