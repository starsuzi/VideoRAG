 I just woke up and I'm in the mood for some sunny side of eggs. What's going on YouTube is Asia Finale back with another special video. Today I'm going to show you guys how to make the perfect sunny side of eggs. What you need is a big old white onion and some eggs. I'm going to put in some salt and pepper later. The biggest one is the egg you want. I'm going to go for the biggest one which is right in the middle. You can do this cut the brain. Like that. So I'll be using the outer most in the second biggest one. Simple like that. You skill it on high. Put some oil in there. Any type of oil that you want. I'm going to put my rings of onions. I'll be making two eggs. It's facing like that. I'm going to carefully put my eggs in there. There you go. That's one perfect sunny side of eggs. You can find them in the works. Here's the other one. Just don't leave it cooked like that. For about, I would say about a minute. Put some salt. Black pepper. We see how it turns out. Here you go. It's done. If there's any spillage, just remove it and skill it. It's a perfect brown shaped sunny side of eggs. Let's see how it turns out. Let's take a look at what the back looks like. Oh, that's a good texture I'm looking for. There is that running sunny side of eggs. I'm going to eat it with the onion. And yes, I know. Not everybody's going to like onion. So we'll see how to remove it. But first, let me try this piece right here. Yeah. sunny side up. Mmm. Delicious. Now, see how easy it is to remove the onion for those of you that don't like onion. See, it's simple like that. You just peel off like that. Try this piece. Oh, man. I think it's easier than this. Mmm. I love it. I'm going to scale 100% right there. Thanks for watching.
