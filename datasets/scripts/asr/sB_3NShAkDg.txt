 Okay, so we're getting ready to put a hot tub up here. It's pretty good ways down. You can use this ramp system, lay it up here, let the winch up here and just pull it right up here. There it is. So this is what we're talking about. We're going to slide it right up them rails, right up onto that deck. That's right. Just stand under there so we can get a reference, see how high that is. How tall are you eight foot tall? He's about six foot. So you can see how tall that is. Okay, we've got our coast in place. So what we're going to do is put our 217 here, then it'll run a cable up, down just like that. We'll hook to the tub right down here and just pull it right up. That's what it looks like. We're getting ready to pull that. There on top of that deck. We have a lot to do. Once it starts, you have to come right up here. Okay, this is the rig. The last thing you're off the ground. Okay. Oh, I had a special day tonight and all kinds of stuff playing. Oh. So does it get videos from all length? Yeah. I'm going to move over here. Yeah, move around. Right. Come up to the side. Right.

Okay, what we have here today is a Coleman pot tap. It's a valve ball equipment. You push the liner, turn to LED lights on. You can get one, get two, and see the lights light up in the fountain back there. Which is pretty nice. And this also has a jet three. It's like a startup real nice. This particular one that's got the iPod dock with the remote control right here. It's back there. It's got the free fountain with the LED lights out. A beautiful tub. And just check it out. This is a beautiful Coleman. And you can get him from the spa guy. Let's try.
