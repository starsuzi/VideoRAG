 What's happening guys? This is Danny Torres with Kidova Mexican Grill and your tailgaming tip of the week. People, back baby, I love this time of year. I'm talking game day, tailgating, I got my grill's out, people throwing corn hole, tossing footfalls around. It's awesome time of the year. Today we're talking hand smash guacamole. Got some fresh hot sauce, some condoms, got some jalapenos, got some tomatoes, we all know what guacamole looks like after it sits for an hour or two hours. We had to figure out a way to keep it fresh, keep it looking bright and green all day long. The secret as it turns out, it's a lie. Take a knife, and it right down the middle, keep it a good solid squeeze. I'm talking half a line for about a bowl in this size. Next trick is a big old sheet of plastic. Get all the air out. That's the key to this exercise. Once you get that all nice and packed down in there, grab your plastic wrap, wrap it all the way around, toss it in the fridge tomorrow morning, throw it in the cooler, ready to go for the tailgate. I want to thank you guys for coming by today. We should check it out next week because we share more tips of the tray for your tailgating. This is Danny Torz, if you don't want Mexican grow, I'll see you in the game.
