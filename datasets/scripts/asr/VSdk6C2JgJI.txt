 Alright, so we all love frying. We've got to know a few things about the dangers of frying, though. When you have oil in a pot, solid displaces oil. I've got a pan of water here and I'm just going to show that. You know, if you were going to deep fry your turkey and you've got a pot full of oil and you're ready to go and you drop your turkey in, this is what's going to happen. And you're going to have a big fire and your house is going to burn down. So you've got to remember that the amount of solid that's going in to the liquid, the liquid isn't going to go more than at most three quarters of the way at the pot. When I cook with oil, I fill a pot to about half way if I'm doing fish or chips or a fried candy bar, say. You can use different implements, you can use different pots to fry with. I've got a wok going right there which has got less oil in again. The whole idea is just to keep the oil in the pot, not on the stove, not in direct contact with the flame. Really, when you cook at home, when you fry at home, please consider water displacement or oil displacement. You know, frying is great. You don't want to burn your house down. It's always good to have a thermometer handy. You don't want the oil to go up both. Sort of 375 is maximum for your house. And if you follow these guidelines, you'll have a good, safe frying experience. Whatever you do, don't do what they do in England, come back from the pub, put the chip pan on, sit down in the chair and go to sleep because they usually burn their houses down. And that's the last thing we need.
