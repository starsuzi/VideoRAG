 Hi everyone this is Tina H. Happy Thanksgiving from my family to yours. I am making Thanksgiving dinner. Got my apron on and I just want to show you a quick recipe for baked corn. Let me take y'all down here into the bowl. Alright, you need two cans of corn. I always use the whole kernel and a can of the cream style. And you want to drain your corn. This recipe is always requested by my son. And there's never any leftovers. It's always gone. So I highly recommend it. It's a very easy E3 eggs. You want to beat those up well. 3 tablespoons of flour. I even have Larry out here in the kitchen working. He's putting the pineapple and the cherries on the ham. We are not a turkey family. Larry's work did give him a turkey and we donated it back. I went to the food bank. Yeah, went to the food bank. We just can't do a 20 pound old bird. For the cup of sugar. Of course, band it out here watching. Use the sous chef for today. Two cups of milk. And a teaspoon of salt. I just normally just sprinkle some in. And a half a stick of margarine. It says it's a very easy recipe. You put this in the oven at 400. For 45 to 60 minutes. Or you can also put it in the microwave for 20 minutes. So I will show you the end result. Thank you so much for watching. And I'll be right back in a little bit. Here's my baked corn. I will include all the recipe down below. So you can try it. It's a wonderful recipe. It's very easy. Happy Thanksgiving. Bye.
