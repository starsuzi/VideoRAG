 Yeah, this is a fish. Are you really going to get a cleaner body? Want warm water? Turn it off so it doesn't scare her. If you want warm water, you can use a washcloth or paper towel. Don't pick at it. Don't pick the poop off because it'll tear her skin off and we don't want to do that. So it just kind of has poop all over. Over her belly and everything. They're going to tweak and squeak because they don't know what's good for them. But it's important to get all this off. Here we go. It's okay. That is really loud. Sure, you get all of it off. There's still a little bit left. You might have to hold the warm, wet, washcloth on that for a little while. At least, it's not up. There we go. She also has stuff on her chest. So this part's kind of hard. There we go. There we go. Here comes the cat. There we go. There we go. There we go.
