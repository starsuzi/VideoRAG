 Hey everybody we're making Duckfart shots to welcome in the new year. So what's in them? Kaluah, Bailey's Irish Cream, and Whiskey. So take your shot glass and pour in about a half an ounce of Kaluah. And then you're going to take a spoon, turn it upside down, and slowly, and I mean real slow pour in the Bailey's Irish Cream. It's important to pour slowly to create the layers. Hey get this, it is said that the Duckfart is to Alaska, what the Maitailles to Hawaii, and the Margarita is to Mexico. Once you get your Bailey's layer in there, next we're going to move into the whiskey, and we're going to do the same thing with that. Only we're going to pour a little bit less. So this drink should be served at room temperature, so don't be tempted to add any ice. And you need to drink it in one go. This is not a sipping kind of drink. Otherwise the flavors won't blend right, and believe me when I say it goes down easy. Happy New Year everybody, and be safe out there.
