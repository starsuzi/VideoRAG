 So in terms of catheterisation, if you want to kind of start giving it a go. So firstly, we'll probably clean first before we put that on. So pop that one down. Yes, the clean first. So clean together of course. Okay, the goal is going as a cross of the penis. Brilliant. It'll be like that. Very good. Keep it away. Fantastic. And then I'm going to use this. With some forceps. Yeah. Only one. And then get rid of it. Yeah. So clean the actual. That's great. Okay. Alright. So you've cleaned it all. That's nice and clean. You get rid of that one. That's perfect. Yeah. And I'm going to put another one now. What you're going to do first. Yeah, good. Throw it away. Okay, good. Just shiny side down. Brilliant. To make sure there's water proof on it. Okay. And we are putting you know, this goes around as well. Yeah. To keep it clean and tidy and a little higher. Good. Because there's a model. So yeah, okay. So you're right. So when, just show me how you put in stiller gelin. And we'll take it away. Yep. And shall I put it in? Don't inject it because this is just water. Okay. But if you're going to put. If you hold the penis out and up. Okay. So get used to holding that hand out and up. That's important because it straightens the urethra. Alright. You said in real person, shall we keep it in this position as well under 90 degrees? Yes. For the instillage, yes. And then penis about there when you're inserting it. In the model, it needs to be like that. So for inserting the capeter. Okay. So in a real person, you hold it round and up. Straighten the urethra and then pop the instillage out. Like that. Brilliant. Let's get it. Okay. So we're putting away the stuff. Yeah. Okay. And then we'll keep this for water good. Okay. So we're going to put it across over here. Alright. And then I'll hold this for you. And then you just need to open up the capeter. Thank you. It's good. Okay. Alright. And then we have kind of. One thing I would say is always move towards a patient with the capeter in the kidney dish. So if you put it like this, then you lift up kidney dish towards the patient. And then you lift up the capeter. Because otherwise what will happen is this will dangle. And you run the risk of destabilising it. Alright. That's good. Okay. And then with this bit you need your fingers to be around the shaft of the penis. To grab down on the capeter. There we go. And then take it back with it. Perfect. Just be careful to avoid the plastic touching the penis. As you do it. All this tests are original. Ah. Yeah. So the way to get round that is if you hold it tighter here. And you hold it closer to the bit that you're bringing back. So hold this bit there. You mean hold it. Yeah. Put the bag. So pull the bag back a little bit. That's it. And then you hold there we go. And then you push it to there and then stop. And then hold it tight. Because you don't want this plastic to touch the skin. So stop there we go. Perfect. Just like that. And you see when it bends there, did you see how the capeter bends? Yes. To stop that. If you pinch it here, when you advance the capeter. So you hold it closer then it won't bend. Like that. See? Yeah. Yeah. You can use it. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's fine. That's the model. That's fine. Okay. So pull that. Pull the plastic bag off. That's fine. Back it up into there. That's fine. And then. Inflate the balloon. Perfect. All right. Yeah. Okay. And the flag is. Yeah. There we go. Great. Perfect. All right. So then if the patient is circumcised, you've got to pull the force gun back. Because otherwise you get to parrhoff by Moses. But yeah, that was really good. Nice one.
