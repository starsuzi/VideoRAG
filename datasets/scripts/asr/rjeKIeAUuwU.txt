 Hello and welcome to part 2 of Cupcake Addictions Roast Turkey Feast Tutorial where I'll be showing you how to make the second part of our Roast Turkey Feast which is our mashed potato and gravy cupcake and our cherry pie cupcake. In part 1 we showed you how to make the Roast Turkey cupcake and also the carrots and peas on a plate cupcake so check that one out if you want to get the whole feast together. Tools and equipment that I will be using today I've got a rolling pin, I've got two butter knives, I've got one sharp knife, I've got two cupcakes ready to ice, I've got a little bit of corn flour just in a shake out you can also use icing sugar I'm just going to use that to prepare the surface to roll out some caramel, I've also got two squares of caramel fudge, I've got a little bit of our perfectly piped buttercream frosting and a little bit of our chocolate ganache, recipes and tutorials for both of those around our channel if you'd like to know how to make both or either, I've got two circle cookie cutters, the larger one is a 3 Â¼ inch or 8 centimeter and then the other one that I've chosen is just about two sizes down from that so it doesn't have to be an exact measure just something that's a little bit wider than the outside edge of your cupcake, I've got a little bit of melted dark chocolate and I've got some mini M&Ms and I've just picked out all the red ones because I've decided on cherry pie today, we're going to start off with this delicious potato and gravy cupcake, it's the easiest of the two so we'll get it out of the way, for this one we're just going to take a couple of blobs of that perfectly pipable buttercream frosting in white and just blob them on top, now you just want to work that back and forward with the knife, be careful not to get too far over the sides, you want to try and keep it as neat as possible, add a little bit more if you think you'd like more potato, now I just smoothed it out, I suppose pushed it out to the edges and then flatten down the top a little bit, make sure you've got a relatively flat top because you don't want all of that gravy just to go like spilling off the edges of it, so I'm just going to flatten out the top, I'm going to smooth off the edge a little bit but you don't want it to be too perfect because this is supposed to be a bit of a mound of potatoes, so after I smooth off the edge I'm just going to run my knife back and forward until I'm happy that I've got something that looks like a plate full of mashed potato, alright so I'm happy that looks like it's a little bit of a mashed potato, if you do get any around the edges just use your finger just to wipe up the edges there just to clean it up and for the gravy it's going to be as simple as pouring a little bit of this dark chocolate onto the top of the cupcake, now I like to pour it into the middle and then I'm just going to give it a shake and let it fall wherever it wants to fall just like gravy would, a bit of a tap, you'll see it starts to inch its way down the edges, pull over the top, slide down the sides a bit, so there you have a delicious potato and gravy cupcake, now let's move on to our cherry pie, I decided for a chocolate ganache frosting with the cherry pie, I just went with the chocolate ganache because I know that it's going to take me a little bit of time to lay out all those minium and em's and I wanted to make sure I didn't get something that was going to dry out, the buttercream tends to crust quite quickly and it makes it hard for those M&M's to stick to it, so I'm just going to make a bit of a smooth dome of chocolate ganache on this second cupcake, I also like the look of the dark peeking through in between the M&M's rather than the dark white, the dark seems to blend in a little bit better, so it just doesn't have to be perfect, a bit of a dome there, now I'm going to take a little bit of that caramel fudge, now this is really soft caramel fudge, so it's not your caramel, I suppose your caramel shoes, it's actually a caramel fudge, going to give that a little bit of a need in between my hands just to soften it up and get any cracks out of it, you'll see it's really pliable, really easy to need, if you're using an actual caramel shoe, you can pop it in the microwave for a few seconds at a time until it's soft enough for you to work in this way, get a pop down a little bit of that cornflour, this is just to prepare the surface so that my caramel doesn't stick, all right, now I'm going to take the larger circle cutter and I'm just going to cut a circle, and then I'm going to just lift it up off the bench of that stage to make sure it's not stuck, and take a smaller cutter and just cut a little circle on the inside, shut it up with a bit of a ring, now with that ring it's just going to form something around the edges that the rest of our outsides can stick to, so just pull it around and it's really just edging that cupcake, giving the rest of the caramel something to stick to, so you should have something that looks like this, a little bit messy at the moment but we'll get there, now this is probably the most time-consuming part of this tutorial, it's doing our mini M&M, so I like to start around the outside edges and I'm just going to apply those M&Ms around in circles until I hit the middle, and that's the last of them, so now you should have some something that looks like this, now we're going to take the rest of that caramel, both pieces, and once again just give it a nice little need, roll it into a ball, a little bit more cornflour on the table, nice little wipe around in that cornflour, and we're going to roll out another piece, we're going to cut between 8 and 10 of these little strips that are going to go across the top, and these are what really make this pie, I'm not worried about the edges of the strips, I don't mind if they're quite messy in different lengths, but I'm just going to cut across a make 10 nice strips, all right so I've got all my stripes there laid out ready to go, I'm going to start in the middle of my pie, and I'm just going to lay them across, I'm starting at the middle because I want to make sure that I use my longest ones where they're needed, so I think I used nine on this one here, I'm just laying that across the top, I'm just letting it sit on top of those M&Ms for now, push it down a little bit if you like, with a stick of the caramel, we'll help to stick it to the M&Ms, turn it around, start in the middle once again with your longest piece, and wake you way to those outer edges, all right so once you've reached this stage, just give everything a little bit of a push down, that starts to resemble more of a pie, then it's time to get our edges organized, so any of these little leftover bits that are around the edges, just tuck them up, so just use your finger in your thumb just to tuck them up, and as you're doing that pinch out from the cupcake, just tucking and pinching until you get a nice little, I guess a little crusty edge there for your pie crust, so that is our cherry pie cupcake, combined with our lovely mashed potato and gravy cupcake, part two of our roast turkey feast tutorial, we hope you've enjoyed this lovely Thanksgiving themed tutorial, thanks very much for watching,
