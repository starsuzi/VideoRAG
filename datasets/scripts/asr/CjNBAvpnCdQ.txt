 One of the latest trends in kitchen design is home appliances that have a professional style look, but don't have a pro price. And that's what we're seeing here from the new Kenmore Pro lineup. They're based on the Kenmore Elite series. They're nothing different on the inside, but you have a design that feels a little bit more substantial. But it doesn't look overwrought. You'll notice these candles here, the brackets that hold them on are really solid and chunky, but they're not looking like they're mimicking a viking or a wolf to their own feel for your own kitchen. You'll see a minimalist look here on the water dispenser. Depending upon what you want, just press on it and it'll switch between water, ice cubes, crushed ice, open it up, and you'll see even more lighting. You'll see stainless, you'll see glass, you'll see the same things that you'd see in a Kenmore Elite fridge, but with just an extra special touch. For instance, this wine rack holder. Inside the shelves, you'll see that there's actually a plastic rubber matting underneath here, which means if you spill something, you can just take it out and clean it. So it really is for people who like to cook, not for people who just want to say that they like to cook. The whole design is meant to blend into a home kitchen, but give it a little bit about professional upscale feel.
