 Every Sunday I make an enormous thing of roast vegetables. Here's a few quick tips to help making roast vegetables even easier. To start, make sure when you have your roast vegetables that things like butter, nut, squash, potatoes, carrots, you cut into two inch pieces. Things like broccoli and cauliflower can be a little bit bigger because they have a little bit more open space on them. What you want to do is put everything on a baking sheet for easier cleanup. If you're lazy like me, you can put a piece of foil on the bottom and you're just going to drizzle the olive oil. You don't need buckets and buckets of olive oil when you're roasting vegetables because what you're trying to really do is just evenly coat them so that they look shiny, not dripping wet. Okay, so when you've got them all coated like that, when it takes a second, you can season them with just a little bit of kosher salt, but you can also use some nice herbs if you want. Now, very important, make sure that they are all spread out. You don't want everything to be on top of each other because then the length of just steaming up host do really roasting and getting really caramelized. You're going to put this in a 450 degree oven. You want your oven to be hot so they get caramelized nice and golden. It's too low a temperature. It's not going to work. So make sure your temperature is high. If you have a convection oven, use it. It helps the air to circulate and everything to get even more golden. And that's how you make perfect roast vegetables. Nice and caramelized, delicious and even a little bit crispy on the edges.
