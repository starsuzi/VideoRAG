 by tensioning tools here need cleaning and I've just got things that are all over them this is just vinegar so I'm gonna soak them in white vinegar for a while right there, white vinegar and then I'll recover so I can use it again but I'm just gonna let them soak for a little while and that should get these tensioning tools all clean and like branched, manking okay so I'd be sitting for a couple of hours maybe maybe three hours the vinegar I've used a few times so it's not really well that's strong but I'm gonna save it one more time and I'll quote back into the bottle and I'll see how they came out okay I'll let them soak for a bit okay I'll let them soak for a bit and they look like they came out pretty clean so there like brand new tension tools
