 Hai and welcome to a new video on how to tie a ball cloned. So this is pork, it could be veal, it could be beef, it's the same technique. Why do I want to tie it? Because when I'm cooking it, I want it to keep a nice shape you know. So to be able to do that it needs to be tied. Very simple technique here. Watch very carefully. So to do that I have a lot of string here. I have that string right now in a glass. What needs to happen is I need it, it needs to come easily to me. So here we go. I'm taking the string and I'm going to go under very long here. Bring up and I'm going to tie the string. I'm going to do what we call a butcher nut. I'm going like that, I'm going to go once and twice under and tie it. Twist it and finish the nut. You just made a butcher nut. Okay that was the first part. Now I'm going to take the string. I'm going to make a loop with my hand like that. Okay I'm going to go under it. This way I'm going to pull with my right hand and then with the left hand. Like that. One more time you make a loop. You're going under the meat. You pull with your right hand and tie it with your other hand. That was my left hand by the way. Again. Make a loop. Under the meat. Pull with your hand and tie with your other hand. Again. Make a loop. Go under the meat. Pull with one hand and tie with your other hand. Okay to finish that I'm going to flip the meat over like that. I'm going to cut my string but make sure I have a nice string to go all the way and reach with that other piece of string we had when we started. Here we go. I'm going to go under the string here and pull it. Again under and pull. Under and pull. Keep it tight. Under it and pull it. Keep it tight. And here. If there are then you're going to reach here with the other string but was left with the other piece of string. And you tie making another butchered. And here you did your tight rust. I hope you enjoyed that quick demo. If you did please give me a thumb up and subscribe. Thank you.
