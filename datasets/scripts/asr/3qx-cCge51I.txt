 Okay YouTube, zookeeper here again and what we have today is a mole hole, pocket gulp or actually and what I'm going to show you briefly is a pot of kilpocket gulpers in mass in about three minutes. So the first thing is I got this mole hole here, pocket hole for mound and what you have to do is find the hole and dig the dirt out a bit very gently. There we go, I can get that hand in there. You can get a piece of hose like this. This one's about four feet long, put it in the hole, a little bit, slip it in the exhaust of the tractor or lawn mower or whatever else you happen to have handy. Back through around it. Now you start the tractor and let it run for a couple hours, lawn mower, whatever you have and you'll have a whole bunch of asphyxiated pocket gulpers or models in about three hours. So I'm going to go ahead and start the tractor. You can see it's just an idle, nothing fancy. This is a diesel gasoline that works just as well. You do have to use a silicone rubber hose though that will either fit over the outside of your exhaust pipe or over or fit into the inside like this one does. There you go, just leave it run for a couple hours and you'll have dead pocket gulpers. Going for a few hours.
