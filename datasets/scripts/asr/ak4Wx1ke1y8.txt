 Well it's summer and the cicada killers are out in full force as they fly menacingly around my deck. Now I've seen for me that none of the family or friends want to come out here with these horrific looking little monsters so it's time to get rid of it. It's time to take out the trash and here's the right tool for the job. Okay the proper method of cicada hunting is to wait for one of these little foxes to sit here and menace me which he's going to be coming to and boom! Yeah take that bitch! There he is right there. You've got a good look in your death throws. Die and into the deck you go. No that is how cicada hunting in Missouri works. A little rusty here. And of course it's not easy to do this with my camera watching. I'm going to watch on it. There's another one. How's that one? How's that feel buddy huh? Die! Yeah I do have kind of a nasty looking stinger on them don't they? We do not fear that here. That's cicada hunting in Missouri. That's cicada killer. What? Got a nice backhand on that one. So I've pretty much decimated most of them out here. Here's a few here and you want something don't you? Well and here's your brother and he's going to get some too. You want him to get a little bit wet. Yeah you got hammered didn't you baby. You picked the wrong house to menace and you're marked for finish him. Oh and blink. Oh miss that one. Missed a golden opportunity there. That's all right. Hope you back because cicada killers. Not real bright.
