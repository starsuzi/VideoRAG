 I'm Michael Chernau and I am the owner of Seymour's and co-owner of the Meatball Shop in New York City and you are watching Tasting Table TV. I am a fish eater. Fish makes up, fish and vegetables make up about 90% of my diet and then the other 10% is meatballs. I wanted to sort of do a restaurant that was based around this sort of local New York seafood. And with that I wanted to keep it as simple as that with fish tacos, fish sandwiches and simply seared fish with sides. For me when I really think of a fish sandwich I think of like a nice buttery bun, a perfectly grilled piece of fish, lettuce and tomato. Season your fish all along the pan very, very hot. You want to make sure that that pan is piping, piping hot. You put your fish on season both sides and then you let it cook. I would say let it cook anywhere from a minute and a half to two minutes. On one side you get a nice seared, don't touch it. Don't touch it, don't move it. Just let it cook. If you try to move it before it starts to really caramelize it's going to stick to the pan no matter how much oil you have on it and it's not going to be fun. And then flip it. Let it cook for another minute and a half to two minutes. Put your fish on the bun and you take your citrus aeoli or honestly mayonnaise. You know what I mean? Like aeoli is a, it could be a pan in the butt for somebody who's never made it before. You're talking only on top of that. Not a lot, just enough to get that flavor. You put your lettuce, your tomato, top it, ready to go.
