 Vanilla is the world's most popular flavor and one of the most expensive spices and flavorings. Some people, including those who know orchids, are unaware that vanilla comes from the fruit of the vanilla orchid and particular from its seeds pods or botanically decapsules. Every tropical gardener wants to have a vanilla plant and of course the most common question they ask is, how do I make my vanilla plant produce vanilla for me? In this video we will show you how and more. Now, we pollinate a vanilla very, very simple. We call this a toothpick being humans, however to the orchid it's a sex toy. We go in and actually take off the sepals and petals. Do not worry if you break them off as this is not necessary to ensure pollination. We then take back the lip or lebellum. There's only one lip so we're not dealing with labia minoris or majoris. We then take off the anther cap to expose the polinea. This yellow mass right here is the polinea. We then take the polinea out and then we gently with the nest love and understanding. We set right behind the stigma and then we back away hoping that the vanilla was of legal aid. And hopefully in a few days we'll see the seed pod hole. We have a couple of examples of successfully pollinated vanilla. Here's one right here. Here you can see the vanilla bean growing. And we have a couple other examples right here. The vanilla beans can indeed get quite large. The flower normally stays open only for one day and without pollination the blossom willts and falls without forming a bean. Each flower must be pollinated within 12 hours of opening. Have fun and enjoy your homemade vanilla. Having pollinated the vanilla flower they generally like a cigarette afterward.
