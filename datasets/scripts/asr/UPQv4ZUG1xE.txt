 Hi there, I'm Matt from the Underground Cookery School and today I'm going to do a video cookery lesson for you. Hi, I'm going to show you how to cook red lentils. I've got about 40 grams worth of red lentils which is good for about a portion and all you really need to do is just sling them in a pan like that. Over here I'm just going to, I'm going to cover them with water and then go probably an inch further. Now just keep an eye on those because what will happen is the lentils will absorb quite a lot of the moisture so if you do need to top out with water so be it but let it bubble away for I reckon between 10 and 15 minutes and just keep tasting them until you're satisfied with the texture. So we're going to come back to those in a second. Those have been on the hob for about 12 minutes actually and I'm just going to drain them or pass them through a sieve just to get rid of all that moisture. Now I'll plate up not really the most ground dishes. There we go. Now lentils work really well in curries so something like a dial for example. They're great as a vegetarian option, you know maybe stuffing them using them to stuff some mushrooms. It's so very good for thickening out soups but it's a good all round vegetarian supplement, a little bit of olive oil there, a little bit of black pepper. There you have how to cook, red lentils.
