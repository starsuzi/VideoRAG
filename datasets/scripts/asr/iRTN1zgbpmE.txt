 This is a video review on the professional hair clipper grooming set from one is all So what you see in front of you is everything that comes with the set you get a lot of different Assessories it's getting the grim everything on your pet from their coat all the way down to their nails So this is a perfect set to have in the home or if you have a business as well I mean this it's great quality and it comes with everything you need So I definitely could see uses both at home or in a business It does come nicely packaged in this box here So it also has slots in here which is good for storage But it also comes with this felt helps that you see here So if you don't want to use the box you could store the clippers in here as well It does have your user manual here so you want to read through that and get a custom The how it works and the different accessories here You did get a bonus replacement battery which is always good to have Let's see I guess I will start with the grooming tools themselves right here So you get a nice heavy-doodle metal comb and this is good if you have a dog with a thick cut of fur And you're going to matted fur this is not going to break the teeth of the king of money things That's definitely great to have You got your standard nail clippers here They do have the safety latch on the back here And they're push sprang easy to open and close Your metal nail file and this is great because it can be washed and reused As well as just parasiters here And this was actually one of the things I was kind of most in all with when I opened the kit Because of how well these are actually made I mean they're even not just for pet hair They're great for cutting human hair as well I mean they have the finger slant there They open and close very smoothly They cut right away I just can't say enough good things They have the scissors The scissors are definitely a great addition to the set It's very easy, it does partially charge But you do want to make sure you get a full charge before first use So you don't run out of battery carefully through I mean you actually do have a replacement battery So you can switch back and forth if that was to happen But you want to always try to have a full charge So you just go ahead and slide the battery in there And then it has your two prong wall out left there So go ahead and plug it in And then it has a red Let's see, the red light by my thumb there That will illuminate when it's charging And it will turn green once a full charge So I'm going to go ahead I'll go through the features of that That was the battery there So that's the replaceable battery And it does just pull out Actually prior to first use There is some cellophane on it Same thing you would use to wrap your food in the kitchen So you want to remove that prior to first use around the battery And then just slide right back in You're ready for use And all that is listed on here Which I mean even myself sometimes when I get a new item Sometimes I don't tend to redo everything Especially single paper like that So that's definitely something I wanted to bring to the attention is to make sure I mean kind of sent to but it might be a real oxygen Just remove the cellophane before your first use You do get the brush cleaning here So that's going to go ahead and clean any fine hairs from the top here Due to shipping restrictions The package will not include the oil accessories That is also written on this little paper here So as you can see it is well greased prior to use And that will last quite a few uses But you do want to get your own grease degreased up As it needs to over time The instructions are very well written Everything you need to know is going to be in here And it walks you through everything So I definitely recommend looking through this And keeping it for reference that you have There are different clipper attachments here So depending on the length that you want your pet's coat You got selection to choose from as well As if you just wanted to shave and boil You could just use it the way it is as well So you got your 3mm 3mm 6 9 And 12 And they are labeled on the back for face reference And especially some of these ones are kind of hard to tell Completely which ones bigger if you are in a hurry And you just want to pick up and grab it So they are fairly easy to put on You kind of slide the back grooves in there Up into the metal part here So you want to slide it in Until it is in place and then push it down So once it is on It will be straight and you can see straight across there To take off it is pretty easy to just push up And it pulls right off So for use Another thing it also has fine-tuned blade adjustment Which is right here so you can adjust it from 0.8mm To I believe it is 2mm So that is written on there as well And it is done just by simply turning this The power on and off you simply push it up And as you can hear it has a very whisper quiet meter So it is not going to be too loud Something that is going to alarm the pet or cause more anxiety or anything for them It is very lightly You don't have the cord to worry about being in your way So you have the freedom of the need of ability When grooming the pet without having to work around the cord itself So look I said overall just with everything this kit includes How well the quality of it is Everything like that, this is a great kit I definitely recommend it It is going to get the job done and it has everything you could possibly need So if you have any questions If I have not believe anything yet that you are still wondering about Please feel free to comment under my review And I will do my best to answer them for you Thank you for taking the time to watch the video
