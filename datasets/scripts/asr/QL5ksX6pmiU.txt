 So I recently built this parts bench which the kai zan wall behind me and I am absolutely loving it now I started by organizing this side and by putting my shoe box organization underneath the bench over here And today I'm putting for my cadal now I wasn't originally planning on doing this but because I do a lot of jigs and a lot of metal parts I've been beating up this bench pretty good and I want it to be durable and look nice for a long time So I found some for my car on sale one of the local big box stores And I have been installing it this morning and I thought I would shoot a quick how to Just for those of you who might be interested in installing it and don't really know how to do it So I bought a 4x8 shooter that's that I ripped it in half on the table saw as long as you find to take Find to the blade on the table saw and go slow it works nicely Now what I need to do is cut off a section of this piece About an inch longer than what I need Now because I've got a four foot section here and this is two feet wide Crosscut to get on the table saw is not really an option unless you have a really big a cross cut sled So now with those marked out I need to score that line or score a line across here and I am using a safe safe cut track and a safe cut mouse This is a new to me product that I wish I would have had years ago. This is an awesome phenomenal product It's basically like a track south for a razor blade. So this mouse has a retractable razor blade in it and it rides along this track right here and then you just put your fence right up against them on your marks and Score your lines. I'm just gonna pull the for like a down to the edge of the bench here Just so that line is near the edge Okay, so on my bench I've got some cables sticking through and Rather than taking the cables out and then putting it in and then trying to drill that hole in the same spot And I because I don't have room to get a router around there. I'm just gonna cut that little section out Okay, so I'm gonna use my jigsaw to cut that out and I've got a Just a wood cutting blade in there with a high tooth count and I put painters tape over the top of the for Micah And I've got a half inch piece of plywood is a backer and what that's gonna do is help alleviate any nasty tearout And before I glue it up, I'm just gonna come back and clean it up a little bit with some sandpaper And you want to keep the backer behind there while you're doing that so you're not you know You don't have it sitting out here and you're pulling down and break off a piece Okay, so with everything cut I'm just gonna come back and make sure I don't have any big chunks In here that are gonna prevent these two from joining really nicely just kind of clean that out a little bit And then I always do the wood surface first because the for Micah side is gonna dry much faster than the wood is A little painter's tape along that edge goes a long way And then just come in and brush it in there now you want to make sure you get a good Coverage on not only the countertop, but I also like to get a little bit on that edge And then do the same over here Now It's worth mentioning when you're using contact cement do it in a very well-ventilated area or if you have to be inside If you're doing a kitchen countertop use a respirator or you're gonna end up very happy and not not in a good way Now you want to wait for the contact cement to dry and basically when it's dry to the touch It's ready. So before you install it you're gonna want to lay something down and I like using pecs tubing This you can get this it's five bucks for 20 feet of this stuff and it works great So I just throw some pecs tubing down and that way I can position the piece basically where I need it before I start pushing down Because once you put some pressure and those two sides touch each other. There's no pulling it apart or It's a real pain in the butt So So if you're creating a union or a seam it's always best to start there or if you're working from a quarter It's always best to start in the quarter. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna line these up Before I push it down now you have to adjust your pecs tubing move it out a little bit whatever and at this point What I'm gonna do is kind of push into that seam and Then use my J-brock roller to get a good Bite right there on that edge Now that I'm comfortable with that I'm just gonna come along and pull these out as I go along pushing down to get some adhesion And then using my roller I'm gonna go ahead and push down Really hard on the surface now when you're coming out towards the edge you want to be careful that you don't come off and Push down because you can break it and you might get a little chip out into the counter So be real careful when you're out by the edge as best as to go along the edge with the J-brock roller And try to push in one direction or out towards the front or back So they do make some specialty bits that look like this for edging for Mike I like this They work okay if you've got a for Mike a face and you're in your edging over that But if you're a natural material or wood these little metal edges tend to burn so I don't use them I typically just use a standard of bearing guided flush drug flush cut bit like that And then route the edges And when you're out the edges you're always gonna end up with a little hanger on up next to any wall Now there's different methods for doing this But one of the things that I like to do is I use a pull saw and I just get right up quite close tight to that And then I'll come back with a file and clean that edge up So once you've ran the router across it with the flush trim bit it's gonna leave a really sharp edge So come across it with a fine file and just dress that edge up So it might be hard to see but I have some residue left right here on the seam and if that ever happens just a little mineral spirits And it'll clean it right up And then if you get any some if you get any of that Well the wood any place you don't want it mineral spirits will take care of it pretty quickly But it's a little bit of elbow grease I got for my gun my bench I Have really excited about getting the shop just up and really make it some serious improvements in here I wouldn't call it a dream sheet a dream garage But close so happy to have them for my condone metal shavings grease and you're not gonna wipe right off now No big deal. So it's pretty easy thing to do once you get a few tips and tricks down So I hope some people found this helpful and you just to throw it out there This is one of those things that you can get into for very little money It doesn't require a bunch of fancy tools and I know some guys that make a pretty decent two guys that make a pretty decent living Just doing for my countertops just saying Hey, hey, nice nice week Also, I want to shout out to fast cap the more I learn about those guys the more I love them now fast cap does some really Incredible products, but this one right here as far as I'm concerned they out and did themselves I absolutely love the safety cut mouse the safety cut ruler I already ordered a five foot section of this so I can make my three foot my five foot eight feet and Just so you know they can make this in any length you want, you know custom lengths So I'll just give them a call if you're interested.
