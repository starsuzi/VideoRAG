 Hi everybody, so it's been a while since I've done an unboxing and here is an unboxing of course. It's something that I have been wanting to start one a new business which I have several. I wanted this so bad because I'm always making t-shirts and I always have people asking me to make them. So in order to get the cost down and to keep a little bit more in my pocket I decided to do something different. So here it is the unboxing. Let's see how well this is packed. It's packed pretty good. And... Wala, look at it. It's very well packed. It smells really good. It's a heat press, 15 by 15. So here it is. Right now there's the whole thing. Forgive the lighting and really sucks. Sorry about that. I don't have to lighting in my house. It's raining outside too. So yeah, I'm excited to get it. I will show you a garment after I do a heat... Plastic seal, heat transfers what I will be using which is screen printing with a heat press. I'm excited. There are no dents on it. It's in good condition. There's nothing wrong with it. I bought it brand new. I think it's originally like $500 and I got it for a whole lot cheaper than that. And I'm excited. So this is the temporary spot for it right now. When we get everything set up I'll show you guys. Okay, so I have officially set it up. Is set to 3.30. The time is... Seconds is 10. So it's 3.30 is the heat. And I've already preheated the press. This is my first run. I have already got some plastic seal transfers. This one says mind over matter that I really liked. I used to go to the shop and so the guy showed me how to... How far it should be down from the neck and all this stuff like that. So yeah, I'm about to do my first press. And here we go. Down we go. I'm going to let it warm for a second and then do a peel. There it is. It's that. Here's the shirt.
