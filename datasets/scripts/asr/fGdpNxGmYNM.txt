 In today's episode, I will show you the small centerpiece found in my garden and the story behind it. This year, my garden was infested by root millie box. I tried to clean all the infested containers. In one part, there were no trays of root millie box, but there were a lot of small centerpiece. My guess was the centerpiece hunted and ate all the root millie box. Sun species of centerpiece feed on springtails. Since root millie box is similar in size and less mobile, they would be good praise for the centerpiece. I will introduce the centerpiece to another container that was heavily infested by root millie box to see whether my theory is correct. If you like this video, please like, share and subscribe.
