 Okay, so unbeknownst to my brother, I'm actually in his house right now sitting on one of his couches. He has five kids and has only these couches for about eight years. I don't know if you can really see, but I'm sinking pretty well into this couch. There's really no support. And that's where furniture fix could come in. So if you've got a couch that's maybe sinking or has sunk or has zero support in the middle or whatever, this could be a product for you. It comes with six plastic slates like this. And I'm just going to go ahead and put this together and see if this does. In fact, fix your furniture because this is pretty bad. Nice. Okay, something else I'm going to show you that my brother's probably going to kill me for is he actually bought some furniture, some kind of furniture device and they're these plastic slat of things. They don't work at all. I mean, the whole thing is slanted and doesn't seem to be working. So I've got the furniture fix installed on the left seat. We're going to go check it out right now. Okay, so we're back at the left seat and on this side that I'm sitting on, there's no support. I'm back to the normal pre-furniture fix and on this side I have the support so I'm going to flip over to this side right now. Wow, that's pretty different. I feel like I'm sitting up straight or there's definitely a lot of support on any of my backside here keeping it clean. And one of the things I am noticing is that I'm kind of sinking towards the middle because there's zero support in the center. So one of the downsides I'd say to furniture fix is that for a small love seat like this, I'd need two packages of furniture fix to get all the way across and bridge that gap so that sinking would not happen. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product. I think it works pretty nice. It's definitely giving me a lot of support underneath the cushion here. And so I'm dating with television friendsies. I'm going to give furniture fix a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Great product. I'd like to have more of the slats in here because let it get all the way across and take care of this in one shot. But there you go. Over now.
