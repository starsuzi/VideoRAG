 Hi everybody welcome back to my channel. In today's first fall video I'm going to show you how to make these DIY candles. So if you're interested please keep on watching. Alright so the first thing we're going to need is mason jars and I got mine at Michael's for 99 cents. Then I got these candles at Ross for $3 and you need more flat candles. I think they're called floating candles I'm not sure. Next you're going to need some fillings. I got some of this from Michael's and the rest my mom gave to me. I'm not sure where she gets them so I'll ask and put it in the description box below. Finally you're going to need a peeler. Alright so after you've taken out the top of the jars and measured just how smuggling your candle already fits you can start shaving or peeling the sides of the candle until it fits in the jar without a problem. Make sure to stop peeling once in a while and measure how easy it already goes in to see if you need to peel more or if it's already good enough. Also instead of throwing away all of those leftovers of the candle you can put them in a container and store them because later you can melt them or do some other crafts and projects with them. Alright so this is my favorite part. This is where you get to start filling up and you can use whatever you want. You can use probably leaves, you can use anything else as long as you're satisfied with it it's good. Once you like what you see inside it's just time to put in the candles. Also you can adjust and shave off a little more depending on how snuggly it goes in and once you have the candles in you're done. Another thing you can do is put on the lid back and this is going to give it a neater look you can also add ribbon or whatever else you like. Alright so this is the finished product. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Please put down in comments, requests, questions below and I will see you in my next video. Bye guys.
