 Hi everyone, this is Susan Reaver coming to live from Regionsis Gashlin, the Organitarian.com and the HealthfulLightsdale.com. I just want to do a quick live video as you can see. I am actually in the midst of cleaning my large phycus indoor tree and what happens is you know over time you get a lot of dust and stuff on the leaves and of course this can impede its growth so these is way to clean a large plant like this is to actually stick it into your shower and then as you can see I'm just using a regular water bottle. Now the best thing if it's really really dusty is to use 10 parts water and one part sort of mild soap and all you're going to do is spray the leaves. Now what the soap will do is especially if you have a lot of dust on the leaves it will actually help pull the grime away and so that to make the dust and the dirt loose and then after you're going to then fill the water bottle just with all water and re-spray the leaves so that of course you're getting a the soap off and all the grime and as you can see definitely down below in my shower right so you can see all the dust that has actually fallen off from the leaves and then what you're going to do after is as you can see my phycus is now been spray just with water, spray it off most of the dust and you're just going to let it air dry and then you can put it back. Phycus especially don't like their leaves touched so you know this saves you time from you know taking cloth and like wiping each individual leaf which will be kind of you know a daunting task and two is not going to get all the leaves off so this is the best way to clean your indoor plants especially large ones is put them either in the sink or in a shower it's really dusty again use 10 parts water one part soap and spray the leaves the soap will help loosen the dirt and then refill the water bottle with all water and re-spray the leaves so that the dust and dirt fall off and then let the plant air dry. So if you guys have any questions just feel free to comment below would love to hear from you and hope you guys found this video helpful and we'll talk to you guys later bye
