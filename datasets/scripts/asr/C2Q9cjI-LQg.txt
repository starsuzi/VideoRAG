 How to make a smore. What you're going to need? One marshmallow. One gram cracker. A chocolate bar. A sharpened stick. And of course, a raging fire. Step one. A puffed mcmol. Place him on the end of Mr. Pointy. Be careful not to poke yourself. Next, hold him over the fire until he turns nice and golden brown. Contrary to popular belief, torching your marshmallow is NOT the way to make a smore. Step two. Take honey G. And break him into two halves. Remember now, it's horizontally not vertically. Next we'll need to look at chocolate swiveys back. Break off a section of three bars. Step three. Arrange in this order. Chocolate. Molo. That's how you make a smore.
