 Hello, today we're going to do a video on how to clean your balls, your pool balls that is. So first you're going to need something like this, an aromathered ball cleaner. You can clean the balls with that first. And then to get it over what they play with, always use little turtle wax. That way, use the turtle wax running compound, it cleans it, and also puts a good shine on balls and makes them good and slick. So, that means that let's get started. There should probably be one of the worst ones. So as much as you see that, the ball is really dirty and nasty. We got chalk marks all over it, burn spots. This is called a measle ball. Can you see it? So now, we're going to clean the ball cleaner. And put the ball in the rag. It's kind of screwed around. We got about a good 10, 15 seconds. More longer. You can got to look at the ball and see how clean the ball is getting, which you need to rub on. Try to get the extra dirt and chalk build up and stuff off. Okay, so now the cleaner. It's got the ball fairly clean. Now, we go to the next step. Make sure the ball is good and dry. Completely different towel. I used like the microfiber towel on this to make sure that I get it dirty and cleaned off and kind of lightly polished. And then the next step is the turtle wax. And what I do is up at the ball and tune the wax. And then it's kind of spinning around. And you can see the wax build up onto the ball. And then I take a completely different towel. And I'll put it in. And I do pretty much the same as I did the first step. Just kind of scrub it around. Rub it on it. Get that turtle wax work good in there. And it puts a nice shine on the ball. Nice clean shiny ball. All right. 16 more to go.
