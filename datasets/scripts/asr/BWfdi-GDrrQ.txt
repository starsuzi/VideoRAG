 Any bleeding injury in an animal can be a potentially serious injury. Bacteria from the teeth or claws can cause a serious infection in the skin or wound. If your pet will allow it, you can clean a scratch, a minor scratch with warm soapy water. You can then apply something like bassy tracin or neosporin for several days and it should heal. If your pet's wound is bleeding excessively, you should follow these steps immediately. First, muzzle your pet or restrain him so he doesn't bite you. Second, apply pressure directly to the wound with a clean, absorbent pad. You may use gauze pads, washcloths, towels, or sanitary napkins. Hold the pressure on the wound for at least three minutes to allow the blood to clot. Third, keep direct pressure on the wound and take your pet to the nearest vet clinic as soon as possible. If there is a vet clinic closer than your nearest vet, I highly recommend taking your pet there. Any external or internal bleeding can become a serious life threatening emergency. Pets can also bleed internally from trauma that does not break the skin. You should suspect internal bleeding if your pet is bleeding from the nose, mouth, rectum, or is coughing up blood. If you've see blood in the urine or if your pet has pale gums or is weak, keep him as warm and quiet as possible and take him to the nearest animal care facility. Don't second-guess yourself on this. Better be safe than sorry. If you have any questions, please contact your local vet or contact us here at Askiveat at macafeeah.com.
