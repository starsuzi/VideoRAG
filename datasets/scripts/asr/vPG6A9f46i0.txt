 Good morning Rachel here from day to day joys.com. I had bought some coffee from Costco. I like this organic blend and I left there without grinding the beans and I was thinking what have I done? So it's been sitting here for Emma House for about a week and I've just been going to pick up coffee somewhere else but I said enough is enough and I decided to try this out. I'm going to use my Vitamix to ground the coffee beans. So I'm going to set you right here while you watch how to do this. Just pour your beans right in. So I'll put your lid on securely. Put your setting on high around 9 or 10 on the variable setting and turn on high for about 10 seconds. And there you have it. It's not finely ground but it's not coarse. It's probably about medium. And then just put it in your airtight container to use. And then enjoy you a cup of coffee. Thanks for watching.
