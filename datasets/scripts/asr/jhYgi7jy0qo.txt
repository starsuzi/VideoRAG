 A Newton disc, invented by Isaac Newton, is a disc with segments in rainbow colors. When the disc is rotated, the colors fade to white. In this way Isaac Newton demonstrated that white light is a combination of the seven different colors found in a rainbow. A Newton disc can be created by painting a disc with the seven different colors. A combination of red, green and blue in the circular disc will yield the same result. This is due to the phenomenon called persistence of vision. It was an important discovery as it proves that light is not colorless, but is color in it which together converge to give a faded white color which we consider colorless. This property is based on the principles of dispersion of light. This experiment was final proof at white light is made up of all the colors of the spectrum. See also, Benham's top. References.
