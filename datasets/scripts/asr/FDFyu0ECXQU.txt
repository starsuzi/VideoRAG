 Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. So today I'm going to be cleaning out my closet and I figured I would kind of take you guys along with me and kind of show you guys the process that I do to clean up my closet and how I get rid of things. This is something I do every three or four months or I like to try to. I'm kind of like the opposite of a hoarder and I really get annoyed when I have things that I don't use on a regular basis and I just feel like I have things piling up that I don't need. So it just really makes me feel like I have my life in order to get rid and declutter my belongings. So today I'm going to be working on my wardrobe and just going through everything and re-evaluating whether or not they are things that I need and then go through and either donate or sell things that I'm trying to get rid of. So I thought I would share my process with you guys. So if you guys want some inspiration on how to clean and declutter your wardrobe then just keep watching. Okay so today I'm going to start with my closet because I feel like that's the easiest to just grab things out of and clean. So I like to start off on one side of my closet just a matter of which side but I just like to just kind of go in order. So I'm just going to grab a handful of clothes and then hold and look at each piece of clothing individually and really think about the last time I wore that. Think about an outfit that I would wear. We think about if I'm actually going to wear it in the future. And if it is something I wear on a regular basis or I feel like I need for an upcoming event or that I just feel like I will use again I will then put it in the keep pile. If it's something that maybe I used to love but I just don't really wear anymore and it's kind of worn out and not really in its best condition anymore then I will put it in a donate pile. And then of course I have things that I bought recently that I just never entered a wedding either they didn't fit right or just never found the right things to wear them with. This happens to me a lot like buy things think I love them and I never even end up wearing them. So I'm going to put that in my cell pile because I'm going to try to re-install those items. So it just goes through my whole closet and make up these three piles until the closet is empty. And then after that the easiest one to get rid of is the donate pile. So I'm going to take everything off the hangers and set the hangers aside. And then I just fold and put everything in a trash bag and then I try to make a commitment to myself to drop that off at the nearest thrift store or donation center that day. If I can't do it that day then I try to make a promise to myself to do it the next day and sometimes I find it helpful to actually just go put it in your car like in your passenger seat because then it's just like staring at you in the face and if you were out and about maybe you can find a donation center and go and donate it because I've definitely done this before and then like set it in a corner or like set it in my garage and totally forgot about it. And then it's still just clutter and so yeah you definitely want to make a promise to yourself that you're actually going to get rid of that donation bag as soon as possible. Another thing I've done in the past is invited like my younger cousins or my friends over and asked them if they wanted to go through my donation stuff before I drop it off. But today I'm just kind of in a hurry because I am moving soon and I just want to get rid of things as soon as possible so I'm just going to go straight to donate for that. So now that your closet is all clean and empty we can focus on our key pile and while we have all these things here I'm going to go through and put them all on the same hangers or similar hangers because this time has gone by I think so just add it up and I get lazy and I just grab the nearest hanger but I want to make my closet look really good and when I move I just want everything to be clean and organize it on the same hangers and easy to line up. So while I have everything that I'm keeping right here pal that I'm going to put them all on the same hangers and then I'm going to put them in an organized order in my closet. So just look at the space you have and see where things went to best so maybe you have a longer section that would fit dresses and longer sweaters better maybe you have a shorter section that would be better for shirts so just kind of look at your closet and organize your space like that and then within each section of dress shirt skirts pants whatever you have I like to organize it by color then so I go darkest to lightest and I just like this is really easy to see things that way and you can remember where things go and another thing I'm going to try moving forward is when I take something out of my closet I'm going to put the hanger back in the exact same place that that clothing item was just hanging so when I wash it and go to hang things back up I know exactly where each item goes and it'll still be and it's perfectly color coordinated area and I will have the right hanger available for that item so I'm going to try this and see how it goes but I'm thinking it's going to work well and I'm really excited because looking at my closet and seeing it perfectly organized just brings me so much joy. So of course I'm going to go through my dresser and my shoes and do the same thing of looking through things that I want to keep looking through things that I want to donate and looking through things that I want to sell and once I have all of my items ready that I want to sell I'm going to be selling them on Poshmark and I have been using Poshmark for years now I think like I've had my accounts it's like 2013 or 2014 and I've sold so much up on there and it actually made like a good chunk of money selling stuff on Poshmark so I'm a really big fan of it and if you've never used Poshmark I'll kind of go through and show you guys how you use it it's super user friendly and I've never had any complaints with it I really like it and really recommend it and I have a link in the description box down below to download the app if you don't already have it if you click the link and download the app you will get five dollars off your first order so that basically pays for free shipping and if you use that link then I will also get five dollars off my next order because I know this is kind of the opposite of cleaning out your closet but I've also have bought really cool things off Poshmark too like sometimes you can find like design your dresses and stuff like that in your size where I actually really like to find like Nike's and workout clothes on there too and you can search things that are like new with tags and stuff like that also so it's a really great place to find great deals as well as a great place to sell things that you don't need anymore so I'm going to show you guys how to use the app and how to sell something using this show me your Mimu dress I bought this for a bachelor at party and I did wear it but it was really short on me and it's really low cut and it was always kind of a little tight on my ribcage so I just don't really think that I'm going to use it again in the future I'd not something I'm definitely going to wear a lot so I think that if you find a better home than my closet I only wore it one time so you open the app and then you push the center button on the bottom that says sell and then if you push the coil in the corner you can upload your pictures it's best to post well lit really good quality photos so I just like to lay them on a really basic background you can model them if you want but I just like to keep them looking like really professional on a basic background you can also try to find a picture online like off the original website and upload those pictures so people can see what it looks like on a model you can choose a filter but I usually just either filter my photos separately or just leave them as is so that people can really see like the true colors and whatnot of the item then you push next you can upload up to four pictures and you need to fill in all the details so you're going to fill in a title so I'm going to put in show me your Mimu print dress and then I'm going to describe it so I'm going to try to find online what this style dress is called if I can find it what this fabric is called if I can find it and fill that in the description this dress is a size large but I think it ran kind of small like I don't usually wear a size large and it was pretty tight on me so I'm going to put that in the description so people aren't thrown off when they buy like expecting it to be a true size large I'm going to say that it runs a little small it was pretty tight on me and I'm usually a size medium category it is a dress quantity there is one size I'm going to put that in the size large even though I said it runs small because someone might know they are a size large and show me your Mimu so I just want to be true to that brand I'm going to search show me your Mimu and add that color if this is kind of like a multi color so that's going to be hard I guess the main color would be pink and then a original price this is kind of hard to remember for me most of the time I usually try to look online and see what if I combine something similar or what not and put in as close to the original price as I can find and then for listing price Poshmark recommends that you usually list it to 50 to 70% of the original price so I usually like to start higher because people do bargain with you on Poshmark a lot so I usually list it for 70% of the original price and see what the best offer I can get for it is some things I'm more you know desperate to sell than other things so that kind of depends on if I'll list it for 50 or 70% of the original price but like I said people usually always do bargain with you people will be like will you accept $50 if you have it listed for $75 and stuff like that and if you do wanted to sell it for $50 you can just go in there and edit it and change the price and let that person know that you change the price for them so that they can go and click bye and then from there it's really easy once someone buys it you get a shipping label emailed to you so all shipping is $5 for the buyer and then the seller gets emailed a shipping label and all you have to do is put your item in a box and tape your shipping label on the box and drop it off at the post office or you could just put in your mailbox but I always drop it off at the post office and it's super super easy and user friendly I've only ever had good experiences and like I said I've made quite a bit of money on there as you can see the items that I've sold so far in the past couple years like a custom pretty high ticket number sell so I'm not complaining because that's also exciting to make extra money from playing at your closet so I'm like a win-win situation to me so yeah I'm going to be posting a lot of things on post work today so if you guys are interested in checking out my shop

what my closet looked like I know kind of a mess it's just like random and not in a good place and after I have cleaned out everything and reorganized it this is what it looks like I like to hear my wardrobe pretty minimal and I that's why I go through and clean it out a lot because if I have too many things I'll forget about the things that I really do love so if I don't have too much stuff in
