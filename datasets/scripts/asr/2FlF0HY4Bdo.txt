 Okay, focus. Here we are again with another amazing use for bicarbonate of soda. Bicarbonate of soda for cleaning your headlights. Especially if you live in a hot country with a lot of sun this car can set out the sun. It hasn't been used for a year and the sun's been on the headlights so they're very, well you can hardly see through them at the minute. So very simple bicarbonate of soda. Vinegar. What's the reaction? To react together. You can pay about 50 quid, 80 dollars or something to get something to do this professionally. But actually this just does the job in much less time. Upsay the professional job looks a bit better but if you want a quick fix this is the one here. So that is literally one minute of cleaning to get it to that level. Of course I could keep going with it and get it buffed up even more. But one minute we've got about 80% of the discoloration of the headlights. Bicarbonate is so amazing stuff right?
