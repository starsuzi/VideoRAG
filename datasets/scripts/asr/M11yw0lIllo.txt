 I'm Mary Zayler, Home Economist at Whirlpool's Institute of Fabric Science. Sometimes what starts out as a fun game of backyard football ends up with grass stains all over your favorite t-shirt. I'm here to help you get those grass stains out. The first thing to do is always check the care label. Next make a mixture of water and detergent and soak the garment for up to 30 minutes. An enzyme detergent or one with bleach alternative can add to your success in removing the stain. Then wash the garment in the warmest water, say for that garment again, check your care label. Then air dry the garment, make sure the stains been removed. Did you know that dryer drying can actually set some stains?
