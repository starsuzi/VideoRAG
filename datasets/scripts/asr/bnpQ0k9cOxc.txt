 Hi everybody, it's Bridget and I'm here to share with you a little something that I found. I get from time to time these emails called everything at c.com so I you know I subscribe the really long time ago and every once in a while they send these email updates and I mean obviously you know we all know what Etsy is but I forget who this everything Etsy.com is but I will put the link in the description box for those of you who don't know it. But anyway so they were talking about this new product called It's by ModPodge and I want to say it's called Translucin but there is no actual name on the ModPodge bottle. It comes in quite a few colors and it's it's like it almost is the consistency of acrylic paint but a little more fluid and it goes on like paint it looks really thick and then what you do is you color glass with it or you stain glass with it so you pour it in the in the jar or the candle motive or you know here you pour it in and then you swirl it around and then you turn it upside down as you can see here so this is my first time playing with it so anyway you turn whatever it is upside down you wait for it to dry and then when you turn it back this is what you get this is coloring clear glass obviously in Mason jar but what you're left with around the rim you can just actually either with a razor blade or with your craft knife you can just scrape off and it's almost like the consistency of a rubber band what's left behind so anyway this is what I did I took a plain Mason jar and I poured it in and I think I used too much because this actually took two days and it shouldn't take more than 24 hours you know you swirl it around you leave it like this and then it dries and when it dries it turns into this translucent color it definitely looks like paint when you first pour it in and turn it over but then once it dries this is the result you get so you can see here I don't know what happened there but because it turned out like that I'm keeping this one for myself so you can find it at Michaels I don't know about the other shots but that's where I found mine so what I did was I lined the inside and the outside with this rosette trim that I had gotten from Arty who's one little dreamer from time to time she has these sails on like a lot of different colors of the rosettes so I think I had gotten 12 or 14 colors and then I used also this rhinestone trim that I had gotten from her at the time which I think she still has in her shop and that's what I did around here and then I used one of these beautiful bling centers from Elise and that's it I'm going to store just some either paint brushes or pens in there I thought it was really neat the way that it came out and I wanted to share it with you in case you guys have not heard of it but anyway you will make little mistakes maybe here or maybe you won't pour like almost half the bottle in the jar I don't know but but I think this is a really neat product especially if you don't want to necessarily have the other painted look like the acrylic paint sorry okay so that's that and I'll show you the bottle again it is in the spring section or in like the DIY section I didn't find it in like the adhesive or the Mod Podge section I looked I found it somewhere else so and this little bottle which is how many ounces does that say four ounces was 399 so it's kind of pricey if you ask me but but it does color clear glass really really pretty so anyway I hope you guys all are having a nice day and I will see you soon bye
