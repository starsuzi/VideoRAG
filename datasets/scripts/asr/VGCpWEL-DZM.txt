 Good evening. I'm Kimberly Edwards with cooking with Kimberly.com and it's a Bommi or new early summer evening and I'm making dinner. I'm going to make some crusted pork chop loin chops. I'm going to make some mashed potatoes and I'm going to make fiddle heads but in this particular video I'm going to show you how to cook fiddle heads. Now fiddle heads many of you may not have ever seen fiddle heads before. You can even hurt them for that matter. These are fiddle heads. I'm going to put dump them out. All I've done is I've got them at the store and I've washed them and rinsed them in a colander to get any weird things off of them and fiddle heads are actually they look like they're actually little ferns and it's all curled up like a like a snail or something like that but it's a fern. It's a baby fern I guess you could say it's a sprout of a fern and you can eat these they usually come out late spring and there's often a very very short period of time that you are able to actually buy these at your grocer and I just happened to catch them and I got a whole bunch of them because I'm going to enjoy them. I haven't had them in maybe a decade or something like that. You're going to cook them very very similarly to how you would cook maybe green beans or a spare. So you're going to I'm what I'm doing to them tonight is something just very basic. It's going to be they're going to be steamed or tiny bit boiled like there's about a cup of water in my pot that I'm pre heating in here and it should fit all of those bad boys and there's about I would say probably half a cup of water and half a cup of white wine I put in. I put about a tablespoon of butter just put in there salt and pepper just to season the water. Now what I'm doing is these oftentimes you can get away with it but right now the ends of these are looking a little bit brown or you know like they need to be cut off and that's cool that you often do that with green beans you do the same thing with the sparegust you pop off the ends. So you're going to watch me do all of these because I'm actually going to do the whole video for you. They don't take very long to cook they are very tender green vegetable I guess you could call them we're going to call that a vegetable tonight anyway. So I'm just slicing off the ends super easy no big deal my water is already boiled and that's the key the key point is that you need that water boiling that's going to be your determining factor on how quickly that you are going to be able to get these done. This is a super fast side dish it's really healthy for you and it's just something new and different it's probably a good little conversation piece as well considering we're talking about it so long. We just actually grow these in our garden when I was little my mom had a lot of different ferns that had edible fiddle heads that would sprout in the spring and she would often send me out there to go pick a bunch of them when when they were all growing and we could actually have a full meal or at least for a side dish enough of them. So these are super easy my water I already hear it boiling because there's not a lot in there you just want to steam them right there's probably a bunch of different ways to do it but this is the way that we most likely do most do it and it's the easiest way to show you guys at least to start how to use these fiddle heads. Don't be scared of new things at the grocery store if there's nothing else just take them home and do a little research make sure they look nice and fresh and figure out a way to incorporate it into your diet it's always a nice thing when you can cook something different than what you're cooking the rest of the year I mean you can get green beans you make green beans for Christmas and you get them all summer long fiddle heads are kind somewhat of a delicacy because you don't get them very often only again once a year it's only a couple weeks really most of the time I miss them and I've actually bought them in the past and had them at the house and I was all excited I wanted to do something special and I just waited too long and then they went bad so they're a type of veggie you should use quickly otherwise they're going to go bad in your fridge and it would be all for naught and that's just sad for no reason let someone else enjoy them okay I'm almost done here there's nothing to this you're just chopping off the ends simple simple just like you would the tops of green beans or you would snap your asparagus right and the dogs seem to think that they're going to like the little piece raw that fell on the floor that's kind of funny they'll just about eat anything that mummy gives them that's cool they're healthy dogs yeah I was going to show you the other things I'm making tonight and I still might do that in different videos but I like to keep it streamlined so you guys can look up specific things if ever you're looking for a recipe on the site be sure to go to the site on the top right hand side of cooking with Kimberly.com there's a search bar and you can search for different ingredients or keywords that you're looking for in a specific recipe I have tons of stuff on the site just go ahead and look or you can look through I have numerous categories that you can search through and figure out what you might want to try if you go to the Facebook fan page which is facebook.com slash cooking with Kimberly I also have albums of pictures of the stuff you can go look at different items you may want to try and next to them I always try and put a link to the recipe and a link to the video if there is one and it's easy easy easy to find so just check it out you as also a search function on the youtube channel I believe where the cooking show is it's youtube.com slash cooking with Kimberly and you can search specifically on my channel for specific recipes or ingredients or keywords okay so that's that that was easy right okay so I'm going to bring you over to my stove and then we're going to pop these in and I'm going to probably top a little bit more I'm so excited to show these to you because I might be the only person who's ever showed you how to make fiddleheads in your whole entire life it's very hard to find information on that okay so again I just have that water that water with the with the white wine boiling now you can use red wine if you like I like to use white wine most of the time when I'm doing vegetables just because it doesn't you'll take away from the flavor as much as I think red wine does you have really a strong a strong vegetable or food to stand up to that now this is already boiling water and I'm going to replace the lid I'm just through the fiddleheads in this is easy easy it should only take a couple minutes once you have it's already up to boil and what you're looking for hold on right during the fork what you're looking for is just for it to be fork tender same thing as most vegetables right it goes potatoes or or anything that you're trying to cook so still waiting for to come back up to the boil which is fine now these are so cool most people I don't think have ever eaten them so yeah it's a great conversation piece for sure and it's also a good way to get some green on your plate in summer some something new something fun that me even your kids would like it's really super easy I don't know if I'm going to make you wait this long because it's taking a little time to come back up to the boil however it's going to probably take about three to four minutes that should make it fork tender meaning grab a fork and poke it and that it just goes in and out easy that means fork tender that's simple right and then what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take it out of where all the liquid is I'm going to probably put some more butter on maybe a tablespoon a pot of butter but the butter on it salt and pepper it up I might even squeeze a little bit of lemon juice on top depending on how the white wine fared with flavoring it when you use lemon lemon often keeps it very bright green it also brightens up the flavor a lot green green vegetables can be kind of boring so you need a little bit of you know a little something to flavor them right simple okay we're back up to the boil now we're back up to the boil guys awesome let me just check out my work chops hold on I'm making sure my pork chops are nice and frosted no I didn't just get them something broke I don't know what that's live TV for you guys um yeah I want my pork chops when I make my pork chops I want to make sure they're nice and defrosted there's no coolness in them at all because I'm going to do them pretty quick I'm going to pan saute them tonight what's better pork chops and mashed potatoes and fiddleheads how cool is that right all right so we're back up to the boil I think I'm going to wrap this up because it's pretty simple at this point again this is not done but these are what they look like they're really cool they're bite-sized they're very interesting and neat and I'm excited to eat these bad boys tonight that's for sure so what is the moral of my story the moral of my story is don't be afraid of scary looking vegetables they're just vegetables they grow on the ground like everything else you've eaten all kinds of vegetables why be afraid of something that you don't that you haven't seen before what's the big deal you go home you look online you grab a recipe and you do it it's very very simple and these are really really easy and simple to start with all right everybody
