 I'm gonna show you guys how I made Scarlet's Birthday hats this year. She's having a vintage strawberry shortcake theme So we have some really pretty paper with little tiny strawberries all over it All I did was get some hats from the dollar store I'm going to reuse the elastics at the bottom of them that way I don't have to go out and buy elastic and One of the hats gets to be my template then you need stapler and some tape scissors Possibly some ribbon and then your favorite scrapbook paper If you if the scrapbook paper you've chosen is really thin like if it comes in one of those big packs instead of nice thick card stock like this Then you'll also want to buy some This is vinyl that you can get at the grocery store You usually use it to line the bottom of your cupboards and things You can just cut some of that press it over your paper and it'll make it the right consistency So that it'll stiffen up and stand up on its own But I've got some nice thick paper here so we don't need to do that so first we're gonna take the elastic Out of the store bought hat and save that and set it aside then we're going to open up the store bought hat template If you look it has these like weird little notches on the side because they just folded it together I'm just gonna ignore those and I did notice that when this one was folded up It was a little bit too narrow for me I want it to be a bit more of a wide cone So I'm just going to make my cone a little bit bigger when I cut it So line it up with your paper if you want it to be exact size as what the store bought hat was Line it right to the edge if you want to be a little bit bigger You're just gonna pull it away from the edge a bit But then you're gonna need to cut it away from the same angle on the other side I'm just gonna eyeball it. We can fix it in the end So now just follow the arc And then like I said, I want it to be bigger So I'm going to add some distance here and the most important part is that you come to a point right in the center of your arc here Otherwise, you're gonna have a lopsided hat. So hopefully I'm getting it close enough That looks pretty even to me. Okay, so now I have my one template What I would suggest doing is if if you fold this one up and it's exactly what you want Which that looks pretty good. That's about how I want it Then you want to use this template to cut all the rest of yours Line the rest of your paper up and use the new template you made to cut them out Once you have that part done Then you're going to fold your cone And if you do want to do a little princessy bit out the top then don't worry about having it be an airtight seal right at the top We're gonna line it up with a little bit of space left over Just a tiny bit there Like that and then tape it into place Start by taping it right at the bottom because that one's gonna hold the most securely Right at the bottom and fold it in Okay, and then work your way up the hat You Got my little birthday cone there and I have the little p-colle at the top So now I've got some ribbon and I've cut them on the diagonals. They have a nice um Shark point right at the top there. I'm just gonna slide that up the middle Pull it out the top Nice little princess blue Do it with the next ribbon You might want to use scissors to just help guide your second ribbon through if it gets a bit tricky Then you can pull that one up while holding the first one in place Choo choo You can do as many ribbons as you like You have your little princess ponytails now. We're gonna attach the elastic on the bottom So set your little hat off to the side And then you're gonna take the original elastic it came with and mine was attached just by some slots in the paper So I'm gonna tie some knots on the end just do double knots as close to the end as possible You want to do a double knot because you're noting it right on top of itself Just like that Do it on both sides You There we go, so I have two nice thick knots Then um we want the seam of the hat to be in the back So about the middle on either side of the seam we're just gonna staple that into place Take your knotted elastic drop it down on the inside and then you're going to staple it now You want the finish side of the staple the nice long strip side of the staple To actually be on the inside so that it catches the elastic staple near the repair hat Then pull the knot to the end just like that do it on the other side Pull the knot to the end and it's done I might add some more ribbons in there, but you have your little birthday strawberry princess hat Happy birthday parties whoever celebrating
