 I started the arc by this side. How big I wanted to make it. And I drew the base. I started with a rectangle. And then for the ends, I made a curve because that's the shape that I wanted my arc to be in. After I did that, I cut it out. Then I drew a rectangle for the sides. And I wanted that rectangle to fit around the edge of the base that I made. And to make it do that, I folded it back and I cut loose slits in it. And then when I glued it down, it would stay on the base. And I put the glue on the base first. But before you glue it, you want to make some marks in it if that's what you want to do so that it looks like the wood. And I cut little tabs on the edges so that I can glue it together. After that, I drew the little house to make the little house. And I just set the house down inside. It's not glued. But you can do this as your project. You can glue it if you want to. To make the house, again, I drew a rectangle. And then for the ease of the house, I drew a triangle. Now I made a tab on each one of these so that I could fold these tabs back and put the glue on them so that when I put the top, the roof on the house, it would stay. Now at the end of the one of these, I drew a tab so that when I glued them together, I would have a place to glue. And again, on the house, I made little marks. But like this, I just drew lines for the boards and inside of them. I just did little things like this so that it looked like lumber. I also did it there. And I put some windows. You may want to do something different to yours. And for the top of the house, I just put a rectangle, cut out a rectangle shape and folded it in the middle and then laid it on the glue where I had put the glue on the tabs. Thanks for watching.
