 Here's the pump in the motor. A little more of the motor. Some springs, drain hose. There are a couple clips to get removed for the pump. There's also an electrical connection over here. Pull up on the tab right there. A little bit of the pump to be removed. You can look for clogs, the set is broken. Be aware if you have a tub full of water. We'll use some channel locks or vise grips to remove these. Water will be coming out. Have a bucket ready. Some towels. By working these clips out from the backside back here. You can push the tabs in, get your own clips out. Just a little more range on this pump. With the hose disconnected in the pump, one can reach in. Lo and behold, feels like a sock. Train the water out slowly. Be careful not to avoid a fly. With the pump off, you can look in the pump and find the sock.
