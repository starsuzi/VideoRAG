 Ironically enough, free range is more expensive. But yeah? Why would that be our, where's the iron? Because it's not free. Oh. Oh my god. Stay tuned, I understand what the hell we're talking about! What got Macautiles? I'm your host, Eric Schoen. That's Ian Andrews. Today's episode, episode, episode, is the Amarillo Sour, submitted by Rod C. Rod, just do it. C. Okay, go with this. And the executive producer for this is Matt. The recipe is. I knew. One and a half ounces of Amarillo, we got some Vicerono. We do. Two thirds of an ounce of cask, strength, bourbon, we got some, uh, Greek. Must be cask, cask, strength, right? Ow, so lemon juice. Lemon? Pre-squeezed. Teaspoon, simple syrup. Luckily, that's about all we got in this bottle. Hey, now. And half of a, half ounce egg, what? We're gonna put a egg one in here. Did you ever get my spoon? Did we just say what the recipe was? Yep. That happened already? Yep. Okay, we're gonna dry shake. I sure. So dry shaking involves. Should I give it a nice? Oh, we don't want to do it for the reverse. Oh, we're gonna do it normal. Maybe normal dry shake. I'm gonna make a video on ford in the verse. So we can understand what that is. And we can too. When we get an argument about it. Yes. What was I gonna do? Just talk. I can do that. Oh, hey. So a few things. First off, you should go to homecockdownlady.com and download the new Carnal Spirits book that we just posted. Okay. That is something you should do right now. Secondly, check out the end card at the end of this video. I've got the new end card code that only large channels have because I'm just that good. Secondly, that was thirdly. How about it? What? I don't check that out. I'm already done. But yeah, you'll see it. All right. You can actually, if you might, I put it in my blog. Yes, that's it. I got it like literally. Is it from YouTube? Is it a YouTube thing? Yeah, it's, so unless you, unless you'll be able to click different videos at the end of the episode and you can have like a subscribe button in a Patreon link or whatever. But you can do playlists and it's you can touch it on a mobile which you can't do with the annotation stuff. I'm a legit. Yeah, I'm pretty legit. Boom! That's going to wear this. I also just don't drop the day away right in there because I don't need to flip right now. We made a drink with that already. The ultimate last week. This week, let's see. We're all a stick second here. Last week, I was at a YouTube headquarters. That was pretty cool. I got to see some big YouTubers, some couple, 800,000, put a million thousand plus YouTubers. I did some some speeches and talks and stuff about their channels. Get together with the whole community, all the flaggers, the community flaggers, the people who actually flag videos for to take down the folks that connect to the help forms, the people that connect to the community forms, which I'm part of, all over the world. I did meet a couple people who knew who I was, which was kind of cool. That's awesome. Some people I knew who I was from another show. I've been working on it for the last couple of weeks. And then, what's up? Video creators? Oh, okay. The live streams that we've all mentioned. So if you like YouTube, you'd like to make YouTube videos. You should check out Tim's Floyer's video creators. You just search it up on YouTube. And each week we have works there in season two right now and they have six full-time YouTube folks at all. Discuss video creation and challenges and stuff like that. And I'm one of the six. What, where do you do that? Is that just online? Or do you, you, you, you, you're here? I do, you're here. I do it at my computer, but it's streamed the, well, same way everybody who's watching live streamed, was watching it. I think. It's pretty bad, ours. Yep. Eric, what's my project for both of you? Live stream viewers or viewers on video? Live stream viewers don't bring in, I think they bring in approximately 19 cents. So, not live stream. It's creamy, yeah. Oh, just, what's I expectant that? With right-wing? Yeah. No, it's because of the browns. Like, the egg white doesn't make it, the color of egg. It looks like a flip. You want a gelio top? No, no, do I? Is there supposed to be? Orange, you're measuring, you're sure? We good? Yeah. Do it! We did a, um, you must have started. We did a whole video on it in the egg's bag, yeah? Oh, did you? Yeah, I think that's all that. No, you didn't. Oh, I didn't see that. We put it all in, yes? Oh, no. That's the one I wanted to do in conversation we had. I was going to do that for this weekend. Did you just move one drink? Is it in the right place? There is now. Yeah, like I should do this. Oh, look at that, it's six. Because of the foamy-ness. And the fact that there's ice cubes right there. Whatever. Whatever. Let these read. That is dessert. I really can't go wrong with that, I'm not going to. Or egg whites. Or egg whites. If you know what? Let's get some ok here. Mm-hmm. But, oddly enough, this is, missed it, 120. Two faster, yeah. Opportunity missed. 120 proof? Yeah, but there's not a lot in there. 60 percent of the amounts. Oh, maybe that's one. So there's really no alcohol in there. That's a bit like an ounce of salt. Oh, I'm right. So this, maybe they use casc straight just because they're so little, they can bring up the flavor. Because there's oaky flavor in there. It tastes like there's bourbon in there. To me, this is like a bourbon stone sour. What did that work? You don't get bourbon? You just want to keep drinking it. Let me try again. Yeah, no. No, no, it's okay now. It's good. Yeah, it's so good. It is like a bourbon stone sour, yeah. And that garnish and everything with the bourbon. You know why they call it bourbon stone sour? It's got bourbon. Yeah. I remember what the stone sour was. The stone fruit. Yes. Which is where the bitter almond comes from the pit of a nectarine. Is this from an interview? No, I knew this before. But yeah, there might be. No, no, he has never heard this. But he learned it all by watching the D.C. Aramau interview that we did at Kinsley's. Yes, I did. I learned it all there. Yeah. That's right. So you should go check that out on the channel search for D.C. Aramau. It will. It will eventually get on the show when I get everything. Yeah, Paul. Yeah, when I get everything straightened out. Which means I just have a good schedule when everything's working. I'm not flying around. It even has a nice cherry smell to it, which does. I don't even think the garnish is doing me. It's a garnish. No, that's the unripe, man. Yeah, it's just like totally. It's a sweet cherry flavor, but then it's dry, silky. It tastes the... Well done, cocktail. I like it. Question of the day. Are you afraid of egg white in a drink? I bet you there's going to be lots of yeses. Two nose. Right here. Two nose. But don't you say yes or no. I want to know why it doesn't bother you. I want to see how many people believe in myths and how many people have facts and all the other kind of weirdness that can happen in there. Or maybe you're just vegan. Is this a vegetable? Egg white vegetables. There's not a piece of countis. There's not vegan. There's not a piece of vegetarian. There's not a piece of vegetarian. What is the one where people won't touch anything that has anything to do with animals? Vegan. But... You could be a lacto. Oh yeah, okay. I thought... You could be a lacto-ovol vegetarian, which means you have no nose. Oh my gosh. What the... First off, I knew that was a thing, but I would have never come up with the name. And why do you know this information? Nobody's going to know. They have this. A head full of shit. And full of shit. That's it, my friend. These are free range eggs. Free range? Oh, that's white so good. Free range. I'm a real sour right there. We're teaching you how to drink. Oh hi. You're still here? Well why are you here? Why don't you subscribe? Check out our Patreon.
