And then I'm going to put the greens in the description box we love I'm gonna start by two head of broccoli Which I'm going to wash and after I cut it or three cups of broccoli So we're gonna cut it in a small pieces. That's the first thing that's the first The first thing we're going to do or I'm going to do I used to hear I'm gonna use more pieces and definitely we're going to use Some of the hard hard from the broccoli and that's optional if you see in there. I'm gonna cut it small piece and also But I'll stop to you If you want to use it you can use it now you can just discard Okay another ingredient is the carrots. I just want to fill the carols. You're gonna use the potato cleaner or knife And we're gonna remove the hard part and then I'm going to Use the hinge greater Or greater sorry and if you don't have it a greater you see the raider have two parts a different part I'm gonna use this part you need to do a small pieces Okay Okay out of this onion you can use either one half onion But I'm not gonna use the half I'm going to use probably half of the half of going to cut Like you see in here. I just gonna cut it a Half and I'm gonna use your only the half board, but you can use half onion And I'm going to cut that in small pieces Now I have mine onions And it's more pieces I already washed the broccoli so I have an in small pieces also and I have the carrots and the hard part from the broccoli Now you're gonna have a skillet I'm using a stainless steel So I'm gonna put my steel at a medium be careful with this. I'll say it's still Hats because they double the The the temperature So and then I'm going to add one tablespoon of butter I'm using a salted butter, but you can use salted butter if you like and then I'm going to just saute the onions You can saute the only for two three minutes probably I want to live a little bit longer Because I like it you know little bit crispy So maybe you're gonna solve say me who meeting high you gonna solve say your onions and you want to move them Occasionally After a few minutes and then you want to Have you see the onions that's what I'm looking for And then I'm gonna put this skillet by the side and And I'm going to get it Where I'm going to cook my I'm gonna put probably four tables for the butter or One four cup of butter and in here I'm using a salted butter And one four cup of just plain flour or all purpose flour We're going to cook that all purpose flour for one minute to two minute and medium don't put it in high heat Because you don't want to burn the the flour and it's very important can you cook that flour because that's gonna have like a weird Flavor in your soup. So make sure you cook it for two minutes to three minutes and a medium And then I'm using the chicken broth but Are you seeing that one you can use the one and I can or you can use your fresh chicken broth and I'm going to use two cups I used to two cups of it at the beginning but I don't really need four cups of the chicken broth Now I'm going to add the onions Then broccoli And the carrots And as you see I don't have too much liquid So I'm going to add another two cup of the chicken broth And if you want to do this vegetarian you can just add a vegetable broth or just water As you see I add to more cup Now I'm going to cook this for approximately 25 20 to 25 minutes And then I'm going to show you where we're going to do over what is gonna be the next step So before I'm gonna sprinkle some black pepper And I also gonna sprinkle some salt and remember at the end we're gonna add some cheese and the cheese already have salt So be careful when you add this salt in there So probably you can leave this off by the end and then taste it and then I just Just salt whatever salt you need This is what we're gonna use we're gonna use half and half and this is 16 ounces or two cups of half and half and eight ounces of mild cheddar cheese And if you want to add more cheese you can go ahead and add more cheese After 20 minutes 25 minutes This is what the This is what it looks like and then it's time to add the cream So when I add the two cups of the half and half And then I'm gonna let it cook for six to seven minutes And as you see you can see some chunk of broccoli you can leave it the way it is If you want a creamy soup You can add you can put it in the after six seven minutes. You can add it put it in the blender Or you can use chose those ham blender you just mash it in there and I'm gonna do them Um, I'm going to use a potato masher because I want it I don't want it too big, but I also want to fill some of the broccoli So if you see I just Get an imagined because the broccoli stuff Is gonna break into pieces. So You know it's fine to add the cheese So if you think you're gonna need that's two cups of shredded cheese. That's one package of eight ounces If you like it with a lot of cheese you can at the end I add like a handful or more cheese beside that package So that's two your taste And after you add the cheese you're gonna cook this soup for two three minutes And it's gonna be ready to serve. I'm gonna serve my with our French bread toast French bread So we just gonna let the cheese to melt And I said two minutes this way and be careful because that's so hot I'm gonna taste that for flavor And then as it the time you're gonna judge the story you can add salt paper and And then I'm out in there start from four to five people Now I'm going to make this in that part of the video, but I'm gonna go ahead and just make some Untosed To go with the um with the soup and then do in the uh french bread I'm gonna get a brown I'm gonna Add some butter And then I'm going to Hold That bread So this is a very easy recipe and it's very very yummy and it's very similar to the panera soup so So thank you for watching and I hope you guys like this video.
