 Hi, I'm Barbara and I'm here today to show you a Teenagers Room. Now, if you're like most people, your Teenagers Room is not neat, but my son learned from the best and he keeps his room immaculate. I'm going to show you his drawers. Here I have his long sleeve t-shirts and the reason his drawer stays so neat is everything is folded exactly the same and I put a label here so there's no confusion about what goes in the drawer. Coming down we have his short sleeve t-shirts and his pajamas, even his socks are nice and neat. When we look at his closet, you'll see that everything is on the same hanger. That eliminates what I call the visual noise and that way you focus on the clothing, not on what's hanging there. You'll notice I've hoaxed in two different places on the closet door. This is great for hanging backpacks and the baseball hats. Having a place to put everything means that everything stays neat and organized. Even my son's bookcase is organized and the reason why is there isn't too much on it. It's only his most select possessions. We have all the books neatly organized in size order pulled to all the same place on the shelf and a few key trophies. But my proudest moment was when he won the neatest camper trophy in summer camp. He's a chip off the old block. Till next time, stay organized.
