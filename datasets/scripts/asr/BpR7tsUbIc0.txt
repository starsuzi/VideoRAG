 If you've ever tried to get rid of wild onions, wild garlic, dandelions, any of these tough weeds with a deep taproot, you know how frustrating it can be. You've really only had two options available to you. One, a powerful weed killer or broad spectrum herbicide, which can be effective, but it kills nearly everything it touches, which can lead to dead brown spots in the yard, or two, a spade or a shovel, literally digging these things up one at a time. That isn't until now. Hi, I'm Bill Carney, creator of the Proplugger, a tool designed specifically to target these difficult weeds, and one that has the three things that I look for in any landscape tool. It's easy to use, it's effective, and it's a great value. Here's how it works. Simply place the plugger directly over the wild onion stem, step down on the foot pegs, a slight twist of the henna bars, pull straight up, it's that easy. You can pull up to a half dozen before you need to empty the plugs. As you pull them, they get stored or stacked up the shaft. When you're ready to empty, simply turn the proplugger upside down and the plugs come right out. As you can see, the proplugger gets the entire weed, stem, bulb, and roots. Once you've pulled the plugs, drop one of the proplugger, cocoa peat discs into the hole, and you're done. The discs are made from 100% organic cocoa peat conditioner. The next time it rains, are you airgate? They will rehydrate to completely fill the hole, helping to jumpstart the surrounding turf growth. Simple to use and effective, the proplugger is also a great value. It's welded all steel construction will give you years of service, and a price that's about the same is just one of these containers of weed killer. Check out proplugger.com to learn more.
