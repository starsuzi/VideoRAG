 The large and old files module in CleanMIMAC 3 makes finding space hoggers you've forgotten about on your Mac super simple. It can find large files hiding on your machine that haven't been opened in weeks, months, or even years, and lets you choose which ones to delete. By default, CleanMIMAC scans your home folder where the majority of your files are probably saved. However, you can also add other directories, such as an external drive, network disk, or any other location where your files might be stored. To get started, just click Scan. Since your large files were, at some point important to you, CleanMIMAC does not automatically select them for deletion. So when the scan is complete, you'll need to click Review Files to choose the files you'd like to delete. CleanMIMAC groups these files in a way that makes it easy to review them. You can view these by access date, size, or kind. Then just go through and find the ones you want to delete. This can be removed immediately, move to the trash, move to a specific folder, or removed securely using the drop down menu. Click whichever option you need and just click the Clean button. That's it. Now that the cleanup is complete, you may view a log of the removed items, or review items that were not cleaned with this cleanup. Enjoy a Clean Happy Mac.
