 Hi guys, it's me Melissa and welcome back to my channel Melissa's Makeovers. So last week I showed you how to make this garland and this week I'm going to be showing you how to make a shirt out of a plastic bag. So you really only need a few supplies for this. So let's get started. I'm going to make my shirt out of this bag that has the flowers on it. All right, so first up, be careful when you put it on for the first time because you don't want it to be different. Let's see, it's already very close to being exactly what I wanted to beat. Just for that, let's get a little bit. Let's try it on again. So this is the part where I'm going to start adding the safety pins. Okay, so we're ready to try it on again. Let's see how it's going. Be careful. Okay, so I think the safety pins help a lot. See that little decoration there? Okay, so the next step is going to be applying the sparkles. Now step, just adding the jumps. And that's all there is to it. This is Melissa, among us is Makeovers. Bye.
