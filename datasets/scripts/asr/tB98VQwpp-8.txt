 Hey guys, Mark here from GetMainLopster.com. I wanted to show you how I store lobster. Let's open the box and see what we got. These are one to 1.25 pounders, little ones my favorite. I feel they got the most flavor. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to store them in the fridge. The best place so they don't crawl around on each of cabbage or your butter or anything is to put them in the crisper. I also want to keep them damp so I have a piece of damp newspaper that I'm going to put right over. Now they should be good for at least overnight until the next day. Sometimes even the day after that. If you want to store lobsters for longer than overnight, the best way to do it is in the freezer. Now they'll be good for about a week. What you want to do is thaw them out and make sure they're completely thawed and it's normal cooking time. Side note, if you want the most humane way to kill a lobster prior to cooking, put it in the freezer for 8 to 10 minutes and then cook as normal. So that's how you store live lobsters.
