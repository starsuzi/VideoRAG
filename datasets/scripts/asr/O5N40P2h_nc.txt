 So here I'm just filling a container with water. That's about enough and then I take some soap, lots, I squirt it in. This is just dish soap, dish soap cleans your dishes which are steel and metal. Your car is made of steel and metal. I think it cleans my car pretty well. And then see it. There's a lot in here and then you just use that to wash your car and then rinse it off once you're done with washing it. It's a nice round motion like that. This is a really simple way to clean off your car. Spray it off with water to get rid of all of the dirt and grit on it so that when you're washing it, you don't scrape it. Now I wet the cloth like that. And I put some dish soap on it or some dish soap in a pail. And then you don't have to do this and then you just wipe it on like that. And then you rinse it off. It's really easy and it's clean. There it's rinsed off, there it's clean. It's pretty easy.
