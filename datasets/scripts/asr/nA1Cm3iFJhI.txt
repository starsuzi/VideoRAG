 Okay, so I have a cake pan with parchment and a bunch of crushed ice and I'm going to pour the sugar over top of that. Okay, so seriously it's been about 45 seconds. I guess it just solidifies that quickly. So let me see. I'm going to get ice going on my floor. But now I have really cool, again, water. And I'm going to put around some of the hideous fish that this... Well, that I'm going to put around the cake. And if it were a deeper vessel, it would be deeper coral. I think I'm probably going to do it again and make some pieces that are deeper, like in a bowl. But that's that. Okay, bye. Okay, there. It's much better focused. I don't know what that happened before. Anyway, it's got like, healthy valley. It's really cool, okay?
