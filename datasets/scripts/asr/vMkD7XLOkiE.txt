 Are you two good? That one on one with R2? Here's your air result. The branch should have be toasted after being toasted. It's not long on that heat. It's red now. There. You don't want to really touch it. I don't think it's that hot. All right. Let's just get your bread. Yeah. Place it down. Smash it a little bit. I'll wash my hands y'all. Don't treat. You think that? Right there. That. All right there. Smash it up. And that's it. That's air result. It's up for good, good chiefs. Thank you for watching. Just learning your oven for about five minutes. You're straight. If we're one one, peace out.
