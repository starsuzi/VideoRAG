 This is the Yorkshire pudding recipe. This is John's way, but I do it very similar to this. Now, first of all, we have the Yorkshire pudding tin, 12 of all, put one teaspoon of olive oil in the tin, and then we put it in a very hot oven, which is 250, to get it red hot, the oil. Go in here now, and roll out four eggs, which we beat. A pinch of salt Well, then Then you add the flour gradually, four ounces of flour. To plain flour To plain flour And I've got a full of fluid ounces of milk which I'll put some in now. The rest of the flour and the rest of the milk and mix. Now put the mixture in the fridge to cool until the fat is red hot. Okay, right, the fat is red hot, smoking hot. Put the mixture in a little bit in each. Now to me this is too thick. So important, don't open the oven door while they cook in otherwise they'll go fat. Okay. Now we turn it down to 20 once they're in the oven and then just keep your eye on them. It takes normally about quarter an hour, 20 minutes but you can see them cook in. All right, ready for the grand finale. They've been in quarter an hour and go to open the oven. Well look at these, perfect Yorkshire's. E by gone. You can't beat them.
