 Tch, tch, tch. Alright, we all know this time of the years for leftovers. So next time a relative asks you if you want to take anything home, forget the meal prep you have in your fridge, and just say all of it. Hey, Mom! The meatloaf! Because with this recipe, leftovers have never tasted so good. Let's get to it. Start with a small oven-safe dish, unless you're doubling or tripling the recipe, and start with something bigger like this right here. In your dish, add in nine ounces of turkey or chicken, and two cups of fresh or thawed broccoli. Now in a bowl, mix together half a can of cream of chicken, one container of plain, fat-free Greek yogurt, which is a great substitute for sour cream, and one cup of shredded, swish cheese. Spread that over your broccoli layer, take on another bowl that you're going to use to mix together half a package of stuffing, and half a cup of hot water. Spread that over the top of your casserole, top it with anything else you want on it like sriracha, and bake it on 350 for 30 to 35 minutes. Take a lot! Seriously, that's it. A couple bucks and a few leftovers who work all of them if you have really nice relatives or can run really fast. 30 minutes, you have an absolutely delicious meal, you can eat the rest of the week, that's macro-friendly.
