 Rolled oats and apples are both rich in fiber. With the added nutrition and healthy protein in an eggplant's best egg, this breakfast is super flavorful. Over here in a bowl, let's mix together two and a half cups of rolled oats, one and a half teaspoons of baking powder, about a three quarter teaspoon of salt, a third cup of light brown sugar, two teaspoons of ground cinnamon, and about half a teaspoon of ground nutmeg. Then we want to stir in two cups of diced apples and a quarter cup of raisins or any dried fruit of your choice. Get all those in there. All mixed together. Perfect. Now we're going to gently stir in four large, eggless best eggs, lightly beaten, and two cups of milk. And for the final flavoring, we're going to add two teaspoons of vanilla extract. Perfect. Stir that up, and now I'm going to pour it into by prepared dish. And then bake for about an hour or until it's golden brown. Hot and fragrant from the oven. Amazing.
