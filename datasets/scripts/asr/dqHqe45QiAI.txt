 Hey guys, welcome back. Today on how to live your style we're making mercury glass I love the look of mercury glass and I haven't wanted to do this one for a while so I hope you guys like it Took a little trip down to Target for a spray bottle and some white vinegar Then I went to Michaels for some Krylon looking glass silver spray paint Then I stopped by a salvation army and grabbed a bunch of different glass Voters and jars and things for all only about five bucks that place is cheap Okay, how it makes this stuff up? Now take your water and your vinegar and four equal parts then pour that into the spray bottle and shake it up Then adjust the nozzle to spray a mist Like so now before you begin make sure to remove any stickers or labels I'll put a link at the end of the video for a quick tutorial on the easiest way to remove stickers from glass Okay, now that the glass is clean take some painters tape And tape off the outside of all the glasses On this first one I give it a coat of that silver looking glass spray on the inside and then let it dry for a couple minutes The silver paint was dried to the touch Then I gave it a few spritzes of the vinegar water and let it eat at the paint for about a minute Then I took a paper towel and dabbed at the droplets and you should see the paint start to scrape off random I Took the tape off. This is what it looked like after only one coat this paint goes on very thin So it's a good idea to add multiple coats I taped it back up to get it ready for the next coat If you want a more natural look Spray the vinegar mix within 30 seconds of spraying the silver paint And you'll notice that the vinegar starts to eat it to paint right away and it kind of pools there This is where I like to just set it out in the sun to look the vignager evaporate That way you preserve the natural look of the droplets without having to get in there and mess that up with a paper towel Keep on doing the same technique adding silver and then spraying it with the vinegar mix So you get the look that you like I found that four to five coats still let light through but you couldn't necessarily make out the candle base You still get that nice ambien glow from the candle, but you don't have to actually see the candle which to me look the best I tried different shapes and sizes because I wanted to see how each one came out and they all came out different and unique There's almost no wrong way to do this. So just have fun with it I also want to try something a little bit different and I added some bright colors to the inside of these little mason jars I think it turned out pretty cool. What do you guys think? Do you like the old silver ones? Or the colored ones better?
