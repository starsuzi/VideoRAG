 For this get about 10 or 12 lamb cutlets. Now these are really yummy. Just chuck them in a bowl or something because we want to marinate them so I like to put them in first and then chuck the marinade in. Now the bowl we want to mix this marinade. Put in about a quarter of a cup of it's basically a sweet soy sauce. Then add a couple of coves, a couple of cloves of crushed up garlic, about a tablespoon or some apple cider vinegar. Now just put in some preferably fresh, grated ginger but I ran out of it so I'm just putting ground ginger in and then the amount of ground ginger is put in and maybe a couple of teaspoons or so. Then add a couple of teaspoons of cumin. Give this a nice stir or you can give it a naughty stir, it doesn't have to be a nice stir, whatever floats your boat. Now just get that and pour it over your cutlets and just mix this around so they're all covered. Now I just put this in the fridge for an hour or two. Let them marinate and then we'll cook. So just give your grill a little spade like you can do this over the stove, you can do this on your barbecue. I'm just doing it on this portable grill because I want to. All right that's smoking so I just chuck these on.
