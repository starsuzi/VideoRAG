 So tell me what this is again. Um, it's a... Don't take a picture of me. It's not, it's a video. No. Put the camera down. So, so, so... I made this really great cake because Sarah wanted a chocolate. A zucchini cake. And I guess I was in a hurry. I'm so embarrassed I can't show you my face. I was... Wait, show us real elbows. That's fine. Apparently I was in a hurry and I forgot the secret ingredient. And that is... Flower. And how are we going to fix this? We're going to add flowers to it and bake it again. Alright, let's see what happens. You just going to sit there you want? No, I didn't know it was ready. Okay, it's my sister and my birthday. We forgot to add flower to our cake. So we're going to bake it again with flowers and see which one she likes better. So good enough? Good enough! Cut out! So here we are. We just finished our CBS post for the fancy football league. And what's your first thought here? Less. How does it look? This is our rebaked flowerless, now with flower cake. It didn't like rise at all. It just stayed the same. Polkett, does it feel right? It feels like cake. It looks like cake. So is this a good way to fix a cake you think? I sure hope so let's try it. So they're open. Let's have a bite. Alright, so here's our cake. We finished it. We could get a cake. Let's see how it tastes. It looks pretty good. Nice and moist. Let's try bite. It's really good. So if you forget the flower, just take it out and quick mix it back in. It tastes great. How is it, Steli? Are you talking? I didn't want it. I didn't want it. I didn't want it. Stella, how is it? Thank you. Don't ever talk about the flower. You want more? Bye. Bye.
