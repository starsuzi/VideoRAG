 Hi guys, so today I'm going to be showing you how to blow bubbles with bubble gun. So first you need to chew it like until all the flavors gone and it's gone all soft. Because if you don't do that it you won't be able to do the bubbles. So I've been chewing mine before I started this video so mine's all gone soft and the flavors gone. So now I'm going to use the top of my mouth and the top of my tongue to flatten it down onto my tongue to make it really flat. So that's what I do now. So now I've done that now I'm going to blow with my tongue and push my tongue out when I'm blowing so like this. Like that. So I've had about five tries. That wasn't that good because there was I didn't wrap it right around my tongue. So I've got another four more tries. That one was quite good. If you didn't hear that it did pop a little bit but it didn't pop much. So I've got another two more tries. One more try. To end this video just try one more time. So yeah I hope you enjoyed my video how to blow a bubble with bubble gum. Or you could do it with chewing gum but yeah bubble gum is better and the sets arrived in those locations are then turn the light betting on. See altitude.
