 Hi, I'm Rachel Yatuzis and I'm going to show you how to clean syrup from carpet. Serup is a nasty thing to get on your carpet or your clothes or anything. It's so sticky and a lot of people have no idea how to get it out of their carpet or any fabric at that. I have some syrup here for demonstration purposes. And the first thing you want to do is remove the bulk of the syrup by blotting it with a paper towel. You really don't want to rub it because you're just going to spread it around. I say with any stain, the first thing you do is blot it because you don't want to work it into the fabric any more than it already is. Next, make a mixture of ammonia and water. This may help. Spread on there. And that's when you can blot or start to scrub a little bit since you've diluted the syrup a bit. Another stain removal method which I think works best is to mix water. With dish washing liquid. Dishwashing liquid works great for cleaning up food because it's made to clean up food. Use this mixture. Apply it to the stain. You can really start scrubbing now. You've got something with a nice surfactant in it that's going to make it bubbly. Grab it really well. Next, grab some water. This is ammonia and water like I said before. You want to grab just plain water and then spray it onto the stain. After you do that, here we go. Get some paper towels. More than this, you want to use maybe four or five paper towels and fold them up to make a nice soft pad and set a brick on top. That will soak all that up and you'll be left with nice clean carpet again. I'm Rachel Yatuzis and that is how you get syrup out of carpet.
