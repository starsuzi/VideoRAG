 Hello, welcome once again to Prodelief Channel. Thanks for joining us. Today's topic is this plant, Sansa Vietia. Sansa Vietia. Now you may recall, some time ago, Sansa Vietia was getting a lot of attention because it was supposed to generate negative ions. Whether that's true or not, this plant is very strong and easy to grow and it's always been popular. But be careful where you place your Sansa Vietia. First of all, don't place it in a cold area. If the temperature falls below, rather, 10 degrees Celsius, it will be damaged by frost so never place your Sansa Vietia in the cold. It's fairly tolerant, however, with respect to light, so long as it's not in pitch darkness, it will usually survive and can be placed anywhere that you like. Like I said that, it's almost better to have sun, so find an optimal spot where your plant looks good, but it's also bright. The biggest risk of failure in terms of taking care of this plant is watering. Sansa Vietia does not like being constantly moist and should be kept dry. Keep in mind that these leaves store water for the plants' preservation. If you water your Sansa Vietia too much, therefore it will rot at the base. So wait until it's completely dry before watering. Then when you do water, water abundantly until you see water coming out of the bottom of the pot. During the cold months of winter, the Sansa Vietia is weak and it could quickly die if it's water. In fact, from December until March, you really don't need to water at all and the plant will survive on the water. It has stored in its leaves. So if you can't raise the temperature, don't water during winter and then around April, when the temperature is consistently above 10 degrees Celsius, remember to water generously. Your plant will happily survive the winter like this. Thanks a lot.
