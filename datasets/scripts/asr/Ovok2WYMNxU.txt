 The engineers use only, thank you. Right, so this is how to get into test mode. Service mode basically on your Samsung watch machine. You don't want to press rates in option. That's everything for 0.5 seconds. Basically a quick test for a electricity so you don't trouble as when you do that because it doesn't point your water in, you also use your hands of blowing the heat. You don't want to test that. But what you do want to do is go into test mode which is spin an option on this. It's spin on the A on the ones without these extra options. Without the full list, that's the display. So spin an option. Press on. Everything lights up like a Christmas tree. Get to use the jog wheel. So let's test it in which is test mode and we're going to first let's spin mode. So this is special. S, PN and 1400. As you can see it tells you where it is at any point. So what this lab makes it do now is enter, you can also let the status mode, you actually flip between it but it stays still, stays in it. So the past test, past play. good. So some sinscenes So, passing 10. So, we've got a few wash, main wash, and finally, a few wash. I'll put them away. Yeah, for some reason, the fabric's off no one. Sure, that's very unfair to me, but it doesn't. Right, so first press. So first press of rinse is drain. Second one is eco bubble. That will show you a lot. That eco bubble comes up there. So, you're pulsed test. That's drain spin. Now drain spin this time is waiting for it to dry out. It won't spin if it's water represent. So, I'm sure. Oh, the thing is you can test separately. That's it. That's how to get into test diagnostic mode on a Samsung eco bubble washing machine. Thank you for watching this video. I hope you found this video helpful. Quickly test some of your own at home. Right, we've got dudes get back out of it. You're just turning off. We turn it back on again. It was a Zoom back to normal. Right, thank you for watching.
