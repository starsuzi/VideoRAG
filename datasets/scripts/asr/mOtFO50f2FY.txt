 Hello friends, today I am going to show you how to fold and store grocery bags. You know whenever you go to grocery stores you come back home with a lot of bags and it's always a hassle to store them neatly. Many people just end up throwing them to the trash but I would suggest that you keep them that way you can use them as little trash bags for your trash cans. So what do you do? I have a bottle of bag in here. It's very easy. I'll show you how to do it. Just straighten the ends and make the edges very smooth. Very neat. Just like this. And fold the grocery bag into half. Make it smooth. Fold it one more time. Take a smooth. So you have something like this and then from the top start folding in the corner edges just like this. So it's in a triangle shape. Just continue folding all the way until you get to the bottom. And you will be left with this end. You tuck it in this pocket and there it is. You're all done. You're ready to store this grocery bag. I will show you now what I have done. I have folded a lot of these grocery bags in the same shape. I have this box in here. Look how neatly I can store this now. All I have to do is just fold in and there you are. You can store at least 100 bags in here. That way it can be stored away in a neat place and can be used whenever you want. So thanks for watching the video. Hope this helped. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll answer as quickly as possible. Thank you for watching.
