 I'm going to do a video to show you how I cleaned the waffle iron. I just used a little cup that it came with. And you want to turn the waffle iron on so it's hot. Basically what you're going to do is just steam clean it and have two dish towels that I placed underneath it. And you want to carefully pour the water because it will start sizzling pretty quick. Okay. You can do a little less water the first time you do it until you're used to it. But that's basically steam clean itself. The dish towels, the type I have is the type that turns. So the dish towels help when you want to drain the water out. And again you want to be careful when you first turn it so you don't get splattered. And then you do the same thing for the other side. Just a little bit of water. And at this point you could probably turn it off because it's already hot enough. And I will turn it sideways to let it drain out. And usually it's fairly clean at this point. You can wipe it down. There'll be a couple little spots I may want to redo just to loosen up. You can pin on the type of batter it is. You can turn it back on if you want to reheat it. And that's it.
