 If your garbage disposal unit is making a funny noise or is not functioning properly, it's probably jammed or has some debris in there that cannot exit. The first thing you want to do is unplug the unit. Make sure you're looking at the right cord here. The cord that actually leaves your garbage disposal. Just this one here, unplug it. Then remove this plastic rubber guard here. You'll see the disposal unit right here. You're going to want to insert a stick, a broom handle, any sort of wooden rod to actually just turn it counterclockwise several times. Then put the rubber guard back in and we're fixing to test it out to see if that unjambed. Plug the unit back in. Make sure you run some water first. Just test it out. Go ahead and double check it by unplugging the unit again. Making sure that any of the debris that originally jammed it has been removed. If you see it in there now, let's you unjambed it. Go ahead and take it out. If for whatever reason, the unit fails to come back on after you do this, you're going to need to push the reset button, which is located on the side of the unit here. Just go ahead and push that red button. If it still fails to come back on, test the receptacle here. Just plug another household appliance into it. A radio, a lamp would not. Make sure that your receptacle is actually working.
