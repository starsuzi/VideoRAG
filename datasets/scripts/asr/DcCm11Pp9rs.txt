 When I was at the farmers market, I saw all these gorgeous artisanal pantry products. And it got me to thinking, what do I have in my pantry? And I realized that homemade vanilla is one of my favorite ingredients. 25 years ago, I made a jar for the house and I still have it going. And recently, I made another one for the barn. I use it all the time. It's so easy. I'll show you how to make it. Just place the vanilla beans in a jar that's tall enough to hold the vanilla beans without bending. You can start with 12, 24, anything that will fill that jar. And then pour enough vodka in to cover the vanilla beans. It'll take about a bottle of vodka, maybe a bottle and a half, depends on big your jar is. Let the jar of vanilla beans sit at room temperature for at least a month, but it's even better for six months. And at this point, you'll have two things. The vodka will have become vanilla extract, which is fantastic. But the other thing is, if you snip off the end of one of the vanilla beans and squeeze out the seeds, you can use that for whatever you're making. It'll give all your recipes that use vanilla, fabulous flavor. And also, you'll see those little flecks of vanilla seeds. So everybody will know it's vanilla.
