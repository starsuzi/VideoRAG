 Hi and welcome to Tarot movies. To move any shape to material up here in a steep area is sometimes quite hard and takes a lot of energy. Today I would like to show you how to make a very simple hoist of pulley to make this kind of work much easier. Thanks for joining me. All I need for the pulley is a rope, a carabiner and I'm using also this little tree angle which I have here on my survival belt. This simple technique is very useful to move heavy material but also in many rescue or survival situations. I hope you like it and you will join Tarot movies the next time again. Thanks for watching, cheers, ciao and bye bye.
