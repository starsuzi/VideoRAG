 the pealers we need the pealers but you know what I keep saying I need a mandolin I said the same thing two weeks ago my wife said what do you want for your birthday I want to handle it and the one that I saw in the store had blades and attachments and things and it was expensive right it was almost $100 it was about this size a little bit bigger uh-huh but it was daunting and it was one of those shiny object things I say do I need one of them yeah and you're thinking it's realistically with all those attachments I'm never gonna use it how would I even clean it but look sharper image has a mandolin sure everything that you need and it's got all the adjustments that you need if you look at this right on the side it's got a knob it's got three different sizes for the thickness and I'll show you how wafer thin that can be or how perfect and then it's also got two attachments for julienne cleaning could not be any easier this pops right up right this comes right out and that just gets handwashed easy and it snaps back in and off we go oh love it non-skid feet these can fold up so it goes right in your knife drawer okay or it's beautiful and it says sharper image on it so you know not only is it good but it'll be attractive on your counters you leave that right out and again stainless steel so you don't have to worry about rust or anything like that but let's show the reason you get a mandolin okay the reason I want it is because especially this time of year I buy big things of sweet potatoes and I like to make chips we make those in our house too and you can just throw them on a plate all right that's the first one if you're gonna can or make pickles the nice and thick perfect bread and butter pickles now we go to the next one and again watch how fast seconds oh there's nothing like fresh vegetables and fresh vegetables and then there's the second size if you see the difference right there okay now here's the ones is these are the wafer thin ones we're gonna put out for the hamburgers when the people come over we're gonna throw that in there oh yeah we'll go look at how wafer thin put that up against there look at that to that one compared to that one just beautiful and in seconds and you know when I look at that I'm sorry I'm talking with I think of chopped salads I think of all of those kinds of things and again it takes so much time to do all of the cutting and all the chopping but you let the mandolin do it for you look at how fast look at it beautiful we miss it you have to do that again yeah I'll do it again okay now here's another thing your fingers do not have to come close to this because it's got this beautiful protector right here with a plunger that feeds it down in there so in seconds you've got those perfect slices like literally if you are listening to us but you're not looking at your TV I really want you to come over and see how fast Tim is going through these vegetables okay now I want you to see this because we're gonna be making stuffings we're gonna be making salads for people we're gonna be making all sorts of things throughout the year tuna salads and in seconds oh my gosh look at the celery and this is a task I do not like to do I don't like to chop celery yeah I do now yes I do know that I have this all right now this gets exciting you want I just made a stir fry for the family the other night okay so I broke out the zucchini and this is where the julienne comes in so you want to make sure that your julienne is the right size that's the small one I did the bigger one so look at that how quickly yeah and you get fresh vegetables if it's easier to cook fresh you're gonna eat fresh right now what else should go in there okay I don't know maybe a little bok choy ah low-bok joy so now we've shredded some bok choy okay we do some carrots while it's making our small julienne on here okay we put that on there for there he is right you just turn the knob right there's no other attachments little plates and things like no but again if I wanted to shred some carrot in there yeah we're in right and maybe a little yellow zucchini we're in and we're in and look at that how quickly we've made a stir fry and notice how everything is the same size so that now means it's gonna cook evenly it's gonna cook evenly you don't want the bigger pieces the smaller pieces and then nothing's done the same summer undercooked summer overcooked look at how much you've etched how how much Tim has been able to just chop and and use the mandolin how quickly whenever people come to your home and and they come into the kitchen you're preparing food and they say is there anything I can do to help you what do you always have them do cut up this cut this do this now you can just use the mandolin and it's so easy and it's sharper image you get the mandolin which is this and you get the food holder so that you're never gonna grate your fingernails again or knuckles again you and I talked about this as well my guests have been coming over and my wife and I have been giving them what we call spa water yeah so we've been giving them these fancy glass of water so we've been doing this prep work and cutting up lemons in perfect sizes as well and putting them on the side of the glass or put a couple down in the glass and off we go but we're doing it in seconds so that prep work is just going away all right let's julienne some more eggplants you can see how beautiful this is look at this you're gonna make a recipe with egg planting and throw this in your stir fry right look at that are your vegetables on yeah there's your there's your eggplant Parmesan right there in second in second and it's hard like if you had to go and try to find the right knife and get on the cutting board and do all of that think about how much time you would have wasted when Tim was able to just go through it and he's done by the time you think about it it's done and because again it's sharper image you know that it is made ergonomically the way that it it's not even straight it's curved so that it's more comfortable to you absolutely now I'm getting a little crazy here because you normally leave the stem on this but to make your cold sloths around the holidays to make your salads seconds if I put that on the thinnest measurement right there right grab our red cabbage okay check that out how quickly it flies through that look at the cabbage my oh my family has a secret red cabbage recipe oh and that is gonna melt in your mouth you throw a little sauce in that my family uses red wine vinegar right a little bit of brown sugar delicious but that was a task I didn't like to do right and that's a thing this is the task that nobody likes to do that's why there are things like these like mandalins and when you go to restaurants and see the pros and the chefs in the behind the you know behind the curtain in the kitchen this is what they're using do you really think they're standing there chopping all of those onions and doing all of that by you know one at a time they're going through it just like this just as quick here's another just like this if you see look how beautiful and simple and easy that is to do those perfectly the same you're gonna make your fajitas are put out a ring yeah beautiful look at how pretty and it's and it's every time it's perfect every time look at that so we're crazy about this the in the fact is it is a holiday price it's $24.95 I think it's a very small price to pay for so much this is like extra an extra sous chef in the kitchen for you and if you're shopping for gifts for somebody in your life who likes to cook who likes it maybe cut up and make chips with their potatoes this would be it's a $25 gift that they are going to use and every time they use it they're gonna thank their lucky stars that you gave it to them you and I talked about this I've been making the fresh chips around the house for the kids you can just put these on and bake these and they're all the same you don't have to fry anymore if you don't want to but if you just throw those on a baking dish wafer thin like that or look at that look at how thin that you can julienne those and make fries I made matchsticks the other day the match stick fries yeah or you can take a potato and just make them the other size I just run out of potatoes and the thing is this is what I like about that is when you get a I was gonna say a hankering I don't know where that work from when you get a hankering for potato chips and it's 10 30 at night and you're not gonna run out to the store to get a bag of chips but you have potatoes in at home you can cut them up pop them either in the we've got a worn fryer coming up in just a little bit or I even put them in the oven and bake them and it's perfect every time the next time I get a hankering I'm gonna switch these out because I'm just hankering for a new one so I just I just gum that up here's the other thing I've been doing as well the the citrus the hankering is gonna throw me the entire time the word of the day I got a hankering I just got pepperoni on my hand there in the midst of my hankering all right another great garnish another great thing we've been making around the house a lot lately or is that an orange it is an orange and look how fresh and beautiful those are perfectly even every time and cut in seconds literally seconds at a half right you know what if you want your kids to eat more fruits and vegetables cut them up and you do it and you make it fun and easy and quick look at look at that juice that's coming out off of that and this you drop in and glass of water absolutely look how fancy that looks and it tastes delicious and if your water looks and tastes delicious look at that you're gonna drink more water you're gonna drink more water and you know we put in a lemon and now you've got an entire citrus thing going on there oh how perfect tastes like stir fry too which is really good for you how perfect is this now remember you're getting the mandolin I've got orange juice all over myself but you're getting the mandolin you're getting the food pusher and again sharper image so you know it is great quality it is stainless steel easy to clean you just kind of rinse it out wipe it down and you're done $24.95 is the price now this is so this is it for this morning I know that you're gonna be back maybe later I'll say definitely tomorrow morning yes okay so we'll see more from Tim stay on the line for your mandolin or your peeler
