 Morning everybody! So today we're just gonna go through how I do my favorite white chocolate mocha keto bulletproof coffee which is absolutely amazing and nobody should have to suffer through all the horrible ones on Pinterest because I tried and I gagged down like a quarter of it and you all have to excuse my deeper voice because it is literally the morning and you're literally waking up with me and we're gonna do it that's why I got my little baby hairs going on all that fabulousness Eva say good morning and there's little bully and we're gonna make us some coffee alright so we got the curie going on and I just see his regular old any coffee whatever works for you that you like and then I'm gonna do I usually do the Ted ounces because I have three kids I need a lot of coffee alright then we'll let that do its thing now to go through the rest of it is more than just butter in there so I use coconut oil and then I put a little bit of the Hershey's cocoa powder just the unsweetened one it's got three carbs for one tablespoon I only use one tablespoon but I definitely think that helps give a little bit of just a little bit of something in you you know they just a little bit of carbs to help get us going in the morning and I think that what's what helps it make it so that I can go all the way until lunchtime without needing anything else so that miss and then carry gold butter you don't really want to make sure to get the pure Irish butter the carry gold but there's always been the one that's been recommended and you can just get it your little Walmart safely anything but don't just go do an regular butter you want the one from grassbed cows that's part of the whole point keto so definitely just get the carry gold pure Irish butter you can go salted or unsalted doesn't matter whichever works for you this is one of the biggest keys to it in Walmart you can get the sugar free vanilla or sugar free s'mores but if you go on to Amazon or on to Toronnie's website itself you have so many choices of the flavors of sugar free syrup like there are a ton you're not just stuck to those two so I get white chocolate syrup I also love the sugar free salted caramel like to make me a little sugar free salted caramel mocha but these make it so much better like don't suffer if you don't need to and then heavy whipping cream which helps gives helps to give us more fats and then you know because the mollusk extra I want to feel like my mocha's fancy in the morning so coffee's all done brewing here's the butter it's in one tablespoon of course it has to be the end the papers difficult to get out so I like to put that first in let it melt a little bit while you're getting everything else in there and then next just so we can again let it melt some is the coconut oil you can really do any coconut oil but I do like a hundred percent organic origin and the cold press unrefined because it's a little bit smoother but really honestly any coconut oil is going to work so we do one tablespoon of that now again the whole point of a bulletproof keto coffee is one to get you your extra oils and and also fats like a lot of people that are on keto the number one thing that I hear is that I have trouble getting the amount of fats that I need well if you're using doing your coffee the way that you should you shouldn't have any problems with it so one tablespoon of coconut oil in there just gonna have to and do it it does not look fabulous so don't get you know get all freaked out or anything you're going doesn't look spectacular there and then next thing we're going to do is the sugar-free syrup so again you can mess with it and do any concoction that you want but the key is like don't feel like you can't have flavor in your stuff like just because you're on keto or just because you're watching your like what you eat and stuff that doesn't mean you can't have any flavor in there you're sugar-free syrup is good to go so I do three three tablespoons of this because I like it a bit sweeter if you like the more coffee flavor then go to tablespoons and try it out and mess with what works for you right then we're going to do three tablespoons of the heavy whipping cream oh and we're also going to do some tablespoon of the Hershey's powder and make it a little extra chocolatey and give me a little bit of carbs so I'm going to grab my KitchenAid immersion blender you can also put it in any standard blender but honestly like I used to do that and I used to have to wash it every day and mom on the go I'm kind of washing my blender every day so I got this the KitchenAid immersion blender and you can get it like any brand I just love the main green um and it makes your life so much easier so just put it down in you don't believe it in there for a decent amount of time just because it really wants it all up and you get that really just focus smooth flavor to it it's delicious it nobody needs to be suffering all right yeah you see oh good job okay the last thing just a little bit of whipped cream you can leave it off if you want to as a matter I just like it because it makes me feel special and then that is it we got our coffee all right so um any questions drop them down below I'll be happy to answer and thanks for living through my you know morning attire bebe'sy say bye bye bye bye bye bye bolly all right we're gonna go get ready for the day cheers
