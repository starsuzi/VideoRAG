 Move, Fabboy. No move, stay, stay gold. I was underneath this couch. I was just playing... Damn game. Stay. Right there, right there. Right there, I don't know if you saw it. It's the damn town. Well, I can see nothing. Stay gold, dog. Right there, right there, right there. Oh shit, no! Damn it. Right there, right there. That's poisonous, right there. That's freaking poisonous. Yeah! Are you going? Okay. These things, if you want to step on them, it takes forever to kill them. So you gotta find something like where they're edge. So your kid just cut off his head. And then you can just go to the other side. And then you can just go to the other side. And then you can just go to the edge. So your kid just cut off his head. I forgot what I used to use to kill these things because they haven't walked in. Let's see. I don't know what to use, I forgot. Yeah, look at these things. Matt ugly. Matt ugly with it. For no reason. Oh shit! Yeah! Yeah, look at them. Dude, chill. Just relax. Okay, you're gonna beat that pretty damn soon. Where the hell did my wife put the rating? The rates, Freight. Okay guys, I'm sorry but, I gotta stop recording now. Okay? I gotta, I gotta really kill this thing. Thing bites me after I go to the hospital so I'm back. Okay, why did I find the race spray? Let me see if I can cut up his head. I'm just gonna stomp this. Yeah, I really hope I don't get bit. Look at these things. Matt ugly with it. Let me see if I just spray it for now. This thing's messed up. Shit. You dead, Nick? You trying to play dead? No, I'm not watching. What are you going? Hmm? What are you going? Nah, Nick, you crazy? Make him a little dizzy with that spray. Make him get tired. Just keep him over here. That's not that best spray. Nick, I can't even slow down. I don't think maybe, I don't know. Yeah! Shit. Nick, they made tricks. Nick, they made tricks. Oh my god. Yeah! There you go. That's what you gotta do. Cut off this head. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. That's what you gotta do. Cut off this head. See that? But obviously his body still goes. That's just the nerves. There you go. There you go. That's how you basically kill a sense beam. That's the tail. Where's the head? That's the head. That's the body. Oh god, I gotta get this thing out of here. Because the red spray is really... I smell it. If you ever wanna kill these type of things, you ever go see a house? Get the edge of a can. At least a long one. So it doesn't bite you. And boom. Slime cut off his head. And cut off his tail. And that's all you gotta do. Don't try to stop on it. The skin is really hard. And it could be a possibility that it could bite you. And you get poisoned. The teeth is smooth. So you no matter what the nerves... Still reacts. Still reacts even though when you cut off his head. Anyway, I killed it. And that's that. And that's how you kill it. Peace.
