 Today I'm going to show you how to make a wine glass charm using a 30 millimeter hoop that you can find at any store that sells beading, some metal charms, some glass beads, and parapliers. The first thing that you're going to do is you're going to take your metal hoop and you're going to add on about five beads of the color of your choice. Next what you're going to do is you're going to add your charm and then you're going to add five more beads. The next thing that you're going to do is you're going to take your pliers and you're going to bend the metal about the width of the pliers to a 90 degree angle. Then you're done. These make great gifts for the holidays or just a great hostess gift or for your favorite wine lover.
