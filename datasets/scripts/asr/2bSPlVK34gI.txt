 Hey guys, it's Shannon. Annapal. And today we are joined by the Builder Bear Workshop at Minibair Plush. Awesome. This is pretty cool. So the nice people that just placed sent these over to us, so we can take a look at them. So they're called the Minibair Plush, but you can get a unicorn too. So it doesn't show you the characters on the little box here, but it does show you up there. We're looking for a monkey, a puppy, a unicorn, a tiger, and two bears. And a panda. Wow. So pretty awesome. Now I really like these little packages because it resembles the packages like if you actually go to Builder Bear Workshop and make a stuffed animal, you could bring it home in a box like this, which I think is awesome. So we're hunting for the full set today. We have seven packs here. They're seven to collect. So hopefully we have all of them. I hope so. So I'm going to go first. All right. Let's see. You have to rip this. How do we open it? And you might need a rip. It's like all tape shut. I kind of didn't want to rip it. Now, if you're careful at home, you can actually probably save these for your character. I think let's see. Can you open the bottom? Maybe. No, it's all sealed too. Okay, so we're going to rip ours just so you guys don't have to sit here all day watching us open them, but you can pull all this tape off that's now stuck to me. And then you can save your little box. Ooh, it's playing bag inside. Nice. Do you know who we have? I know who you've got. We have super strong plastic. I like this as mini peluche. You use some. Tears. I like peluche. We have the rainbow tiger. Hello tiger. Or the Tigray arc and CL. So he has a little build the bear logo right here on his paw. He has really soft fur. Like the plush is really soft. The embroidery is really nice on these. He has a cute tiger tail. He has really awesome. I like this one, the rainbow tiger. Nice. Okay, I really want to get the blue panda. All right, feeling lucky. I feel like this is a blue panda box here. Okay, good luck. Thank you. All right. Hmm. It's really free and bowie. Did you get a blue panda? I don't know. It's really tough box. It's white. I think I got the blue puppy. It's blue and white puppy. Whoa. I got the rainbow unicorn. That is a rare rainbow unicorn.
