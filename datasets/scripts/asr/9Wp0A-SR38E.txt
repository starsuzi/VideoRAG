 Patanit the Cable 4 Front Stitch For this tutorial you will need a pair of knitting needles, a cable needle, and a ball of yarn. Special thanks to our sponsor Imperial yarn for providing today's yarn. Today we are using their air in line in the Color Denum Dusk. The Cable 4 Front Stitch is a common cable technique that consists of four stitches where the first two stitches are then swapped with the last two stitches. And any time that you have a cable that says a specific number, that is the total number of stitches that the cables worked over, not the number of stitches that you will take to twist with. We are only working two stitches at a time. Now the result of this twist is a left-leaning pair of stitches. So it will look like you are twisting to the left if you are right-handed. So let's show you how we make this stitch. Step 1. We are going to take a cable needle or double-pointed needle and we will slip the first two stitches off of our main needle onto the cable needle. For step 2, we are going to hold those two stitches in front of our work. Step 3. We are going to take our working needle and knit the next two stitches off of our main needle. Step 4. We are now going to take our working needle and knit the two stitches off of our cable needle. Okay, and then we can set our cable needle off to the side. I'm going to show you how to do this one more time real fast. So let's knit over to our other swatch or panel here. So again, we'll take our cable needle, we'll place the first two stitches from our main needle onto the cable needle and hold that in front of our work. Then we are going to knit the next two stitches with our working needle. And then we will knit the two stitches from our cable needle. And that's how we knit the cable for front stitch.
