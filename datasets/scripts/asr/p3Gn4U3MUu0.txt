 That's all I've been here. I'm going to show you how to eliminate without any pesticides or any harm to yourself dig a wasp. These insects are almost impossible to get rid of. I tried everything that was recommended and it didn't work and then I came up with a solution on my own. The dig a wasp returns to the nest approximately around sunset. It is also where it lays its eggs and an easy solution which I've used and it's worked over two years. I haven't seen one of them. I have to dealing with them for five years is to simply get yourself a set or a bag of long goffties and you wait approximately till 10 o'clock at night and I'm going to show you right here in a second and you take the gofft teag and you put the tea all the way in the hole. Now you would say well they dig a wasp. They're going to dig out. Well the only problem is the insect only knows one way in and one way out. It's not a human. If you were pinned into a tunnel you would say okay let's dig 10 foot to the right and then dig straight up. Well humans possess what's called reasoning. At least some of us do. Insects don't. So basically you'll never see those wasps again. Any eggs that will lay down there will never hatch and your problem is is totally controlled and you will eliminate all of them on your property. This is Matt Sullivan giving you some helpful hints on how to naturally get rid of dangerous insects.
