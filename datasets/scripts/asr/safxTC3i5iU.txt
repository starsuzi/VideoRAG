 Cut it just beyond the center. And you want to use the half without the center. So this one you throw away. Right now you begin slicing. If your knife isn't sharp enough to do this, don't worry. You can just get it sharpened. I've made a video of how to sharpen knives. It's extremely sharp. The link is just here on the top left corner. Now you just draw the end. Now what you do is you start to separate them out in a line. It's very important to have an equal distance. You want to have the end of one side meet the end of the other side. You just can clean it right around. Like so. So once you've got the ends to meet and there's still a big hole in the middle. Which you want to do is cut the hand round it and it will press it. And then what will happen is the center will do this sort of vanity. And it will be a very beautiful piece of decoration. You're going to know that. Beautiful. Now you can add this to any sushi plate and it will just look stunning. You can put like a sushi roll against it.
