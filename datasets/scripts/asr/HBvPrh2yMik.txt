 We've done a lot of pizza on this channel. We even put pizza in a bag. But we've never deep fried a pizza. Really? Feel like we've done that before. Do we have a pan or a deep fry or large enough? Is anyone? How are we going to do it? I think we can figure it out, guys. And also make sure to get the shirt at shop.healthyjunkfru.com. It's diet joke, not diet coke. It's also a very comfy feel. I can't. I'm holding a pizza. Stums up this video for pizza. We are currently deep frying something crazy. There's nothing more glorious than leftover pizza that looks cold. That's what you need. How do you find a high pot new soup? What's the equation? A squared plus B squared equals C squared. Yeah. High pot new soup and a pizza slice. If the pizza slice is the same. High pot new is found off of a right angle. These aren't right angles. Plus since it's curved around the outside. I bet pie is involved. To pizza pie. Oh yeah. I love pizza flower. Guys this is not vegan. But it could be. Guys this is not gluten free. But it could be gluten free. Alright, that's beautiful. Now just do that eight more time. Do you remember the first pizza thing we ever done? Was it that time that we made that pesto pizza? No. It was the flatbread version. It was pizza hot. And you used like whole grain everything for that. I mean back then we literally didn't use real bacon. We only used turkey bacon. Turkey bacon. And turkey bacon. And turkey bacon. But I still like turkey bacon. We worked at Domino's for a day. Yeah you and Ramon you guys like each other. I got to make my favorite pizza. I was so happy. I like that local New York style slice. I think essentially what we're doing is we're creating memories. Memories through food. Memories give me the strength I need to proceed. The strength I need to believe. I feel like this episode is almost turning into a clip show. Hey guys this video is sponsored by Audible, our favorite service. We're always on it. Getting ready for the summer. Getting inspired.

What do we do? Put it in hot oil so it can blister and get golden brown and delicious. Pizza goes in the deep fryer. From the deep fryer it goes onto this rack. From the rack it goes onto the stone. From the stone it goes into the oven. Flip that. Pizza's coming out. Onto the rack. Onto the pan. Next one going in. Onto the rack. Onto the pan. Pizza slice number three. Nice. Pizza slice number four. Going in. Guys, I went to honestly do this with a frozen pizza. Wanna do it? You got me a frozen pizza? I did. I love you. Do you wanna deep fry it? Yes. For slice flip. Onto the rack. There's a way to elevate the elevated pizza. Slice number five. You looked the best. Slice number six going in. I think that's the sixth one. I lost count. Three minutes again. It's like groundhog day. Slice number six on the rack. It's like groundhog day. Onto the pan. Is this pizza turning you on? Slice number seven. And eight. It's totally fine. It's chunky part. It's okay. It's not. Chunky part. I'm gonna have less. Who needs a chunky part? 22 seconds. Seven on the rack. Eight. Seven on the pan. And final. Eight. On the pan. Does it fit? We've got our pizza. All these slices. All deep fried. We're not done yet. What we're gonna do after this is gonna be next level. You know what you should put a big old bite in that little butthole crack in the middle. Don't talk about the butthole. What do you think? I think that's great. I think that's looking good on cams. Cams goes. Real words. This is the best idea we've ever come up with. I probably would have said no to this a while ago, but you have convinced me otherwise. Alright guys, we're going on with the pepper rim. Why didn't you put them on before? I'm glad you asked because they're greasy. They should be unlike pizza hots menu. Deep fried pan pizza. After 20 minutes, our pizza has finished. Oh. Oh. This is the greatest thing we've ever done. Deep fried and tiger pizza. You can do this with pizza hot. Dominos. Friendlies. Friendlies doesn't have pizza. Papa don'ts. I felt like it has been into a big, beautiful woman. The entire pizza is fried and JP loves it. I absolutely do approve. There's must be shared. They won't even know. They won't even know. Let's go. It's so awesome. Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm going to divorce the wife and I'm going to marry this guy. You're going to divorce the wife. You just said that on YouTube. She don't watch it. You wouldn't know it was deep fried unless you watched the video. Then you would like you know it's deep fried. Based on that side you would. What's the weird thing that I might not approve of that you're going to do next? We should do 100 layers of pizza. And what we should do is we should actually just let this set and then fry that. And then put toppings on that. And then fry that. And then put toppings on that. Do you guys want to see us do that? Let us know in the comments. If this video gets 100 million plus likes then we'll do it. Well I'll do it if they get no likes. Alright we got over Zellis. We had to fry the pizza and then fry the pizza. So that's a double fried pizza. Mmm. That's so good. Ooh. It's crispy. Oh man it looks awesome. Oh. We got to actually cheese on top of it. It's like a pizza mozzarella stick. But it's so much more. Ooh. Just a tip. And then we're going to put some white for the health of it. Now it's next level. Now double breading actually makes us seem like the breadings we come from across. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. It's good. This is wins. This is the next level hot pocket guys. Oh my god. I'm a below and let us know what other pizza stuff you want us to make because we're not done. There's so much more pizza stuff than we had. Like a pizza, luminated, pyramid triangle. No. Fry chicken crust pizza. Pigs in a blanket pizza. That was really good. I'm not even joking. Like I've been into that and it was like so much better than the other one. Because the sauce went on top of the deep fried kind of made it a little bit soggy. That's why. Yeah. So. This whole thing was crunchy. So definitely going the double batter out is the best way. The whole batter.
