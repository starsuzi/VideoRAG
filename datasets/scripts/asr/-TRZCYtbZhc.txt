 Next up on copycat.com a Starbucks white chocolate mocha Hi everyone, this is Stephanie Manley with copycat.com today I am going to show you how to make a Starbucks white chocolate mocha. This is a fantastic drink that I know you're gonna love and guess what? You can make it at home from scratch for so much less. So here I have about a cup of milk heating in my pot and I'm gonna let this get warm and I'm gonna add about three tablespoons of white chocolate chips in here and we're just gonna melt these in. This will kind of stir this up. So these chocolate chips will melt and this is what's gonna make our white chocolate sauce. Now you can buy this pre-made if you like. It's completely up to you and I also have right here one cup of espresso coffee that I've already made. So we'll add the white chocolate sauce to this when it gets heated up. Okay, so we have heated up our milk and our white chocolate chips together. So this has gotten a little bit thicker. Let's kind of see right there. And now we're gonna pour a little bit of this into our coffee. You can pour as much or as little as you like. It really depends on what you enjoy. So I'm gonna pour some of this in. You all right? Very good and right here. And if you like you can top this with whipped cream. It's really easy to do. I just have some ready whip right here. And now we can taste this.
