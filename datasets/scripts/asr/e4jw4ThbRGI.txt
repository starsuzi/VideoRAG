 Hey everybody, today I've got a great quick tip for you from Donna Blakely. She's an awesome fan of mine on how to remove hard water stains from your faucet. So let's jump into that quick tip. I think you're really going to like it. Let's do it. Grab some vinegar. In this case, I'm going to be using Heinz cleaning vinegar just because it's a little bit stronger. And here are the hard water deposits on my faucet handle. So what I'm going to do is test the vinegar using a Q tip. What do I mean by that? So I'm going to dip the Q tip into the vinegar. I'm going to place the Q tip onto the faucet and let it sit for about five minutes. Just has to make sure that it won't discolor the faucet handle. Then I pour the vinegar into my clean sink, place a paper towel into the vinegar and wrap that vinegar soaked towel around the faucet handle. Let that sit. So what you're going to do is let that sit for about 15 minutes. Time it. All right. So time put it on a timer and pull the towel off after that 15 minute timeframe. Wipe off any remaining deposits on top of the faucet and also in the set screw hole. Because oftentimes the positives get put into the set screw by drippy hands. You know what I mean? Take a wet paper towel and wipe off any remaining vinegar. Then use a regular towel to dry off the faucet handle and you're almost finished. Take a look at the results. Pretty sweet, right? All the deposits are gone and the faucet handle looks brand new. Well, there you go. That's how you remove hard water stains from a faucet. I hope you liked this video.
