 Over time as you can see your vinyl becomes cracked and distorted by the sun. The sun is very harsh on vinyl. Although it will last up to five to seven years. You want to remove that and maybe possibly get a new one. What you need to remove is just some Windex glass cleaner type stuff, a razor blade and a rag just a wipe off. So first all you want to do is just spray the decal a little bit with some Windex. Just grab your razor blade and it's as simple as scraping it off. Should only take just a few minutes. You'll have to do this two times once just to get off the main decal. And then as you can see it leaves just a little bit of residue behind. So all you want to do is just spray that one more time. Take your razor blade again. And just scrape off the adhesive that's left over. Once the adhesive's gone. Just take your towel. And wipe over work with that. That's it.
