 Okay, what I do here is I start with a bag. This is about a 10 pound bag. I go over here and I weigh up for 10 pounds. I usually scoop like five big scoop. Five, some of them scoop one as full as I thought. So it may be a little light and I weigh them. Well, it's right on. It's 10 pounds even. So that's 10 pounds. And what I do is I take it and I won't get this bag. And pour it in there in the hopper. And once I pour it in there, I will put a bag here to catch them. And I got this screen that knocks out all the shells, all the little bit of shells that we don't want. It makes your bag a little lighter but you don't have to go through all the shells and get make a big mess. So then I turn on the machine and it finishes up one at a time. It picks up one at a time and carries them over and it will crack one at a time. It cracks and as they come down and I can pick up the bad ones, go them away. And the good ones, I just let them go down and back into the bag. And it eliminates a lot of the little dirt and all the rust and little bit of rocks that they make pick up. And that's how you get 10 pounds. And then I just let them go down and I will put them in there. And then I will put them in there and I will put them in there. And then I will put them in there and I will put them in there. And then I will put them in there and I will put them in there. And then I will put them in there and I will put them in there and I will put them in there.
