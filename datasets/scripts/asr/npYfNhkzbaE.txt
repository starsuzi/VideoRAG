 When you're getting into unresponsive yo-yoing where the yo-yo doesn't come back up automatically when you pull on the string One of the most important techniques for you to learn is your bind and so we've made another video all about binding that teaches you all The different techniques and kind of the mechanics of how the bind works in this video What we're gonna do is I'm just gonna show you the what we call the easiest bind ever and this is not a bad bind to learn When you're getting started you might want to progress from that into some of the binds we showed in the other video eventually But but this isn't a bad place to start So I'm gonna show you one on the front mount and one on the side mount and hopefully this will help get you over the hurdle of binding right in the beginning So what we've already showed you in our other video is If you're on the front mount you're just gonna get off and Get the yo-yo on the string on the opposite side and do your bind from there and this bind is very similar to that Except it takes out a couple of steps. So all you're gonna do is take your first finger from your opposite hand And you're gonna push into this string towards yourself and You're just gonna hook the yo-yo with the string on your yo-yo hand right underneath it And you're gonna pinch this string right on top and pull up just a little bit and as you pull you'll start to feel the string Wind around the axle a little bit when that happens just pull down with your opposite hand and pull up with your yo-yo hand and let the string off this hand So again, you're just gonna hook it underneath Pinch the string here when you feel it tug drop your hand let the string go with your opposite hand and the yo-yo should bind and come right back up Pinch Lift let the string go so that's as simple as that you can do the same thing on the side mount So again, what we already showed you in our other video is to just get the string here and you can do your bind But an easier way if you're just getting started is just to take your yo-yo hand and bring it right under the yo-yo right here Same thing you can pinch lift You can drop your opposite hand let the string go. It's exactly the same as the one we showed you on the front mount So again just come underneath You know pinch the string lift up a little bit drop it and it's as simple as that So hopefully these techniques will help you get over that initial hurdle of binding so you can get into your Unresponsive tricks once you get a little bit better You can perfect the binds that we showed in the other video and then you'll be well on your way
