 Alright, so what we have here is a whirlpool side by side refrigerator. This is the bottom. This is the cover that comes off. You have to open both of these doors here. And then there are these kind of alligator clips right here that snap in the top. It just pulls off. There's no screws on this one. So you know, I'll take that off, push it to the side. And what you're looking for is this bolt right here to level your refrigerator. On the backside are the wheels. You probably cannot see that because of the lighting, but there it is. And then of course on this side here's your water filter and then you have the same wheel. Now you want your refrigerator to be level and you want it to be approximately a quarter of an inch higher in the front. So if this is your refrigerator looking from the side, you want it to be a quarter of an inch. So they have to be exact no, but it definitely needs to be higher in the front than the back, which is why these are designed the way they are. So when you tighten this, this way, this bolt, which is a half inch bolt, it pushes the wheel back this way. And it causes the refrigerator to lift up. So if you look at my refrigerator, it's a little bit off. And the reason is is because this bolt is farther in than this bolt. You can probably see that visually. So this needs to be tightened this way. I recommend using a half inch socket wrench. And you simply just stick it on here. And you're going to tighten it. It's not hard to do. It doesn't take a lot of strength. But what will happen is this is probably going to take about 20 turns here. I don't want to make the video longer than it needs to be, but you'll notice that the bubble is moved a tad bit more over to the left. So then when you're done, make sure you stick it on the top of the refrigerator. Make sure it's a quarter of an inch or more. Your door should close nice and even. You shouldn't have a lot of squeaks. And the refrigerator works optimally. Don't forget to put your cover back on. And that is how easy it is to leverage your refrigerator. Look for those screws. Make sure you have the right socket, quarter of an entire in the front.
