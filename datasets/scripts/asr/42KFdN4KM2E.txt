 Okay, but when you put the hook one in the middle, what you would do is if you were building your blocks of armor You'll see that now That box will take it to there and you better open in okay, so You can always spread the pair around and so it decided to walk more stability. Don't have them all on one side having my bolts, but okay What do you do? You should have a pair around approximately every six to eight blocks You should have a pair and then you should stagger the pairs from one side of the wall to the other however you can say that The best way to do it is to put the pair on either end on the first side of the wall So that way the pair won't interfere which you put up your line and running in the face walk and then all the other pairs that go in between the wall In between the two ends of the wall then you stagger them from one side of the wall to the other I'll just check with the tape maker. It's two 15 I know how to check it for full You need to use it your bolt level. I Have a big level. You're just checking the force cars for pull The reason Moving it out of the cells that I'll get the bottom there because the top part had to go in So I just want to get a film and so I'll have a two-fifth in Around there There's a bit of messing around get these pairs away but again a bit of time you spend the start Get the most easier is to build the way you're going up to the wall And as I said, don't pull too much longer into it. So what happened then is you're building along On your neck on this course here this is second course You get this far and then you just square period of the wall I'll say lots of examples of these pairs where I built about people do Because you build it long the quarter half block when you get to this point here Okay, and then you did the block straight up. I'm going to tap and then it this wall here is totally Attended from the pair the pair is just on the top so it's not getting many support with Just the correct way doing it so that these two wall is played into the pair So to create the pair he has one on its edge Up against the face of the wall and then we put two on flat and top of it Just check this one from down again And that way Take the bullet Take this way Take the bullet and there's no one Take that Take the slow pair at the point where it's all What happened now if you were running this in in the wall Okay, get up here lying set up here running down this way If you put this block the next block and pop it up and straight away it could have been the Longest way of the best way to put just a bottom on it Run the other blocks along it and then when you have them doing the opposite line You just struck a line and you just show the block and pop it up there Okay, that's it you don't have to do the pair into the middle of it not the wall you're doing I was just showing you how you toy it in and it's okay I'm going to do the job because it's very self-renewing Someone has a little bit of the wall probably built that thing So if you do not need to do it a bit longer that's how you throw your pair into the middle So okay
