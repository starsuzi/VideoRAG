 When it comes to making slip covers, they're pretty easy to make. It just takes a bit of time to construct them. The best thing to start off with is the chair that you want to cover and do a diagram of each panel that you are wanting to put together. So there are seven pieces. There is the back, the face, the sides, the seat, and the front. And by doing a diagram and taking your tape measure, you can simply go ahead and measure each of those angles. Now here's a tip when it comes to fabric. Go ahead and pre-wash your fabric. You want to make sure that it is washed because it will shrink once you wash this slip cover. Before you cut all of your pieces, you want to make sure that you leave at least an inch. That way you can go ahead and sew all the seams and know that you have enough room. If you cut on the line, you're not going to be able to join them together. Once you have all your measurements and all your pieces cut, the fun part of sewing them together is pretty easy. You want to basically take your drill pins and go ahead and pin the fabric together and sew and continue all the way around until you've got your piece sewn. You want to slip it on inside out to make sure that you have a nice fit. And the great thing about making your own slip covers is that it's very inexpensive. Normal slip cover at a store will run anywhere between 20 to 50 dollars per cover. For just under 40 dollars, I was able to buy enough material to cover six chairs. Just think of the money that you're saving. And there you go. You have it all done. And once it's fit nicely, you know all your edges are good. You then can pull it off and turn it inside out and slip it on. And there you have it. What was once an old chair that could have easily been tossed has been given some new life by adding a slip cover. To find out more about decorative slip covers, keep going around the website.
