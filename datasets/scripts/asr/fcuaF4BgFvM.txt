 Overall the toe just got normal wear and tear on it, but you'll see once I'm done it's gonna look brand new All right, so this morning I'm gonna be working on a bathtub that has some minor rust coming through some minor scratches and there's gonna be some silicone that needs to be removed from a previous shower door otherwise the tub's not in too bad a shape but I'm gonna definitely clean this up and I'll show you the process as we go. Here you can see the tub there's just some rust coming through, some scratches at the bottom and then you got some silicone here on the edge right there. Overall the tub just got normal wear and tear on it but you'll see once I'm done it's gonna look brand new. All right, so what I'm gonna do right now is I'm gonna put an acid edge on the tub. I'm gonna apply it and wipe it on the surface. I'm gonna use a sponge you can also use a brush the acid we use is a great product from NAPCO that is a dark brown the reason why we use the brown is so that it let's us see where we apply it to make sure we've got even coverage over the surface it's very important to acid wash the tub. I know some companies like to use just a primer we acid wash it so that way it deglosses it, ruffs it up so when we sand it it's rough and has something to it really adhere to. So that's what we're gonna do and always make sure you've got gloves on and you've got a mask on I've got my blower going and I'll show you all of that to make sure it helps with the fumes but it's extremely important that you do not skip this process. This is one of those things that you will not be able to do if you get like a major home center product they do not sell the acid to the public so make sure you're gonna use this is another reason why you should use a licensed refinishing company or reglazing company because you're gonna get the acids and the proper materials being used. Alright so I'm gonna get the acid going as you can see I put the window I've got my fan so I'll close the door to the bathroom and then I'll get going on applying the acid. So here we have the acid on it's a very light coat of acid this cup wasn't over the damage so you could either put a lot of acid and then rinse it off quicker but I'm just taking my time and I put a thin layer of acid and I let it sit for about a good 10-15 minutes and then you'll see that it'll dull it out take away the shine and then what I do is I rinse it with water and then I sand it I wet sand it with anywhere from 80 grit to 100 grit sandpaper. Alright so just got done acid washing I wet sanded it we always wet sand so you don't create a lot of dust as you can see it's real dull you're gonna see very minimal shine with the acid wash it's very dull some areas of this tub are still a little wet I have to dry it off completely but it's very dull cleaned off a lot of the silicone silicone's off where the old shower track was so now I'm gonna get ready to put a little putty on the bottom where there's the scratches and then I'll start taping and masking everything off here it is cleaned up I've got the putty on and I'm gonna let that dry then I'm gonna sand it so while it's drying I'm going to tape and mask off the area then all I need to do is lightly sand that down and then I'll go ahead and start prepping for spray. Alright here we go so as you can see I've got it sanded down I also sprayed a little bit of primer on this ledge this front ledge all the way down to help with the any leftover silicone residue it's I got it down pretty good pretty much down to the original but just in case I always spray some primer over the outer ledge everything's acid washed cleaned I wiped it down with a tack cloth got it taped and masked off and just getting ready to spray I'm gonna tape off the drain and get ready to spray alright so I'm getting ready to spray so I'm just gonna suit up get everything ready everything is covered the drain the drain is covered everything else is taped and masked off we will be ready to go very shortly I generally spray anywhere from three to four coats depending on the weather how much I reduce or thin out the material lately I've just been trying to reduce it minimal so I get a good nice three thick coats otherwise I'll go with a fourth coat but very thin just nice and wet to give it a good shine so here we go I'm getting ready to spray and re-glace this tub. Alright here we go we got first coat on this is the first coat you can see back in this corner it's a little hard to get the gun in but we'll still get it in as far as we can but the angle that it's going to be shot at is a little different than the front first coat we're probably going to do a good three to four even out the coverage looking good so far alright here we go second coat got the second coat on it filling everything in looking good over one to two more coats it's very important that you wait or whoever sprays it waits a good 10 to 15 minutes in between coats it's very common that re-glasers just try to rush through the coats alright final coat is on what I do is I come back after 48 hours and I do a final cleanup and polish of the area and then I recalk around the tub alright so I'm back here with the bathtub ready to clean it up I've already pulled the paper off now I'm getting ready to cock the tub I've already sanded down some little rough spots wiped it all down and just getting ready to do the final cocking around the perimeter so you can see the gap around I'm going to put the cocking in tug came out nice nice and thick coat looks good nice uniform shine you want consistency with the finish that's very important just so it looks gives that look of a brand new tub okay here we go tubs all done all the rest is gone it's cleaned up looking good good a nice shine to it PKV re-glasing if you need any refinishing or re-glasing needs just give us a call check out our website or Instagram Facebook check it all out PKV re-glasing alright just got back from finishing up that bathtub so I just wanted to do that to give you guys an idea as to what I actually do or what my business actually does I do work here every once in a while mainly for people that I know but my main business is in California and I've got seven guys that do the refinishing or the re-glasing of tubs we do for apartments hotels houses residential customers and so just to give you an idea but that is something it's an alternative that you guys can do it's a way less expensive than fully replacing if it's done right you're going to save ton of money and you're going to have a tub or a tile or a sink we can re-glase all of those that look brand new so just giving you guys a little home improvement information or another alternative to fully replacing so that's that's what I do my company's PKV re-glasing and it's in California so just want to let you guys know and also wanted to talk about some goals that we have we've got some goals of getting to a thousand subscribers within three months we've only been doing this for a little over two and a half months almost three months we're almost at a thousand subscribers we're just now approaching 800 and we're so grateful for everyone's support we also have a video the talkies challenge is from Braden and Nashlin and we really are trying to push that to a hundred thousand views right now it's about seventy one or seventy two thousand views really want to push that so just remember to like comment any of our challenge videos we really appreciate your support and don't forget choose your day
