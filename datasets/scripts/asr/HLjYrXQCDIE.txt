It's a really good rub into a crumble mixture. Just dot that in as you go. And you can be rough and tumble if you like. We're not looking for perfection. It's a lovely homemade dish this. And any cubes of marzipan on the top are brown really nicely. So that's everything packed in nice and snugly. I've got an orange here. I'm just going to put a little bit of the zest over the top. I'm going to give a real brightness to our pudding. Now for the custard mixture. I've got some golden caster sugar in a bowl. To that I'm going to add four eggs. Next a bit of vanilla. Now I'm using the paste, but you could use powder or extract, just whatever you've got. I'm going to use about half a teaspoon full. And finally some milk. And just whisk that all together. And then just pour this over the bread. And finally a little bit more sugar across the top. Just to give it that lovely crunchy finish. And then leave it to sit for about 10 minutes, just until it all really gets absorbed into the bread. And then bake it for about 45 minutes until it's cooked through golden brown. Use those kind of eggs like raspberry or other chocolate chips. And then just dig out the LOVE and mix with some lemon water. And then yep, don't worry.
