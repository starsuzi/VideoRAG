 Hi, my name is Wendy St. George and this is how to take care of teasing rings. When you first take a teasing ring out of the package It usually needs to be sterilized. Read the package. If you can you can put it in the dishwasher if it's dishwasher safe. Now this is just as hot as boiling water once you've run it through the cycle and that will sterilize your teasing ring. Later if it gets dirty you can always just put it back into the dishwasher but it's not necessary to do that every time a past past fire or a teasing ring is dropped. You can always just wash it with hot soaked in water and that will sterilize it enough for everyday use. You can also boil it if you don't have a dishwasher. So put a pot on the boil The pot boiling water drop the teasing ring or a past fire into the water and boil it for 10 minutes. Do not do this with water filled pastifiers or teasing rings as it can destroy them and make them pop. If you have a specialty teasing ring such as this you have to that's electronic. You have to be very careful just wash it carefully with soap and water hot water. Not going to be able to boil or sterilize it. This case.
