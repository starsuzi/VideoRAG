 Over time, garden chairs can grow a bit moldy, a little bit dirty and all they need is a little bit of love. Today I'm going to clean up this garden chair ready for it to be painted. All you need is some coarse sandpaper and a simple rubber wave at all of those chairs, cleaning off all excess dirt and mold. I've cleaned and sanded down the chair, now I'm going to apply the first coat of paint. One of our top tips is always to spray the underside of the chair first. The chair is now dry, I'm going to give it a couple of coats and that's ready to lighten up the garden.
