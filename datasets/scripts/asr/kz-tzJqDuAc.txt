 As if nothing serious will happen. I'm recording this guys got the crack staff here from Pelican assembling this got two guys working in one watching So here it is wins the afternoon and the hot tub is here It is on it's looking good Looking good all I got to do is get the electrical done fill it with water put some chemicals in and start enjoying it I'm making a movie of my new deck so I have to get you in on it too Oh you got the thingy how's the quality When you're full Alright put these together moving the gas line Getting a little setup with the new more tape and another gas drill Well it's now Monday the 16th of November and the lower deck is beginning to take shape Still need the steps and railings and this is going to be a shelf on this side of the bar on this side of the hot tub and Come around this side and Dave is starting to build a hatch frame the hatch out So we can get access to the pump and electrical components if we need to on a hot tub Come along it's Sunday November 23rd and The deck is almost done All the hot tub is in place the wiring is done. We've already used it several times All the decking is down on both the upper lower deck. We've still got railings to go and the skirt around the bottom And a couple other minor items, but other than that we're pretty much done here's a view of the expanded lower deck We added about 10 feet to it or so and There's still going to be a step Put in over by the upper deck and also on this side of the hot tub we're going to have a Tall shelf put in so that when we're in the hot tub we have a place to put drinks and paraphernalia and Here's a view from the other side a new step put in we're thinking about Maybe next spring we'll have this old slate sidewalk replaced with brick and maybe a small patio going out and around the the lore deck But Dave has done a great job. It really looks nice Gas grill is gonna go right there with a white chair There's Sally in the hot tub Right already have a video of the whole deck and I did that this morning, but I didn't have one of you in the hot tub Well, it's December the third and the deck is almost done Got to have some steps put in right here at the lore deck and if you're finishing the touches around But for the most part we are now done a nice But they borrow shelf that they built and New positioning of the grill the railings are up now The skirt along the bottom of the deck is done and my opinion looks a lot better than the old lattice work that we had so Sally and I are very happy with the results Really looks good We're looking forward to a nice
