 Okay, this is the pig's feet. I'm always cooking. So you spread out with the 3 pounds of pig's feet and pig hands. You boil the pig feet for about 5 minutes. Just give it some of that. Once you boil it for 5 minutes, you put it back in the pot. And then you put it in the pig's feet. Okay, so you put it on the 3 cups of water and pig's feet. Then you add 2 teaspoons of salt. And ground. And then you add 2 teaspoons of brown sugar. You put 1 teaspoon of sugar base. You put 3 cloves of garlic. And then you also add half a teaspoon of sesame oil. You put 2 teaspoons of dark soy sauce. You put that directly into the pot. And then also 3 cloves of garlic. So put a 1 teaspoon of black bean into the pot. Black beans, you can use the fresh kind like this. Or you can buy the jar kind, which is already mixed up in the jar. Okay, so you put 3 star anise into the pot. But this gives it a nice flavor. Then you cover the pot and boil the pig's feet with the ingredients for an hour and a half. There you have it. Chinese style pig feet. It's like a pig feet stew. Enjoy.
