 Hey guys, welcome to my channel. I'm gonna show you guys I'm gonna do some tutorial for Halloween and I hope you guys like it. So what I did is I started off with a NYX white jumbo pencil and I started carving out the places in my face that I'm gonna do the snake skin. I just went around where I wanted the snake skin to be, the design went around here, when all the way up here I did that beforehand because... Well, you did it. And I just applied it all over my face. No, I'm gonna blend that out. You guys can add anywhere where you want your snake skin to be, the snake design, you can add it anywhere on your face. Which is how I prefer it. And then I'm gonna start blending it out. I'm using an Elf's Mastivaline brush. I'm gonna add all the details below. I'm using this to create a base on my face because I'm already tan and I want the colors to be able to show out more. And so I'm using it as a base. I didn't spray some fix-plus. So, oh, big. Okay, so I can blend out better on my... I'm gonna put this hair knit. So I can start shaping out the scales. This is gonna look very funny. Before I start with the hair knit. I'm gonna go in with the max golden olive for to wear on top of my base. I'm gonna put a little bit of the lid on. A lot of cap. And then I'm gonna go in with the Anastasia Shadow for Toorfellet. And we're gonna go in with this shade right here, Metallic. The way to see a good Mary Shop. She had no children, only dolls. And if you see her in your dreams, you should never ever see her.
