 Okay first test the air-ed sign. It's taking me about six months to build this thing. It was a school project but I'm just finishing it off at home. Excuse me, I've got a bit of cold but I've got to go on to the very air can everything. See how we go. Yeah those outer rings are actually horribly incentric as you can see but that being a base plate isn't nor the fins are not too worried about it. I use working right. One of these wood is a strong air in and it's getting smashed against each of these edges when it comes off the edges of the roders. That's what their resonant noises will also fall to spin any faster than this in a game and louder. The quick ignoises just the air, laminated edge going over the voice. It's good to know it works. I'll still go and do another couple of balance checks on it. This one is slightly off the center as it's wobbling around a bit. But it is working there. This runs off the universal wash emoteer. Thanks for watching.
