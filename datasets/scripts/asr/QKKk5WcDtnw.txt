 Hey everyone, so today I'm gonna show you how to put the straps on the mini backpack like this because the straps come in actually four different straps, two short ones and two long ones so when you use it the S-a-back pack it's actually too long especially for my height I'm only 5 foot 1 so I cannot use this S-a-back pack with a default setting of the straps so I found a way while playing with it to use it as a backpack with just the ample length for my height so starting off you will be needing just the two straps the longer ones just the two long ones you won't be using the small ones for this so what I did was I I clasp one strap onto the top earring and then did this at the bottom at the end of this video I will be showing you some modeling shots so you will see how short the straps I mean how the length of the bag when worn as a backpack is for you know shorter girls so yeah so with a long strap you have the clasp here and then you have just one knob and then the holes of the strap and then this one I'm not sure what this one is called but it's like a piece of leather that can hold the strap so it won't be like too flimsy or anything so first off I will be putting this here on the top earring and then what you do so to insert this knob into the earring is that first thing you do is put it like this and then you have to move the strap sideways like this sideways into the earring and then push the knob inside wait we have to push it how do I do that yeah you have to push it inside just push it there and then there you go okay let's do it another time wait I'll zoom in so you can see better there so you put it like that and then maneuver it sideways like that and then you have to like align this with the bottom part of the earring so it will so it will go inside easily you have to put the knob first before this not at the back like that okay and then you can just push the knob inside yeah just push the knob inside one of the holes depending on your height or on your preference just push it um for my height I put it in here the third hole from the knob so one two three I just push it there and then you will have this loop over the earring and then the leather piece I just insert the um excess strap in here so it's the same with the other side looks like that there we go so it looks more like a backpack right now so I will do the modeling shots and and this video so that's it I hope this tip is helpful for anyone who is finding a way on how to shorten this straps to be able to use it as an actual backpack and thank you guys for watching and have a great day bye so you
