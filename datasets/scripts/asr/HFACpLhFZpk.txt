 Hi, my name is Sandy. I'm with the Maytome Services and I wanted to talk to you about how to clean soap scum from shower doors and bathroom tile and tub areas They are generally you'll treat them the same What you want to do is make sure that your your surface wherever you're going to clean your showers your soap scum make sure that it's dry and Then you'll make sure that you have a scrub pad. It's a blue 3M Scotch pad. You can buy it your local grocery store Make sure that it's dry. There's no need to pre-treat with a bunch of products Take your air tape just pick an area. I like to choose the worst one and Dry dry pad dry area where the soap scum is make sure that you just start Scrubbing it's actually just scraping away the soap scum it powders up So you just want to start scrubbing it off You can see the walt the walls where it turns white again Same for the shower or the tub area You may have to change your scrubbing strokes on this tub area. It works better going up and down Once you've gotten all of your scrubbing done and you've scraped away all the soap scum You want to just take some all-purpose cleaner bathroom cleaner It really just has to be all purpose because you're just rinsing the surface and Just giving it a good wipe You can use your hand to feel the surface. It's really nice and smooth and that will let you know that all your Silt scum is off you can scratch at it if there's anything under your nails It's still there then you would just redo the area the same way Using your scrub pad and then rinsing and that's how you clean soap scum off of your bathroom walls and shower doors
