 Today we're going to do a blue blow up with vinegar and baking soda. The vinegar is going to be popping up and the baking soda is going to be put. You carefully put the funnel on the balloon and then dump the baking soda in about two teaspoons. Okay, now dump the water in it. Hold it, dump it out there. And then we're going to take the funnel off that was loud. Yeah, and then we're going to, It's happy. And then we're going to put the balloon on the sink and then It's all going in. Well that's cool. It's like a video. Oh, grab it to the floor. Okay. What's up there, don't pull that. It's going to explode! Yeah, it's going to help point. Hold it that. It's going to explode. Hold the balloon up. Hold the balloon up. It's going there and there and there. Christian was making the balloon, but all the gas. What's the gas from? The vinegar and baking soda mixed together. It's not really cool, like a waterfall. Popping bottles. Well that's really good. It's not dry anymore. Do you have any last words? Please hit that like button. Smash that like button.
