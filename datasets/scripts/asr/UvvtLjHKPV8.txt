 Alright, hi guys. I want to see how well the Nutri-Pullet will grind coffee. It has a milling blade, which is this one, and I've used it to grind up some flax. So that tells me it should be able to grind some whole coffee beans. I've been using my little grinder, which is great, but it grinds after like a cup or two at a time. So I want to grind a little bit more. So I'm just going to take my beans. Let's lower this for you guys so you can see. I'm just going to pour that in. I remember there's a max line. I don't know if that's for beans or for water. Well, not beans per se, but for fruits and veggies. I think it's really just for water. Liquid, so I'll do this for now in any case. So I've got some beans in here. I'm going to put my milling blade on. And then I'll just put that right there. And... I mean, it looks pretty good. So I've got ground coffee guys. And there is the ground coffee. Okay, hi guys. Sorry, my camera ran out of memory card, so I quickly tried to speed up the video, but it wasn't quite finished. I just wanted to show you the coffee. So there it is. It's ground up and I let it go a little longer, so it's more fine because I like it finer. And this did a good job. You know, at least a good enough job. And now you're seeing the bottom more than focusing on my finger, but can the Nutri-Bullet grind coffee? It certainly can. So I'm going to have myself a cup and stay tuned for the next Nutri-Bullet video.
