 Welcome to Grandma Dye This Kitchen. I appreciate you tuning in. Thank you for tuning in. I have a special request today and I'm going to do... I have a special request for liver and onions. And you're going to need a pound of liver and what I did was... because you know I like to... I like to... to... to season my food and let it marinate for at least a couple hours. So I put... I only put garlic salt and a little pepper rica on it and let it seasoning. And then this is... you're going to need salt. That's one teaspoon of salt. Half a teaspoon of pepper rica. One teaspoon of sage. And one teaspoon of red pepper. And this is a half a cup of flour. This is what you're going to need to fry it with. Now this right here is what we're going to... this is a small onion. Okay? And this right here is... is a cup of chicken broth. And this right here is a tablespoon of lemon juice. And this is the... this is the oil we're going to fry it in which came as a half a cup of oil. And this is a fresh parsley. We're going to use this... but this is what we're going to put in the bag with the flour. So we have a half a cup of flour and we have... all of this we're going to... these are the dried ingredients we're going to put in the... the... the... ziplock bag. Now I... I wash my ziplock bags and reuse them because you can do that. You know? Next month I'll be 75 years old so I like to think that I learned something in all my years. And I give God all the praise and all the credit. Okay now what I do... I put the... the big pieces in. And then after they cook, after they fry, I cut them up because it's easier to fry that way if you... put the big pieces in. You know what I mean? Because you only got to let it cook for eight minutes. You don't... you don't want to... you're going to let it cook for eight minutes. Then you're going to take it out of the skillet and you're going to cut it up. And then we're going to use this flour that's... that's in the bag. And we're going to make the gravy with... with these. That's what we're going to make the gravy with. Okay? So the first thing we're going to do... so we're going to shake it real good. And the first thing we're going to do is go to the oven and we're going to... I'm sorry... we're going to go to the stove. Okay? And what we're going to do is take the oil right here. This is a half a cup of oil and we're going over to the stove. Okay? The oil is hot. So we're going to put the onions in. And we're going to let them cook until they're soft. We slice them. Remember they're sliced. And we slice them as thin as we can. And then we're going to let them... get soft. And then we're going to take them out. And then we're going to put the liver in. Okay? And so when this gets soft, we're going to take them out and put them in this plate right here. Put them aside. And then we're going to put the liver in. And we're going to cook the liver in this oil right here for eight minutes. And then I'll be back and show you what it looks like. I'm back. And now we see that the liver has been cooking for eight minutes. And so we're going to add back... we're going to put the onions back in it. You see how soft the onions are? Okay? We'll put it back in. And then we're going to add the parsley first, parsley. Okay? And we're going to add a tablespoon of lemon juice. The lemon juice... yep. The cheddar is rising. And then we're going to add... this is a cup full of chicken stock. And then we're going to cover it. And then we cook for about five minutes. So all I'm using is about five minutes. And then it'll be ready. And I'll come back and show you what it looks like. Okay? There you have it. Now I made a bowl of rice to go with that. I was going to make it in Mississippi. We eat rice with our liver and onions. So listen, there you have it. And I put a little fresh parsley on top of it. But this is what it looks like. And see I fried the pieces whole. Big pieces. And then I cut them up after they... after eight minutes. After they cooked for eight minutes. And you see this is the way the onions... Okay? So let's do a taste test. Okay? All right. I have a recipe already for the rice. But... Okay. All right. See there you have it. One pound makes enough for at least four people in a family. Okay? And you can use vegetables with it if you like. Let's taste it. You can get your vegetables that you like. And put with it. Okay? Let's try it. The onions are sweet. The liver is tender. And it depends on how much gravy you want. It's how much chicken stock you use. But you can use half, half, one, and half. You can stock also to make your gravy. So good. So good. Try it. It's good, good, good. And remember this is beef liver. Okay? So good. So there you have it. Very good. And it's good for you also. Happy eating to you. You
